Explaining Missing Entailments with Evee (Technical Report)","abstract":"Understanding logical entailments derived by a description logic reasoner is not always straight-forward for ontology users. For this reason, various methods for explaining entailments using justifications and proofs have been developed and implemented as plug-ins for the ontology editor Prot\\'eg\\'e. However, when the user expects a missing consequence to hold, it is equally important to explain why it does not follow from the ontology. In this paper, we describe a new version of $\\rm E{\\scriptsize VEE}$, a Prot\\'eg\\'e plugin that now also provides explanations for missing consequences, via existing and new techniques based on abduction and counterexamples.","sentences":["Understanding logical entailments derived by a description logic reasoner is not always straight-forward for ontology users.","For this reason, various methods for explaining entailments using justifications and proofs have been developed and implemented as plug-ins for the ontology editor Prot\\'eg\\'e.","However, when the user expects a missing consequence to hold, it is equally important to explain why it does not follow from the ontology.","In this paper, we describe a new version of $\\rm E{\\scriptsize VEE}$, a Prot\\'eg\\'e plugin that now also provides explanations for missing consequences, via existing and new techniques based on abduction and counterexamples."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07294v2"}
