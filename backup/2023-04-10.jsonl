{"title":"On the Evaluations of ChatGPT and Emotion-enhanced Prompting for Mental Health Analysis","abstract":"Automated mental health analysis shows great potential for enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of mental health care, whereas the recent dominant methods utilized pre-trained language models (PLMs) as the backbone and incorporated emotional information. The latest large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, exhibit dramatic capabilities on diverse natural language processing tasks. However, existing studies on ChatGPT's zero-shot performance for mental health analysis have limitations in inadequate evaluation, utilization of emotional information, and explainability of methods. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate the mental health analysis and emotional reasoning ability of ChatGPT on 11 datasets across 5 tasks, including binary and multi-class mental health condition detection, cause/factor detection of mental health conditions, emotion recognition in conversations, and causal emotion entailment. We empirically analyze the impact of different prompting strategies with emotional cues on ChatGPT's mental health analysis ability and explainability. Experimental results show that ChatGPT outperforms traditional neural network methods but still has a significant gap with advanced task-specific methods. The qualitative analysis shows its potential in explainability compared with advanced black-box methods but also limitations on robustness and inaccurate reasoning. Prompt engineering with emotional cues is found to be effective in improving its performance on mental health analysis but requires the proper way of emotion infusion.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03347v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"TagGPT: Large Language Models are Zero-shot Multimodal Taggers","abstract":"Tags are pivotal in facilitating the effective distribution of multimedia content in various applications in the contemporary Internet era, such as search engines and recommendation systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks. In this work, we propose TagGPT, a fully automated system capable of tag extraction and multimodal tagging in a completely zero-shot fashion. Our core insight is that, through elaborate prompt engineering, LLMs are able to extract and reason about proper tags given textual clues of multimodal data, e.g., OCR, ASR, title, etc. Specifically, to automatically build a high-quality tag set that reflects user intent and interests for a specific application, TagGPT predicts large-scale candidate tags from a series of raw data via prompting LLMs, filtered with frequency and semantics. Given a new entity that needs tagging for distribution, TagGPT introduces two alternative options for zero-shot tagging, i.e., a generative method with late semantic matching with the tag set, and another selective method with early matching in prompts. It is well noticed that TagGPT provides a system-level solution based on a modular framework equipped with a pre-trained LLM (GPT-3.5 used here) and a sentence embedding model (SimCSE used here), which can be seamlessly replaced with any more advanced one you want. TagGPT is applicable for various modalities of data in modern social media and showcases strong generalization ability to a wide range of applications. We evaluate TagGPT on publicly available datasets, i.e., Kuaishou and Food.com, and demonstrate the effectiveness of TagGPT compared to existing hashtags and off-the-shelf taggers.

{"title":"Evaluation of ChatGPT Family of Models for Biomedical Reasoning and Classification","abstract":"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive ability in biomedical question-answering, but have not been adequately investigated for more specific biomedical applications. This study investigates the performance of LLMs such as the ChatGPT family of models (GPT-3.5s, GPT-4) in biomedical tasks beyond question-answering. Because no patient data can be passed to the OpenAI API public interface, we evaluated model performance with over 10000 samples as proxies for two fundamental tasks in the clinical domain - classification and reasoning. The first task is classifying whether statements of clinical and policy recommendations in scientific literature constitute health advice. The second task is causal relation detection from the biomedical literature. We compared LLMs with simpler models, such as bag-of-words (BoW) with logistic regression, and fine-tuned BioBERT models. Despite the excitement around viral ChatGPT, we found that fine-tuning for two fundamental NLP tasks remained the best strategy. The simple BoW model performed on par with the most complex LLM prompting. Prompt engineering required significant investment.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02496v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Explainable Automated Debugging via Large Language Model-driven Scientific Debugging","abstract":"Automated debugging techniques have the potential to reduce developer effort in debugging, and have matured enough to be adopted by industry. However, one critical issue with existing techniques is that, while developers want rationales for the provided automatic debugging results, existing techniques are ill-suited to provide them, as their deduction process differs significantly from that of human developers. Inspired by the way developers interact with code when debugging, we propose Automated Scientific Debugging (AutoSD), a technique that given buggy code and a bug-revealing test, prompts large language models to automatically generate hypotheses, uses debuggers to actively interact with buggy code, and thus automatically reach conclusions prior to patch generation. By aligning the reasoning of automated debugging more closely with that of human developers, we aim to produce intelligible explanations of how a specific patch has been generated, with the hope that the explanation will lead to more efficient and accurate developer decisions. Our empirical analysis on three program repair benchmarks shows that AutoSD performs competitively with other program repair baselines, and that it can indicate when it is confident in its results. Furthermore, we perform a human study with 20 participants, including six professional developers, to evaluate the utility of explanations from AutoSD. Participants with access to explanations could judge patch correctness in roughly the same time as those without, but their accuracy improved for five out of six real-world bugs studied: 70% of participants answered that they wanted explanations when using repair tools, while 55% answered that they were satisfied with the Scientific Debugging presentation.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02195v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

Furthermore, we examine the development of context-specific search engines and the potential of LLMs to become a natural interface for complex tasks, such as data analysis and design. We also develop a unified interface using natural language to handle complex geotechnical engineering tasks and data analysis.

{"title":"On the Prime Number Divisibility by Deep Learning","abstract":"Certain tasks such as determining whether a given integer can be divided by 2, 3, or other prime numbers may be trivial for human beings, but can be less straightforward for computers in the absence of pre-specified algorithms. In this paper, we tested multiple deep learning architectures and feature engineering approaches, and evaluated the scenario of determining divisibility of large finite integers (up to $2^{32}$) by small prime numbers. It turns out that, regardless of the network frameworks or the complexity of the network structures (CNN, RNN, Transformer, etc.), the ability to predict the prime number divisibility critically depends on the feature space fed into the deep learning models. We also evaluated commercially available Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) pipelines from Amazon, Google and Microsoft, and demonstrated that they failed to address this issue unless appropriately engineered features were provided. We further proposed a closed form solution to the problem using the ordinary linear regression on Fourier series basis vectors, and showed its success. Finally, we evaluated prompt-based learning using ChatGPT and demonstrated its success on small primes and apparent failures on larger primes. We conclude that feature engineering remains an important task to improve the performance, increase the interpretability, and reduce the complexity of machine learning/deep learning models, even in the era of AutoML and large-language models (LLMs).","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01333v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Keep the Conversation Going: Fixing 162 out of 337 bugs for $0.42 each using ChatGPT","abstract":"Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate patches for buggy programs. Recent APR work has been focused on leveraging modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly generate patches for APR. Such LLM-based APR tools work by first constructing an input prompt built using the original buggy code and then queries the LLM to generate patches. While the LLM-based APR tools are able to achieve state-of-the-art results, it still follows the classic Generate and Validate repair paradigm of first generating lots of patches and then validating each one afterwards. This not only leads to many repeated patches that are incorrect but also miss the crucial information in test failures as well as in plausible patches.   To address these limitations, we propose ChatRepair, the first fully automated conversation-driven APR approach that interleaves patch generation with instant feedback to perform APR in a conversational style. ChatRepair first feeds the LLM with relevant test failure information to start with, and then learns from both failures and successes of earlier patching attempts of the same bug for more powerful APR. For earlier patches that failed to pass all tests, we combine the incorrect patches with their corresponding relevant test failure information to construct a new prompt for the LLM to generate the next patch. In this way, we can avoid making the same mistakes. For earlier patches that passed all the tests, we further ask the LLM to generate alternative variations of the original plausible patches. In this way, we can further build on and learn from earlier successes to generate more plausible patches to increase the chance of having correct patches. While our approach is general, we implement ChatRepair using state-of-the-art dialogue-based LLM -- ChatGPT. By calculating the cost of accessing ChatGPT, we can fix 162 out of 337 bugs for \\$0.42 each!","created":"2023-04-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00385v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Pair Programming with Large Language Models for Sampling and Estimation of Copulas","abstract":"Without writing a single line of code by a human, an example Monte Carlo simulation based application for stochastic dependence modeling with copulas is developed using a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for conversations. This includes interaction with ChatGPT in natural language and using mathematical formalism, which, under careful supervision by a human-expert, led to producing a working code in MATLAB, Python and R for sampling from a given copula model, evaluation of the model's density, performing maximum likelihood estimation, optimizing the code for parallel computing for CPUs as well as for GPUs, and visualization of the computed results. In contrast to other emerging studies that assess the accuracy of LLMs like ChatGPT on tasks from a selected area, this work rather investigates ways how to achieve a successful solution of a standard statistical task in a collaboration of a human-expert and artificial intelligence (AI). Particularly, through careful prompt engineering, we separate successful solutions generated by ChatGPT from unsuccessful ones, resulting in a comprehensive list of related pros and cons. It is demonstrated that if the typical pitfalls are avoided, we can substantially benefit from collaborating with an AI partner. For example, we show that if ChatGPT is not able to provide a correct solution due to a lack of or incorrect knowledge, the human-expert can feed it with the correct knowledge, e.g., in the form of mathematical theorems and formulas, and make it to apply the gained knowledge in order to provide a solution that is correct. Such ability presents an attractive opportunity to achieve a programmed solution even for users with rather limited knowledge of programming techniques.","created":"2023-03-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18116v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Towards Enhancing In-Context Learning for Code Generation","abstract":"In-context learning (ICL) with pre-trained language models (PTLMs) has shown great success in code generation. ICL does not require training. PTLMs take as the input a prompt consisting of a few requirement-code examples and a new requirement, and output a new program. However, existing studies simply reuse ICL techniques for natural language generation and ignore unique features of code generation. We refer to these studies as standard ICL.   Inspired by observations of the human coding process, we propose a novel ICL approach for code generation named AceCoder. Compared to standard ICL, AceCoder has two novelties. (1) Example retrieval. It retrieves similar programs as examples and learns programming skills (e.g., algorithms, APIs) from them. (2) Guided Code Generation. It encourages PTLMs to output an intermediate preliminary (e.g., test cases, APIs) before generating programs. The preliminary can help PTLMs understand requirements and guide the next code generation. We apply AceCoder to six PTLMs (e.g., Codex) and evaluate it on three public benchmarks using the Pass@k. Results show that AceCoder can significantly improve the performance of PTLMs on code generation. (1) In terms of Pass@1, AceCoder outperforms standard ICL by up to 79.7% and fine-tuned models by up to 171%. (2) AceCoder is effective in PTLMs with different sizes (e.g., 1B to 175B) and different languages (e.g., Python, Java, and JavaScript). (3) We investigate multiple choices of the intermediate preliminary. (4) We manually evaluate generated programs in three aspects and prove the superiority of AceCoder.

{"title":"Humans in Humans Out: On GPT Converging Toward Common Sense in both Success and Failure","abstract":"Increase in computational scale and fine-tuning has seen a dramatic improvement in the quality of outputs of large language models (LLMs) like GPT. Given that both GPT-3 and GPT-4 were trained on large quantities of human-generated text, we might ask to what extent their outputs reflect patterns of human thinking, both for correct and incorrect cases. The Erotetic Theory of Reason (ETR) provides a symbolic generative model of both human success and failure in thinking, across propositional, quantified, and probabilistic reasoning, as well as decision-making. We presented GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 with 61 central inference and judgment problems from a recent book-length presentation of ETR, consisting of experimentally verified data-points on human judgment and extrapolated data-points predicted by ETR, with correct inference patterns as well as fallacies and framing effects (the ETR61 benchmark). ETR61 includes classics like Wason's card task, illusory inferences, the decoy effect, and opportunity-cost neglect, among others. GPT-3 showed evidence of ETR-predicted outputs for 59% of these examples, rising to 77% in GPT-3.5 and 75% in GPT-4. Remarkably, the production of human-like fallacious judgments increased from 18% in GPT-3 to 33% in GPT-3.5 and 34% in GPT-4. This suggests that larger and more advanced LLMs may develop a tendency toward more human-like mistakes, as relevant thought patterns are inherent in human-produced training data. According to ETR, the same fundamental patterns are involved both in successful and unsuccessful ordinary reasoning, so that the \"bad\" cases could paradoxically be learned from the \"good\" cases. We further present preliminary evidence that ETR-inspired prompt engineering could reduce instances of these mistakes.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17276v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"ProtFIM: Fill-in-Middle Protein Sequence Design via Protein Language Models","abstract":"Protein language models (pLMs), pre-trained via causal language modeling on protein sequences, have been a promising tool for protein sequence design. In real-world protein engineering, there are many cases where the amino acids in the middle of a protein sequence are optimized while maintaining other residues. Unfortunately, because of the left-to-right nature of pLMs, existing pLMs modify suffix residues by prompting prefix residues, which are insufficient for the infilling task that considers the whole surrounding context. To find the more effective pLMs for protein engineering, we design a new benchmark, Secondary structureE InFilling rEcoveRy, SEIFER, which approximates infilling sequence design scenarios. With the evaluation of existing models on the benchmark, we reveal the weakness of existing language models and show that language models trained via fill-in-middle transformation, called ProtFIM, are more appropriate for protein engineering. Also, we prove that ProtFIM generates protein sequences with decent protein representations through exhaustive experiments and visualizations.","created":"2023-03-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16452v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

By measuring the syntactic validity and execution accuracy metrics of the generated OCL constraints, we found that enriching the prompts with UML information and enabling few-shot learning increases the reliability of the generated OCL constraints. Furthermore, the results reveal a close similarity based on sentence embedding between the generated OCL constraints and the human-written ones in the ground truth, implying a level of clarity and understandability in the generated OCL constraints by Codex.","created":"2023-03-28","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16244v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

By using a variety of new and existing analysis techniques we probe the spectral and temporal evolution of GRB 221009A. We find no emission prior to the GBM trigger time (t0; 2022 October 9 at 13:16:59.99 UTC), indicating that this is the time of prompt emission onset.

{"title":"Revisiting the Plastic Surgery Hypothesis via Large Language Models","abstract":"Automated Program Repair (APR) aspires to automatically generate patches for an input buggy program. Traditional APR tools typically focus on specific bug types and fixes through the use of templates, heuristics, and formal specifications. However, these techniques are limited in terms of the bug types and patch variety they can produce. As such, researchers have designed various learning-based APR tools with recent work focused on directly using Large Language Models (LLMs) for APR. While LLM-based APR tools are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on many repair datasets, the LLMs used for direct repair are not fully aware of the project-specific information such as unique variable or method names.   The plastic surgery hypothesis is a well-known insight for APR, which states that the code ingredients to fix the bug usually already exist within the same project. Traditional APR tools have largely leveraged the plastic surgery hypothesis by designing manual or heuristic-based approaches to exploit such existing code ingredients. However, as recent APR research starts focusing on LLM-based approaches, the plastic surgery hypothesis has been largely ignored. In this paper, we ask the following question: How useful is the plastic surgery hypothesis in the era of LLMs? Interestingly, LLM-based APR presents a unique opportunity to fully automate the plastic surgery hypothesis via fine-tuning and prompting. To this end, we propose FitRepair, which combines the direct usage of LLMs with two domain-specific fine-tuning strategies and one prompting strategy for more powerful APR. Our experiments on the widely studied Defects4j 1.2 and 2.0 datasets show that FitRepair fixes 89 and 44 bugs (substantially outperforming the best-performing baseline by 15 and 8), respectively, demonstrating a promising future of the plastic surgery hypothesis in the era of LLMs.","created":"2023-03-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10494v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

Existing works on prompt engineering, which either require laborious manual designs or optimize the prompt tuning as a point estimation problem, may fail to describe diverse characteristics of categories and limit their applications. We introduce a Bayesian probabilistic resolution to prompt learning, where the label-specific stochastic prompts are generated hierarchically by first sampling a latent vector from an underlying distribution and then employing a lightweight generative model. Importantly, we semantically regularize prompt learning with the visual knowledge and view images and the corresponding prompts as patch and token sets under optimal transport, which pushes the prompt tokens to faithfully capture the label-specific visual concepts, instead of overfitting the training categories. Moreover, the proposed model can also be straightforwardly extended to the conditional case where the instance-conditional prompts are generated to improve the generalizability. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets show promising transferability and generalization performance of our proposed model.","created":"2023-03-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09100v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"UPRISE: Universal Prompt Retrieval for Improving Zero-Shot Evaluation","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) are popular for their impressive abilities, but the need for model-specific fine-tuning or task-specific prompt engineering can hinder their generalization. We propose UPRISE (Universal Prompt Retrieval for Improving zero-Shot Evaluation), which tunes a lightweight and versatile retriever that automatically retrieves prompts for a given zero-shot task input. Specifically, we demonstrate universality in a cross-task and cross-model scenario: the retriever is tuned on a diverse set of tasks, but tested on unseen task types; we use a small frozen LLM, GPT-Neo-2.7B, for tuning the retriever, but test the retriever on different LLMs of much larger scales, such as BLOOM-7.1B, OPT-66B and GPT3-175B. Additionally, we show that UPRISE mitigates the hallucination problem in our experiments with ChatGPT, suggesting its potential to improve even the strongest LLMs. Our model and code are available at https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps.","created":"2023-03-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08518v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"InferFix: End-to-End Program Repair with LLMs","abstract":"Software development life cycle is profoundly influenced by bugs: their introduction, identification, and eventual resolution account for a significant portion of software cost. This has motivated software engineering researchers and practitioners to propose different approaches for automating the identification and repair of software defects. Large language models have been adapted to the program repair task through few-shot demonstration learning and instruction prompting, treating this as an infilling task. However, these models have only focused on learning general bug-fixing patterns for uncategorized bugs mined from public repositories. In this paper, we propose InferFix: a transformer-based program repair framework paired with a state-of-the-art static analyzer to fix critical security and performance bugs. InferFix combines a Retriever -- transformer encoder model pretrained via contrastive learning objective, which aims at searching for semantically equivalent bugs and corresponding fixes; and a Generator -- a large language model (Codex Cushman) finetuned on supervised bug-fix data with prompts augmented via bug type annotations and semantically similar fixes retrieved from an external non-parametric memory. To train and evaluate our approach, we curated InferredBugs, a novel, metadata-rich dataset of bugs extracted by executing the Infer static analyzer on the change histories of thousands of Java and C# repositories. Our evaluation demonstrates that InferFix outperforms strong LLM baselines, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.6% for generating fixes in C# and 76.8% in Java. We discuss the deployment of InferFix alongside Infer at Microsoft which offers an end-to-end solution for detection, classification, and localization of bugs, as well as fixing and validation of candidate patches, integrated in the continuous integration pipeline to automate the software development workflow.","created":"2023-03-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07263v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Prompting AI Art: An Investigation into the Creative Skill of Prompt Engineering","abstract":"Humankind is entering a novel era of creativity - an era in which anybody can synthesize digital content. The paradigm under which this revolution takes place is prompt-based learning (or in-context learning). This paradigm has found fruitful application in text-to-image generation where it is being used to synthesize digital images from zero-shot text prompts in natural language for the purpose of creating AI art. This activity is referred to as prompt engineering - the practice of iteratively crafting prompts to generate and improve images. In this paper, we investigate prompt engineering as a novel creative skill for creating prompt-based art. In three studies with participants recruited from a crowdsourcing platform, we explore whether untrained participants could 1) recognize the quality of prompts, 2) write prompts, and 3) improve their prompts. Our results indicate that participants could assess the quality of prompts and respective images. This ability increased with the participants' experience and interest in art. Participants further were able to write prompts in rich descriptive language. However, even though participants were specifically instructed to generate artworks, participants' prompts were missing the specific vocabulary needed to apply a certain style to the generated images. Our results suggest that prompt engineering is a learned skill that requires expertise and practice. Based on our findings and experience with running our studies with participants recruited from a crowdsourcing platform, we provide ten recommendations for conducting experimental research on text-to-image generation and prompt engineering with a paid crowd. Our studies offer a deeper understanding of prompt engineering thereby opening up avenues for research on the future of prompt engineering. We conclude by speculating on four possible futures of prompt engineering.","created":"2023-03-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13534v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

We explore multiple approaches to text classification, including supervised approaches such as traditional models like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as DeBERTa. We compare them with Large Language Models (LLMs) used in both few-shot and zero-shot classification settings. To accomplish this task, we employ prompt engineering, a technique that involves designing prompts to guide the LLMs towards the desired output. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of two commercially available state-of-the-art GPT-3.5-based language models, text-davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo. We also conduct a detailed analysis of the impact of different aspects of prompt engineering on the model's performance. Our results show that, with a well-designed prompt, a zero-shot gpt-3.5-turbo classifier outperforms all other models, achieving a 6% increase in Precision@95% Recall compared to the best supervised approach. Furthermore, we observe that the wording of the prompt is a critical factor in eliciting the appropriate \"reasoning\" in the model, and that seemingly minor aspects of the prompt significantly affect the model's performance.","created":"2023-03-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07142v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Evidence for self-organized criticality phenomena in prompt phase of short gamma-ray bursts","abstract":"The prompt phase of gamma-ray burst (GRB) contains essential information regarding the physical nature and central engine, which are as yet unknown. In this paper, we investigate the self-organized criticality (SOC) phenomena in GRB prompt phase as done in X-ray flares of GRBs. We obtain the differential and cumulative distributions of 243 short GRB pulses, such as peak flux, FWHM, rise time, decay time, and peak time in the fourth BATSE TTE Catalog with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. It is found that these distributions can be well described by power-law models. In particular, comparisons are made in 182 short GRB pulses in the third Swift GRB Catalog from 2004 December to 2019 July. The results are essentially consistent with those in BATSE ones. We notice that there is no obvious power-law index evolution across different energy bands for either BATSE or Swift sGRBs. The joint analysis suggests that GRB prompt phase can be explained by a Fractal-Diffusive, Self-Organized Criticality (FD-SOC) system with the spatial dimension S = 3 and the classical diffusion ? = 1. Our findings show that GRB prompt phases and X-ray flares possess the very same magnetically dominated stochastic process and mechanism.","created":"2023-03-12","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06667v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"Susceptibility to Influence of Large Language Models","abstract":"Two studies tested the hypothesis that a Large Language Model (LLM) can be used to model psychological change following exposure to influential input. The first study tested a generic mode of influence - the Illusory Truth Effect (ITE) - where earlier exposure to a statement (through, for example, rating its interest) boosts a later truthfulness test rating. Data was collected from 1000 human participants using an online experiment, and 1000 simulated participants using engineered prompts and LLM completion. 64 ratings per participant were collected, using all exposure-test combinations of the attributes: truth, interest, sentiment and importance. The results for human participants reconfirmed the ITE, and demonstrated an absence of effect for attributes other than truth, and when the same attribute is used for exposure and test. The same pattern of effects was found for LLM-simulated participants. The second study concerns a specific mode of influence - populist framing of news to increase its persuasion and political mobilization. Data from LLM-simulated participants was collected and compared to previously published data from a 15-country experiment on 7286 human participants. Several effects previously demonstrated from the human study were replicated by the simulated study, including effects that surprised the authors of the human study by contradicting their theoretical expectations (anti-immigrant framing of news decreases its persuasion and mobilization); but some significant relationships found in human data (modulation of the effectiveness of populist framing according to relative deprivation of the participant) were not present in the LLM data. Together the two studies support the view that LLMs have potential to act as models of the effect of influence.","created":"2023-03-10","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06074v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Automating Method Naming with Context-Aware Prompt-Tuning","abstract":"Method names are crucial to program comprehension and maintenance. Recently, many approaches have been proposed to automatically recommend method names and detect inconsistent names. Despite promising, their results are still sub-optimal considering the three following drawbacks: 1) These models are mostly trained from scratch, learning two different objectives simultaneously. The misalignment between two objectives will negatively affect training efficiency and model performance. 2) The enclosing class context is not fully exploited, making it difficult to learn the abstract function of the method. 3) Current method name consistency checking methods follow a generate-then-compare process, which restricts the accuracy as they highly rely on the quality of generated names and face difficulty measuring the semantic consistency.   In this paper, we propose an approach named AUMENA to AUtomate MEthod NAming tasks with context-aware prompt-tuning. Unlike existing deep learning based approaches, our model first learns the contextualized representation(i.e., class attributes) of PL and NL through the pre-training model, then fully exploits the capacity and knowledge of large language model with prompt-tuning to precisely detect inconsistent method names and recommend more accurate names. To better identify semantically consistent names, we model the method name consistency checking task as a two-class classification problem, avoiding the limitation of previous similarity-based consistency checking approaches. The experimental results reflect that AUMENA scores 68.6%, 72.0%, 73.6%, 84.7% on four datasets of method name recommendation, surpassing the state-of-the-art baseline by 8.5%, 18.4%, 11.0%, 12.0%, respectively.

{"title":"Greener yet Powerful: Taming Large Code Generation Models with Quantization","abstract":"ML-powered code generation aims to assist developers to write code in a more productive manner, by intelligently generating code blocks based on natural language prompts. Recently, large pretrained deep learning models have substantially pushed the boundary of code generation and achieved impressive performance. Despite their great power, the huge number of model parameters poses a significant threat to adapting them in a regular software development environment, where a developer might use a standard laptop or mid-size server to develop her code. Such large models incur significant resource usage (in terms of memory, latency, and dollars) as well as carbon footprint.   Model compression is a promising approach to address these challenges. Several techniques are proposed to compress large pretrained models typically used for vision or textual data. Out of many available compression techniques, we identified that quantization is mostly applicable for code generation task as it does not require significant retraining cost. As quantization represents model parameters with lower-bit integer (e.g., int8), the model size and runtime latency would both benefit from such int representation. We extensively study the impact of quantized model on code generation tasks across different dimension: (i) resource usage and carbon footprint, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) robustness. To this end, through systematic experiments we find a recipe of quantization technique that could run even a $6$B model in a regular laptop without significant accuracy or robustness degradation. We further found the recipe is readily applicable to code summarization task as well.","created":"2023-03-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05378v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

These systems have immediately received lots of attention from researchers, creators, and common users. Despite the plenty of efforts to improve the generative models, there is limited work on understanding the information needs of the users of these systems at scale. We conduct the first comprehensive analysis of large-scale prompt logs collected from multiple text-to-image generation systems. Our work is analogous to analyzing the query logs of Web search engines, a line of work that has made critical contributions to the glory of the Web search industry and research. Compared with Web search queries, text-to-image prompts are significantly longer, often organized into special structures that consist of the subject, form, and intent of the generation tasks and present unique categories of information needs. Users make more edits within creation sessions, which present remarkable exploratory patterns. There is also a considerable gap between the user-input prompts and the captions of the images included in the open training data of the generative models.

{"title":"Extracting Accurate Materials Data from Research Papers with Conversational Language Models and Prompt Engineering -- Example of ChatGPT","abstract":"There has been a growing effort to replace hand extraction of data from research papers with automated data extraction based on natural language processing (NLP), language models (LMs), and recently, large language models (LLMs). Although these methods enable efficient extraction of data from large sets of research papers, they require a significant amount of up-front effort, expertise, and coding. In this work we propose the ChatExtract method that can fully automate very accurate data extraction with essentially no initial effort or background using an advanced conversational LLM (or AI). ChatExtract consists of a set of engineered prompts applied to a conversational LLM that both identify sentences with data, extract data, and assure its correctness through a series of follow-up questions. These follow-up questions address a critical challenge associated with LLMs - their tendency to provide factually inaccurate responses. ChatExtract can be applied with any conversational LLMs and yields very high quality data extraction. In tests on materials data we find precision and recall both over 90% from the best conversational LLMs, likely rivaling or exceeding human accuracy in many cases. We demonstrate that the exceptional performance is enabled by the information retention in a conversational model combined with purposeful redundancy and introducing uncertainty through follow-up prompts. These results suggest that approaches similar to ChatExtract, due to their simplicity, transferability and accuracy are likely to replace other methods of data extraction in the near future.","created":"2023-03-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05352v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

In this first of a two-paper series, we present a detailed analysis of three Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of AT 2018cow covering $\\sim$50-60 days post-explosion, which provide significantly improved constraints of the fading prompt emission and late thermal properties. By modeling the Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs), we confirm that the UV-optical emission over 50-60 days was still a smooth blackbody (i.e., optically thick) with a high temperature ($T_{\\mathrm{BB}}\\sim15000\\,\\mathrm{K}$) and small radius ($R_{\\mathrm{BB}}\\lesssim1000\\,R_\\odot$). Additionally, we report for the first time a break in the bolometric light curve: the thermal luminosity initially declined at a rate of $L_{\\mathrm{BB}}\\propto t^{-2.40}$, but faded much faster at $t^{-3.06}$ after day 13. Re-examining possible late-time power sources, we disfavor significant contributions from radioactive decay based on the required $^{56}$Ni mass and the complete lack of UV line blanketing in the HST SEDs. We argue that the commonly-proposed interaction with circumstellar material may face significant challenges in explaining the late thermal properties, particularly the effects of optical depth. Alternatively, we find that continuous outflow/wind driven by a central engine can still reasonably explain the combination of receding photosphere, optically thick and rapid fading emission, as well as the intermediate-width lines. However, the rapid fading may have further implications on the power output of the engine and structure of the wind. Our findings may support the hypothesis that AT 2018cow and other ``Cow-like transients'' are powered mainly by accretion onto a central engine.","created":"2023-03-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03500v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Prompting Large Language Models with Answer Heuristics for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering","abstract":"Knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) requires external knowledge beyond the image to answer the question. Early studies retrieve required knowledge from explicit knowledge bases (KBs), which often introduces irrelevant information to the question, hence restricting the performance of their models. Recent works have sought to use a large language model (i.e., GPT-3) as an implicit knowledge engine to acquire the necessary knowledge for answering. Despite the encouraging results achieved by these methods, we argue that they have not fully activated the capacity of GPT-3 as the provided input information is insufficient. In this paper, we present Prophet -- a conceptually simple framework designed to prompt GPT-3 with answer heuristics for knowledge-based VQA. Specifically, we first train a vanilla VQA model on a specific knowledge-based VQA dataset without external knowledge. After that, we extract two types of complementary answer heuristics from the model: answer candidates and answer-aware examples. Finally, the two types of answer heuristics are encoded into the prompts to enable GPT-3 to better comprehend the task thus enhancing its capacity. Prophet significantly outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets, OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, delivering 61.1% and 55.7% accuracies on their testing sets, respectively.","created":"2023-03-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01903v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"A variational quantum algorithm-based numerical method for solving potential and Stokes flows","abstract":"This paper presents a numerical method based on the variational quantum algorithm to solve potential and Stokes flow problems. In this method, the governing equations for potential and Stokes flows can be respectively written in the form of Laplace's equation and Stokes equations using velocity potential, stream function and vorticity formulations. Then the finite difference method and the generalised differential quadrature (GDQ) method are applied to discretize the governing equations. For the prescribed boundary conditions, the corresponding linear systems of equations can be obtained. These linear systems are solved by using the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), which resolves the potential and Stokes flow problems equivalently. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first study that incorporates the GDQ method which is inherently a high-order discretization method with the VQLS algorithm. Since the GDQ method can utilize much fewer grid points than the finite difference method to approximate derivatives with a higher order of accuracy, the size of the input matrix for the VQLS algorithm can be smaller. In this way, the computational cost may be saved. The performance of the present method is comprehensively assessed by two representative examples, namely, the potential flow around a circular cylinder and Stokes flow in a lid-driven cavity. Numerical results validate the applicability and accuracy of the present VQLS-based method. Furthermore, its time complexity is evaluated by the heuristic scaling, which demonstrates that the present method scales efficiently in the number of qubits and the precision. This work brings quantum computing to the field of computational fluid dynamics. By virtue of quantum advantage over classical methods, promising advances in solving large-scale fluid mechanics problems of engineering interest may be prompted.","created":"2023-03-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01805v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

However, an accurate measurement of the prompt emission properties of this burst is very challenging due to its exceptional brightness. With joint observations of \\textit{Insight}-HXMT and GECAM-C, we made an unprecedentedly accurate measurement of the emission during the first $\\sim$1800 s of GRB 221009A, including its precursor, main emission (ME, which dominates the burst in flux), flaring emission and early afterglow, in the hard X-ray to soft gamma-ray band from $\\sim$ 10 keV to $\\sim$ 6 MeV. Based on the GECAM-C unsaturated data of the ME, we measure a record-breaking isotropic equivalent energy ($E_{\\rm iso}$) of $\\bf \\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{55}$ erg, which is about eight times the total rest-mass energy of the Sun. The early afterglow data require a significant jet break between 650 s and 1100 s, most likely at $\\sim950$ s from the afterglow starting time $T_{AG}$, which corresponds to a jet opening angle of $\\sim {0.7^\\circ} \\ (\\eta_\\gamma n)^{1/8}$, where $n$ is the ambient medium density in units of $\\rm cm^{-3}$ and $\\eta_\\gamma$ is the ratio between $\\gamma$-ray energy and afterglow kinetic energy.

Existing methods are trying to communicate visual concepts as prompts to frozen language models, but rely on hand-engineered task induction to reduce the hypothesis space. To make the whole process learnable, we introduce a multimodal meta-learning approach. Specifically, our approach decomposes the training of the model into a set of related multimodal few-shot tasks. We define a meta-mapper network, acting as a meta-learner, to efficiently bridge frozen large-scale vision and language models and leverage their already learned capacity. By updating the learnable parameters only of the meta-mapper, it learns to accrue shared meta-knowledge among these tasks. Thus, it can rapidly adapt to newly presented samples with only a few gradient updates. Importantly, it induces the task in a completely data-driven manner, with no need for a hand-engineered task induction. We evaluate our approach on recently proposed multimodal few-shot benchmarks, measuring how rapidly the model can bind novel visual concepts to words and answer visual questions by observing only a limited set of labeled examples. The experimental results show that our meta-learning approach outperforms the baseline across multiple datasets and various training settings while being computationally more efficient.","created":"2023-02-28","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14794v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"Automatic Prompt Augmentation and Selection with Chain-of-Thought from Labeled Data","abstract":"Chain-of-thought prompting (CoT) advances the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) and achieves superior performance in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, most CoT studies rely on carefully designed human-annotated rational chains to prompt the language model, which poses challenges for real-world applications where labeled training data is available without human-annotated rational chains. This creates barriers to applications of CoT prompting to these general tasks. This paper proposes a new strategy, Automate-CoT (Automatic Prompt Augmentation and Selection with Chain-of-Thought), that can bypass human engineering of CoTs by automatically augmenting rational chains from a small labeled dataset, and then pruning low-quality chains to construct a candidate pool of machine-generated rationale chains based on the labels. Finally, it selects the optimal combination of several rationale chains from the pool for CoT prompting by employing a variance-reduced policy gradient strategy to estimate the significance of each example in a black-box language model. Automate-CoT enables a quick adaptation of the CoT technique to different tasks.

{"title":"Dr ChatGPT, tell me what I want to hear: How prompt knowledge impacts health answer correctness","abstract":"Generative pre-trained language models (GPLMs) like ChatGPT encode in the model's parameters knowledge the models observe during the pre-training phase. This knowledge is then used at inference to address the task specified by the user in their prompt. For example, for the question-answering task, the GPLMs leverage the knowledge and linguistic patterns learned at training to produce an answer to a user question. Aside from the knowledge encoded in the model itself, answers produced by GPLMs can also leverage knowledge provided in the prompts. For example, a GPLM can be integrated into a retrieve-then-generate paradigm where a search engine is used to retrieve documents relevant to the question; the content of the documents is then transferred to the GPLM via the prompt. In this paper we study the differences in answer correctness generated by ChatGPT when leveraging the model's knowledge alone vs. in combination with the prompt knowledge. We study this in the context of consumers seeking health advice from the model. Aside from measuring the effectiveness of ChatGPT in this context, we show that the knowledge passed in the prompt can overturn the knowledge encoded in the model and this is, in our experiments, to the detriment of answer correctness. This work has important implications for the development of more robust and transparent question-answering systems based on generative pre-trained language models.","created":"2023-02-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13793v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"More than you've asked for: A Comprehensive Analysis of Novel Prompt Injection Threats to Application-Integrated Large Language Models","abstract":"We are currently witnessing dramatic advances in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). They are already being adopted in practice and integrated into many systems, including integrated development environments (IDEs) and search engines. The functionalities of current LLMs can be modulated via natural language prompts, while their exact internal functionality remains implicit and unassessable. This property, which makes them adaptable to even unseen tasks, might also make them susceptible to targeted adversarial prompting. Recently, several ways to misalign LLMs using Prompt Injection (PI) attacks have been introduced. In such attacks, an adversary can prompt the LLM to produce malicious content or override the original instructions and the employed filtering schemes. Recent work showed that these attacks are hard to mitigate, as state-of-the-art LLMs are instruction-following. So far, these attacks assumed that the adversary is directly prompting the LLM.   In this work, we show that augmenting LLMs with retrieval and API calling capabilities (so-called Application-Integrated LLMs) induces a whole new set of attack vectors. These LLMs might process poisoned content retrieved from the Web that contains malicious prompts pre-injected and selected by adversaries. We demonstrate that an attacker can indirectly perform such PI attacks. Based on this key insight, we systematically analyze the resulting threat landscape of Application-Integrated LLMs and discuss a variety of new attack vectors. To demonstrate the practical viability of our attacks, we implemented specific demonstrations of the proposed attacks within synthetic applications. In summary, our work calls for an urgent evaluation of current mitigation techniques and an investigation of whether new techniques are needed to defend LLMs against these threats.","created":"2023-02-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12173v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Controlled and Conditional Text to Image Generation with Diffusion Prior","abstract":"Denoising Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in generating diverse, high quality images from text. Numerous techniques have been proposed on top of or in alignment with models like Stable Diffusion and Imagen that generate images directly from text. A lesser explored approach is DALLE-2's two step process comprising a Diffusion Prior that generates a CLIP image embedding from text and a Diffusion Decoder that generates an image from a CLIP image embedding. We explore the capabilities of the Diffusion Prior and the advantages of an intermediate CLIP representation. We observe that Diffusion Prior can be used in a memory and compute efficient way to constrain the generation to a specific domain without altering the larger Diffusion Decoder. Moreover, we show that the Diffusion Prior can be trained with additional conditional information such as color histogram to further control the generation. We show quantitatively and qualitatively that the proposed approaches perform better than prompt engineering for domain specific generation and existing baselines for color conditioned generation. We believe that our observations and results will instigate further research into the diffusion prior and uncover more of its capabilities.","created":"2023-02-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11710v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

Unprecedentedly, the GRB presented very-high-energy (VHE, energy above 0.1 TeV) gamma-ray emission with energy extending above 10 TeV, as reported by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We here demonstrate that the VHE and especially >10 TeV emission may originate from the internal hadronic dissipation of the GRB, without the need of invoking any exotic processes as suggested by some previous studies. We also discuss the constraints on the properties of the GRB ejecta from multiwavelength and multi-messenger observations, which favors a magnetically dominated GRB ejecta. The suggested Poynting-flux-dominated GRB ejecta in this work supports the Blandford & Znajek (BZ) mechanism as the possible central engine model of GRB.","created":"2023-02-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11111v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"A Prompt Pattern Catalog to Enhance Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT","abstract":"Prompt engineering is an increasingly important skill set needed to converse effectively with large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. Prompts are instructions given to an LLM to enforce rules, automate processes, and ensure specific qualities (and quantities) of generated output. Prompts are also a form of programming that can customize the outputs and interactions with an LLM. This paper describes a catalog of prompt engineering techniques presented in pattern form that have been applied to solve common problems when conversing with LLMs. Prompt patterns are a knowledge transfer method analogous to software patterns since they provide reusable solutions to common problems faced in a particular context, i.e., output generation and interaction when working with LLMs. This paper provides the following contributions to research on prompt engineering that apply LLMs to automate software development tasks. First, it provides a framework for documenting patterns for structuring prompts to solve a range of problems so that they can be adapted to different domains. Second, it presents a catalog of patterns that have been applied successfully to improve the outputs of LLM conversations. Third, it explains how prompts can be built from multiple patterns and illustrates prompt patterns that benefit from combination with other prompt patterns.","created":"2023-02-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11382v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Prompt Stealing Attacks Against Text-to-Image Generation Models","abstract":"Text-to-Image generation models have revolutionized the artwork design process and enabled anyone to create high-quality images by entering text descriptions called prompts. Creating a high-quality prompt that consists of a subject and several modifiers can be time-consuming and costly. In consequence, a trend of trading high-quality prompts on specialized marketplaces has emerged. In this paper, we propose a novel attack, namely prompt stealing attack, which aims to steal prompts from generated images by text-to-image generation models. Successful prompt stealing attacks direct violate the intellectual property and privacy of prompt engineers and also jeopardize the business model of prompt trading marketplaces. We first perform a large-scale analysis on a dataset collected by ourselves and show that a successful prompt stealing attack should consider a prompt's subject as well as its modifiers. We then propose the first learning-based prompt stealing attack, PromptStealer, and demonstrate its superiority over two baseline methods quantitatively and qualitatively. We also make some initial attempts to defend PromptStealer. In general, our study uncovers a new attack surface in the ecosystem created by the popular text-to-image generation models. We hope our results can help to mitigate the threat.

However, of the thousands observed so far, still only a few have data at optical wavelengths in the first minutes after the onset of the prompt emission. Here we report on GRB\\,190106A, whose afterglow was observed in optical bands just 36 s after the {\\em Swift}/BAT trigger, i.e., during the prompt emission phase. The early optical afterglow exhibits a bimodal structure followed by a normal decay, with a faster decay after $\\sim \\rm T_{0}+$1 day. We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of GRB\\,190106A. We derive the redshift via metal absorption lines from Xinglong 2.16-m/BFOSC spectroscopic observations. From the BFOSC spectrum, we measure $z= 1.861\\pm0.002$. The double-peak optical light curve is a significant feature predicted by the reverse-forward external shock model. The shallow decay followed by a normal decay in both the X-ray and optical light curves is well explained with the standard forward-shock model with late-time energy injection.

{"title":"Few-shot Multimodal Multitask Multilingual Learning","abstract":"While few-shot learning as a transfer learning paradigm has gained significant traction for scenarios with limited data, it has primarily been explored in the context of building unimodal and unilingual models. Furthermore, a significant part of the existing literature in the domain of few-shot multitask learning perform in-context learning which requires manually generated prompts as the input, yielding varying outcomes depending on the level of manual prompt-engineering. In addition, in-context learning suffers from substantial computational, memory, and storage costs which eventually leads to high inference latency because it involves running all of the prompt's examples through the model every time a prediction is made. In contrast, methods based on the transfer learning via the fine-tuning paradigm avoid the aforementioned issues at a one-time cost of fine-tuning weights on a per-task basis. However, such methods lack exposure to few-shot multimodal multitask learning. In this paper, we propose few-shot learning for a multimodal multitask multilingual (FM3) setting by adapting pre-trained vision and language models using task-specific hypernetworks and contrastively fine-tuning them to enable few-shot learning. FM3's architecture combines the best of both worlds of in-context and fine-tuning based learning and consists of three major components: (i) multimodal contrastive fine-tuning to enable few-shot learning, (ii) hypernetwork task adaptation to perform multitask learning, and (iii) task-specific output heads to cater to a plethora of diverse tasks. FM3 learns the most prominent tasks in the vision and language domains along with their intersections, namely visual entailment (VE), visual question answering (VQA), and natural language understanding (NLU) tasks such as neural entity recognition (NER) and the GLUE benchmark including QNLI, MNLI, QQP, and SST-2.","created":"2023-02-19","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12489v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

In particular, refinement of the text input with the objective of achieving better results - commonly called prompt engineering - so far seems to have not been geared towards work with pre-existing texts. We investigate whether text-to-image generation and prompt engineering could be used to generate basic illustrations of popular fairytales. Using Midjourney v4, we engage in action research with a dual aim: to attempt to generate 5 believable illustrations for each of 5 popular fairytales, and to define a prompt engineering process that starts from a pre-existing text and arrives at an illustration of it. We arrive at a tentative 4-stage process: i) initial prompt, ii) composition adjustment, iii) style refinement, and iv) variation selection. We also discuss three reasons why the generation model struggles with certain illustrations: difficulties with counts, bias from stereotypical configurations and inability to depict overly fantastic situations. Our findings are not limited to the specific generation model and are intended to be generalisable to future ones.","created":"2023-02-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08961v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Learning Performance-Improving Code Edits","abstract":"The waning of Moore's Law has shifted the focus of the tech industry towards alternative methods for continued performance gains. While optimizing compilers are a standard tool to help increase program efficiency, programmers continue to shoulder much responsibility in crafting and refactoring code with better performance characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to suggest functionally correct, performance improving code edits. We hypothesize that language models can suggest such edits in ways that would be impractical for static analysis alone. We investigate these questions by curating a large-scale dataset of Performance-Improving Edits, PIE. PIE contains trajectories of programs, where a programmer begins with an initial, slower version and iteratively makes changes to improve the program's performance. We use PIE to evaluate and improve the capacity of large language models. Specifically, use examples from PIE to fine-tune multiple variants of CODEGEN, a billion-scale Transformer-decoder model. Additionally, we use examples from PIE to prompt OpenAI's CODEX using a few-shot prompting. By leveraging PIE, we find that both CODEX and CODEGEN can generate performance-improving edits, with speedups of more than 2.5x for over 25% of the programs, for C++ and Python, even after the C++ programs were compiled using the O3 optimization level. Crucially, we show that PIE allows CODEGEN, an open-sourced and 10x smaller model than CODEX, to match the performance of CODEX on this challenging task. Overall, this work opens new doors for creating systems and methods that can help programmers write efficient code.","created":"2023-02-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07867v3","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Log Parsing with Prompt-based Few-shot Learning","abstract":"Logs generated by large-scale software systems provide crucial information for engineers to understand the system status and diagnose problems of the systems. Log parsing, which converts raw log messages into structured data, is the first step to enabling automated log analytics. Existing log parsers extract the common part as log templates using statistical features. However, these log parsers often fail to identify the correct templates and parameters because: 1) they often overlook the semantic meaning of log messages, and 2) they require domain-specific knowledge for different log datasets. To address the limitations of existing methods, in this paper, we propose LogPPT to capture the patterns of templates using prompt-based few-shot learning. LogPPT utilises a novel prompt tuning method to recognise keywords and parameters based on a few labelled log data. In addition, an adaptive random sampling algorithm is designed to select a small yet diverse training set. We have conducted extensive experiments on 16 public log datasets. The experimental results show that LogPPT is effective and efficient for log parsing.","created":"2023-02-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07435v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Heterogeneous Anomaly Detection for Software Systems via Semi-supervised Cross-modal Attention","abstract":"Prompt and accurate detection of system anomalies is essential to ensure the reliability of software systems. Unlike manual efforts that exploit all available run-time information, existing approaches usually leverage only a single type of monitoring data (often logs or metrics) or fail to make effective use of the joint information among different types of data. Consequently, many false predictions occur. To better understand the manifestations of system anomalies, we conduct a systematical study on a large amount of heterogeneous data, i.e., logs and metrics. Our study demonstrates that logs and metrics can manifest system anomalies collaboratively and complementarily, and neither of them only is sufficient. Thus, integrating heterogeneous data can help recover the complete picture of a system's health status. In this context, we propose Hades, the first end-to-end semi-supervised approach to effectively identify system anomalies based on heterogeneous data. Our approach employs a hierarchical architecture to learn a global representation of the system status by fusing log semantics and metric patterns. It captures discriminative features and meaningful interactions from heterogeneous data via a cross-modal attention module, trained in a semi-supervised manner. We evaluate Hades extensively on large-scale simulated data and datasets from Huawei Cloud. The experimental results present the effectiveness of our model in detecting system anomalies.

TestPilot uses Codex, an off-the-shelf LLM, to automatically generate unit tests for a given program without requiring additional training or few-shot learning on examples of existing tests. In our approach, Codex is provided with prompts that include the signature and implementation of a function under test, along with usage examples extracted from documentation. If a generated test fails, TestPilot's adaptive component attempts to generate a new test that fixes the problem by re-prompting the model with the failing test and error message. We created an implementation of TestPilot for JavaScript and evaluated it on 25 npm packages with a total of 1,684 API functions to generate tests for. Our results show that the generated tests achieve up to 93.1% statement coverage (median 68.2%). Moreover, on average, 58.5% of the generated tests contain at least one assertion that exercises functionality from the package under test.

However, these zero-shot classifiers need prompt engineering to achieve high accuracy. Prompt engineering typically requires hand-crafting a set of prompts for individual downstream tasks. In this work, we aim to automate this prompt engineering and improve zero-shot accuracy through prompt ensembling. In particular, we ask \"Given a large pool of prompts, can we automatically score the prompts and ensemble those that are most suitable for a particular downstream dataset, without needing access to labeled validation data?\". We demonstrate that this is possible. In doing so, we identify several pathologies in a naive prompt scoring method where the score can be easily overconfident due to biases in pre-training and test data, and we propose a novel prompt scoring method that corrects for the biases. Using our proposed scoring method to create a weighted average prompt ensemble, our method outperforms equal average ensemble, as well as hand-crafted prompts, on ImageNet, 4 of its variants, and 11 fine-grained classification benchmarks, all while being fully automatic, optimization-free, and not requiring access to labeled validation data.","created":"2023-02-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06235v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

Here, we reported a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the TeV-emitting bright GRB 190114C. Its high fluence ($\\sim$ 4.436$\\times$10$^{-4}$ erg cm$^{-2}$) allows us to conduct the time-resolved spectral analysis in great detail and study their variations down to a very short time-scale ($\\sim$0.1 s) while preserving a high significance. Its prompt emission consists of three well-separated pulses. The first two main pulses ($P_1$ and $P_2$) exhibit independently strong thermal components, and starting from the third pulse ($P_3$) and extending to the entire afterglow, the spectra are all non-thermal, the synchrotron plus Compton up-scattering model well interpret the observation. By combining the thermal ($P_1$ and $P_2$) and the non-thermal ($P_3$) observations based on two different scenarios (global and pulse properties) and following the method described in \\cite{Zhang2021}, we measure the fireball parameters and GRB radiative efficiency with little uncertainties for this GRB. A relevantly high GRB radiative efficiency is obtained based on both the global and pulse properties, suggesting that if GRBs are powered by fireballs, the efficiency can be high sometimes. More interestingly, though the observed parameters are individually different (e.g., the amount of mass loading $M$), the radiative efficiency obtained from $P_1$ ($\\eta_\\gamma=36.0\\pm6.5\\%$) and $P_2$ ($\\eta_\\gamma=41.1\\pm1.9\\%$) is roughly the same, which implies that the central engine of the same GRB has some common properties.","created":"2023-02-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06116v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

We carry out an extensive technical evaluation of ChatGPT using 23 data sets covering 8 different common NLP application tasks. We evaluate the multitask, multilingual and multi-modal aspects of ChatGPT based on these data sets and a newly designed multimodal dataset. We find that ChatGPT outperforms LLMs with zero-shot learning on most tasks and even outperforms fine-tuned models on some tasks. We find that it is better at understanding non-Latin script languages than generating them. It is able to generate multimodal content from textual prompts, via an intermediate code generation step. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT is 63.41% accurate on average in 10 different reasoning categories under logical reasoning, non-textual reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, hence making it an unreliable reasoner. It is, for example, better at deductive than inductive reasoning. ChatGPT suffers from hallucination problems like other LLMs and it generates more extrinsic hallucinations from its parametric memory as it does not have access to an external knowledge base. Finally, the interactive feature of ChatGPT enables human collaboration with the underlying LLM to improve its performance, i.e, 8% ROUGE-1 on summarization and 2% ChrF++ on machine translation, in a multi-turn \"prompt engineering\" fashion.

More recently, we have seen the advent of general purpose \"large language models\", based on neural transformer architectures, that have been trained on massive datasets of human written text spanning code and natural language. However, despite the demonstrated representational power of such models, interacting with them has historically been constrained to specific task settings, limiting their general applicability. Many of these limitations were recently overcome with the introduction of ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI and trained to operate as a conversational agent, enabling it to answer questions and respond to a wide variety of commands from end users. The introduction of models, such as ChatGPT, has already spurred fervent discussion from educators, ranging from fear that students could use these AI tools to circumvent learning, to excitement about the new types of learning opportunities that they might unlock. However, given the nascent nature of these tools, we currently lack fundamental knowledge related to how well they perform in different educational settings, and the potential promise (or danger) that they might pose to traditional forms of instruction. As such, in this paper, we examine how well ChatGPT performs when tasked with answering common questions in a popular software testing curriculum. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT can provide correct or partially correct answers in 55.6% of cases, provide correct or partially correct explanations of answers in 53.0% of cases, and that prompting the tool in a shared question context leads to a marginally higher rate of correct responses.

However, there has been little focus on improving the richness of the class names themselves, which can pose issues when class labels are coarsely-defined and uninformative. We propose Classification with Hierarchical Label Sets (or CHiLS), an alternative strategy for zero-shot classification specifically designed for datasets with implicit semantic hierarchies. CHiLS proceeds in three steps: (i) for each class, produce a set of subclasses, using either existing label hierarchies or by querying GPT-3; (ii) perform the standard zero-shot CLIP procedure as though these subclasses were the labels of interest; (iii) map the predicted subclass back to its parent to produce the final prediction. Across numerous datasets with underlying hierarchical structure, CHiLS leads to improved accuracy in situations both with and without ground-truth hierarchical information.

Research in Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) has contributed towards the development of such techniques. However, the implementation of workable NLIs has always been challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, as well as in consequence of unclear and poorly written user queries which pose problems for existing language models in discerning user intent. Instead of pursuing the usual path of developing new iterations of language models, this study uniquely proposes leveraging the advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 to convert free-form natural language directly into code for appropriate visualisations. This paper presents a novel system, Chat2VIS, which takes advantage of the capabilities of LLMs and demonstrates how, with effective prompt engineering, the complex problem of language understanding can be solved more efficiently, resulting in simpler and more accurate end-to-end solutions than prior approaches. Chat2VIS shows that LLMs together with the proposed prompts offer a reliable approach to rendering visualisations from natural language queries, even when queries are highly misspecified and underspecified. This solution also presents a significant reduction in costs for the development of NLI systems, while attaining greater visualisation inference abilities compared to traditional NLP approaches that use hand-crafted grammar rules and tailored models. This study also presents how LLM prompts can be constructed in a way that preserves data security and privacy while being generalisable to different datasets.

These results show that LLMs can repair hardware security bugs and the framework is an important step towards the ultimate goal of an automated end-to-end bug repair framework.","created":"2023-02-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01215v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Trash to Treasure: Using text-to-image models to inform the design of physical artefacts","abstract":"Text-to-image generative models have recently exploded in popularity and accessibility. Yet so far, use of these models in creative tasks that bridge the 2D digital world and the creation of physical artefacts has been understudied. We conduct a pilot study to investigate if and how text-to-image models can be used to assist in upstream tasks within the creative process, such as ideation and visualization, prior to a sculpture-making activity. Thirty participants selected sculpture-making materials and generated three images using the Stable Diffusion text-to-image generator, each with text prompts of their choice, with the aim of informing and then creating a physical sculpture. The majority of participants (23/30) reported that the generated images informed their sculptures, and 28/30 reported interest in using text-to-image models to help them in a creative task in the future. We identify several prompt engineering strategies and find that a participant's prompting strategy relates to their stage in the creative process. We discuss how our findings can inform support for users at different stages of the design process and for using text-to-image models for physical artefact design.","created":"2023-02-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00561v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Conversational Automated Program Repair","abstract":"Automated Program Repair (APR) can help developers automatically generate patches for bugs. Due to the impressive performance obtained using Large Pre-Trained Language Models (LLMs) on many code related tasks, researchers have started to directly use LLMs for APR. However, prior approaches simply repeatedly sample the LLM given the same constructed input/prompt created from the original buggy code, which not only leads to generating the same incorrect patches repeatedly but also miss the critical information in testcases. To address these limitations, we propose conversational APR, a new paradigm for program repair that alternates between patch generation and validation in a conversational manner. In conversational APR, we iteratively build the input to the model by combining previously generated patches with validation feedback. As such, we leverage the long-term context window of LLMs to not only avoid generating previously incorrect patches but also incorporate validation feedback to help the model understand the semantic meaning of the program under test. We evaluate 10 different LLM including the newly developed ChatGPT model to demonstrate the improvement of conversational APR over the prior LLM for APR approach.","created":"2023-01-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13246v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Distilling Internet-Scale Vision-Language Models into Embodied Agents","abstract":"Instruction-following agents must ground language into their observation and action spaces. Learning to ground language is challenging, typically requiring domain-specific engineering or large quantities of human interaction data. To address this challenge, we propose using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to supervise embodied agents. We combine ideas from model distillation and hindsight experience replay (HER), using a VLM to retroactively generate language describing the agent's behavior. Simple prompting allows us to control the supervision signal, teaching an agent to interact with novel objects based on their names (e.g., planes) or their features (e.g., colors) in a 3D rendered environment. Fewshot prompting lets us teach abstract category membership, including pre-existing categories (food vs toys) and ad-hoc ones (arbitrary preferences over objects). Our work outlines a new and effective way to use internet-scale VLMs, repurposing the generic language grounding acquired by such models to teach task-relevant groundings to embodied agents.","created":"2023-01-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12507v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

By contrast, inaccurate representations can negatively affect viewers and lead to harmful perceptions of other cultures. To achieve inclusive representation in generated images, we propose a culturally-aware priming approach for text-to-image synthesis using a small but culturally curated dataset that we collected, known here as Cross-Cultural Understanding Benchmark (CCUB) Dataset, to fight the bias prevalent in giant datasets. Our proposed approach is comprised of two fine-tuning techniques: (1) Adding visual context via fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image synthesis model, Stable Diffusion, on the CCUB text-image pairs, and (2) Adding semantic context via automated prompt engineering using the fine-tuned large language model, GPT-3, trained on our CCUB culturally-aware text data. CCUB dataset is curated and our approach is evaluated by people who have a personal relationship with that particular culture. Our experiments indicate that priming using both text and image is effective in improving the cultural relevance and decreasing the offensiveness of generated images while maintaining quality.","created":"2023-01-28","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12073v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"User-Customizable Transpilation of Scripting Languages","abstract":"A transpiler converts code from one programming language to another. Many practical uses of transpilers require the user to be able to guide or customize the program produced from a given input program. This customizability is important for satisfying many application-specific goals for the produced code such as ensuring performance, readability, maintainability, compatibility, and so on. Conventional transpilers are deterministic rule-driven systems often written without offering customizability per user and per program. Recent advances in transpilers based on neural networks offer some customizability to users, e.g. through interactive prompts, but they are still difficult to precisely control the production of a desired output. Both conventional and neural transpilation also suffer from the \"last mile\" problem: they produce correct code on average, i.e., on most parts of a given program, but not necessarily for all parts of it. We propose a new transpilation approach that offers fine-grained customizability and reusability of transpilation rules created by others, without burdening the user to understand the global semantics of the given source program. Our approach is mostly automatic and incremental, i.e., constructs translation rules needed to transpile the given program as per the user's guidance piece-by-piece. We implement the transpiler as a tool called DuoGlot, which translates Python to Javascript programs, and evaluate it on the popular GeeksForGeeks benchmarks. DuoGlot achieves 90% translation accuracy and so it outperforms all existing translators, while it produces readable code. We evaluate DuoGlot on two additional benchmarks, containing more challenging and longer programs, and similarly observe improved accuracy.","created":"2023-01-26","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11220v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

We adopt the prompts advised by ChatGPT to trigger its translation ability and find that the candidate prompts generally work well and show minor performance differences. By evaluating on a number of benchmark test sets, we find that ChatGPT performs competitively with commercial translation products (e.g., Google Translate) on high-resource European languages but lags behind significantly on low-resource or distant languages. For distant languages, we explore an interesting strategy named $\\mathbf{pivot~prompting}$ that asks ChatGPT to translate the source sentence into a high-resource pivot language before into the target language, which improves the translation performance significantly. As for the translation robustness, ChatGPT does not perform as well as the commercial systems on biomedical abstracts or Reddit comments but exhibits good results on spoken language. With the launch of the GPT-4 engine, the translation performance of ChatGPT is significantly boosted, becoming comparable to commercial translation products, even for distant languages.

However, existing approaches are rule-based and sequence-labeling based. They must manually enumerate the rules or label data for a wide range of sentence patterns, which involves a significant amount of labor overhead and is exacerbated by morphological and common-word ambiguity. In contrast to matching or labeling API entities and relations, this paper formulates heterogeneous API extraction and API relation extraction task as a sequence-to-sequence generation task, and proposes AERJE, an API entity-relation joint extraction model based on the large pre-trained language model. After training on a small number of ambiguous but correctly labeled data, AERJE builds a multi-task architecture that extracts API entities and relations from unstructured text using dynamic prompts. We systematically evaluate AERJE on a set of long and ambiguous sentences from Stack Overflow. The experimental results show that AERJE achieves high accuracy and discrimination ability in API entity-relation joint extraction, even with zero or few-shot fine-tuning.","created":"2023-01-10","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03987v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

Neural computational principles inspire new intelligent machines, which are in turn used to advance theoretical understanding of the brain. To promote further exchange of ideas and collaboration between biological and artificial intelligence researchers, we introduce the 2023 installment of the Algonauts Project challenge: How the Human Brain Makes Sense of Natural Scenes (http://algonauts.csail.mit.edu). This installment prompts the fields of artificial and biological intelligence to come together towards building computational models of the visual brain using the largest and richest dataset of fMRI responses to visual scenes, the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD). NSD provides high-quality fMRI responses to ~73,000 different naturalistic colored scenes, making it the ideal candidate for data-driven model building approaches promoted by the 2023 challenge. The challenge is open to all and makes results directly comparable and transparent through a public leaderboard automatically updated after each submission, thus allowing for rapid model development. We believe that the 2023 installment will spark symbiotic collaborations between biological and artificial intelligence scientists, leading to a deeper understanding of the brain through cutting-edge computational models and to novel ways of engineering artificial intelligent agents through inductive biases from biological systems.","created":"2023-01-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03198v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"GRB minimum variability timescale with Insight-HXMT and Swift: implications for progenitor models, dissipation physics and GRB classifications","abstract":"The dissipation process of GRB prompt emission is still unknown. Study of temporal variability may provide a unique way to discriminate the imprint of the inner engine activity from geometry and propagation related effects. We define the minimum variability timescale (MVT) as the shortest duration of individual pulses that shape a light curve for a sample of GRBs and test correlations with peak luminosity, Lorentz factor, and jet opening angle. We compare these correlations with predictions from recent numerical simulations for a relativistic structured -- possibly wobbling -- jet and assess the value of MTV as probe of prompt-emission physics. We used the peak detection algorithm mepsa to identify the shortest pulse within a GRB time history and estimate its full width half maximum (FWHM). We applied this framework to two sets of GRBs: Swift (from 2005 to July 2022) and Insight-HXMT (from June 2017 to July 2021, including 221009A). We then selected 401 GRBs with measured z to test for correlations. On average short GRBs have significantly shorter MVT than long GRBs. The MVT distribution of short GRBs with extended emission such as 060614 and 211211A is compatible only with that of short GRBs. This provides a new clue on the progenitor's nature. The MVT for long GRBs anticorrelates with peak luminosity. We confirm the anticorrelation with the Lorentz factor and find a correlation with the jet opening angle as estimated from the afterglow, along with an inverse correlation with the number of pulses. The MVT can identify the emerging putative new class of long GRBs that are suggested to be produced by compact binary mergers. For otherwise typical long GRBs, the different correlations between MVT and peak luminosity, Lorentz factor, jet opening angle, and number of pulses can be explained within the context of structured, possibly wobbling, weakly magnetised relativistic jets.

{"title":"GPT Takes the Bar Exam","abstract":"Nearly all jurisdictions in the United States require a professional license exam, commonly referred to as \"the Bar Exam,\" as a precondition for law practice. To even sit for the exam, most jurisdictions require that an applicant completes at least seven years of post-secondary education, including three years at an accredited law school. In addition, most test-takers also undergo weeks to months of further, exam-specific preparation. Despite this significant investment of time and capital, approximately one in five test-takers still score under the rate required to pass the exam on their first try. In the face of a complex task that requires such depth of knowledge, what, then, should we expect of the state of the art in \"AI?\" In this research, we document our experimental evaluation of the performance of OpenAI's `text-davinci-003` model, often-referred to as GPT-3.5, on the multistate multiple choice (MBE) section of the exam. While we find no benefit in fine-tuning over GPT-3.5's zero-shot performance at the scale of our training data, we do find that hyperparameter optimization and prompt engineering positively impacted GPT-3.5's zero-shot performance. For best prompt and parameters, GPT-3.5 achieves a headline correct rate of 50.3% on a complete NCBE MBE practice exam, significantly in excess of the 25% baseline guessing rate, and performs at a passing rate for both Evidence and Torts. GPT-3.5's ranking of responses is also highly-correlated with correctness; its top two and top three choices are correct 71% and 88% of the time, respectively, indicating very strong non-entailment performance. While our ability to interpret these results is limited by nascent scientific understanding of LLMs and the proprietary nature of GPT, we believe that these results strongly suggest that an LLM will pass the MBE component of the Bar Exam in the near future.","created":"2022-12-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14402v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

We ask, can these powerful software devices be purposed to produce engaging captions for generic data visualizations like a scatterplot.

{"title":"Connecting the early afterglow to the prompt GRB and the central engine in the striped jet model","abstract":"Despite a generally accepted framework for describing the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) afterglows, the nature of the compact object at the central engine and the mechanism behind the prompt emission remain debated. The striped jet model is a promising venue to connect the various GRB stages since it gives a robust prediction for the relation of jet bulk acceleration, magnetization and dissipation profile as a function of distance. Here, we use the constraints of the magnetization and bulk Lorentz of the jet flow at the large scales where the jet starts interacting with the ambient gas in a large sample of bursts to (i) test the striped jet model for the GRB flow and (ii) study its predictions for the prompt emission and the constraints on the nature of the central engine. We find that the peak of the photospheric component of the emission predicted by the model is in agreement with the observed prompt emission spectra in the majority of the bursts in our sample, with a radiative efficiency of about 10 per cent. Furthermore, we adopt two different approaches to correlate the peak energies of the bursts with the type of central engine to find that more bursts are compatible with a neutron star central engine compared to a black hole one. Lastly, we conclude that the model favors broader distribution of stripe length-scales which results in a more gradual dissipation profile in comparison to the case where the jet stripes are characterized by a single length-scale.","created":"2022-12-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11406v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

In this work, we capitalize on state-of-the-art Code-LLMs, such as Codex, to bootstrap the use of symbolic methods for tracking the state of stories and aiding in story understanding.

To address this, we introduce a new framework called DISCO for automatically generating high-quality counterfactual data at scale. DISCO engineers prompts to generate phrasal perturbations with a large general language model. Then, a task-specific teacher model filters the generation to distill high-quality counterfactual data. We show that learning with this counterfactual data yields a comparatively small student model that is 6% (absolute) more robust and generalizes 5% better across distributions than baselines on various challenging evaluations.

However, they tend to be brittle as slight edits to a prompt could lead to very different generations; these robustness properties, critical for user experience when deployed in real-life applications, are not well understood. Most existing works on robustness in text or code tasks have focused on classification, while robustness in generation tasks is an uncharted area and to date there is no comprehensive benchmark for robustness in code generation. In this paper, we propose ReCode, a comprehensive robustness evaluation benchmark for code generation models. We customize over 30 transformations specifically for code on docstrings, function and variable names, code syntax, and code format. They are carefully designed to be natural in real-life coding practice, preserve the original semantic meaning, and thus provide multifaceted assessments of a model's robustness performance. With human annotators, we verified that over 90% of the perturbed prompts do not alter the semantic meaning of the original prompt. In addition, we define robustness metrics for code generation models considering the worst-case behavior under each type of perturbation, taking advantage of the fact that executing the generated code can serve as objective evaluation. We demonstrate ReCode on SOTA models using HumanEval, MBPP, as well as function completion tasks derived from them. Interesting observations include: better robustness for CodeGen over InCoder and GPT-J; models are most sensitive to syntax perturbations; more challenging robustness evaluation on MBPP over HumanEval.","created":"2022-12-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10264v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

X-ray flares can therefore provide important clues to understanding the nature of the central engines of GRBs. In this work, we study for the first time the physical connection between differential size and return distributions of X-ray flares of GRBs with known redshifts. We find that the differential distributions of duration, energy, and waiting time can be well fitted by a power-law function. In particular, the distributions for the differences of durations, energies, and waiting times at different times (i.e., the return distributions) well follow a $q$-Gaussian form. The $q$ values in the $q$-Gaussian distributions remain nearly steady for different temporal interval scales, implying a scale-invariant structure of GRB X-ray flares. Moreover, we verify that the $q$ parameters are related to the power-law indices $\\alpha$ of the differential size distributions, characterized as $q=(\\alpha+2)/\\alpha$.

Finally, we envision how active learning may help to guide the retrieval of generated images.","created":"2022-12-14","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07476v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Evidence of high latitude emission in the prompt phase of GRBs: How far from the central engine are the GRBs produced?","abstract":"The physical mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains elusive. One of the difficulties in nailing down their physical mechanism comes from the fact that there has been no clear observational evidence on how far from the central engine the prompt gamma-rays of GRBs are emitted while the competing physical mechanisms predict different characteristic distances. Here we present a simple study addressing this question by making use of the \"high-latitude emission\" (HLE). We show that our detailed numerical modeling exhibits a clear signature of HLE in the decaying phase of \"broad pulses\" of GRBs. We show that the HLE can emerge as a prominent spectral break in $F_{\\nu}$ spectra and dominate the peak of $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ spectra even while the \"line-of-sight emission\" (LoSE) is still ongoing, hence providing a new view of HLE emergence. We remark that this \"HLE break\" could be hidden in some broad pulses, depending on the proximity between the peak energies of the LoSE and the HLE. Also, we present three examples of Fermi-GBM GRBs with broad pulses that exhibit the HLE signature. We show that their gamma-ray emitting region should be located at $\\sim 10^{16}$ cm from the central engine, which disfavors the photosphere models and small-radii internal shock models but favors magnetic dissipation models with a large emission radius.","created":"2022-12-14","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07094v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"ERNIE-Code: Beyond English-Centric Cross-lingual Pretraining for Programming Languages","abstract":"Software engineers working with the same programming language (PL) may speak different natural languages (NLs) and vice versa, erecting huge barriers to communication and working efficiency. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of generative pre-training in computer programs, yet they are always English-centric. In this work, we step towards bridging the gap between multilingual NLs and multilingual PLs for large language models (LLMs). We release ERNIE-Code, a unified pre-trained language model for 116 NLs and 6 PLs. We employ two methods for universal cross-lingual pre-training: span-corruption language modeling that learns patterns from monolingual NL or PL; and pivot-based translation language modeling that relies on parallel data of many NLs and PLs. Extensive results show that ERNIE-Code outperforms previous multilingual LLMs for PL or NL across a wide range of end tasks of code intelligence, including multilingual code-to-text, text-to-code, code-to-code, and text-to-text generation. We further show its advantage of zero-shot prompting on multilingual code summarization and text-to-text translation. We will make our code and pre-trained models publicly available.","created":"2022-12-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06742v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"Fill in the Blank: Context-aware Automated Text Input Generation for Mobile GUI Testing","abstract":"Automated GUI testing is widely used to help ensure the quality of mobile apps. However, many GUIs require appropriate text inputs to proceed to the next page which remains a prominent obstacle for testing coverage. Considering the diversity and semantic requirement of valid inputs (e.g., flight departure, movie name), it is challenging to automate the text input generation. Inspired by the fact that the pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) has made outstanding progress in text generation, we propose an approach named QTypist based on LLM for intelligently generating semantic input text according to the GUI context. To boost the performance of LLM in the mobile testing scenario, we develop a prompt-based data construction and tuning method which automatically extracts the prompts and answers for model tuning. We evaluate QTypist on 106 apps from Google Play and the result shows that the passing rate of QTypist is 87%, which is 93% higher than the best baseline. We also integrate QTypist with the automated GUI testing tools and it can cover 42% more app activities, 52% more pages, and subsequently help reveal 122% more bugs compared with the raw tool.","created":"2022-12-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04732v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"PromptonomyViT: Multi-Task Prompt Learning Improves Video Transformers using Synthetic Scene Data","abstract":"Action recognition models have achieved impressive results by incorporating scene-level annotations, such as objects, their relations, 3D structure, and more. However, obtaining annotations of scene structure for videos requires a significant amount of effort to gather and annotate, making these methods expensive to train. In contrast, synthetic datasets generated by graphics engines provide powerful alternatives for generating scene-level annotations across multiple tasks. In this work, we propose an approach to leverage synthetic scene data for improving video understanding. We present a multi-task prompt learning approach for video transformers, where a shared video transformer backbone is enhanced by a small set of specialized parameters for each task. Specifically, we add a set of ``task prompts'', each corresponding to a different task, and let each prompt predict task-related annotations. This design allows the model to capture information shared among synthetic scene tasks as well as information shared between synthetic scene tasks and a real video downstream task throughout the entire network. We refer to this approach as ``Promptonomy'', since the prompts model task-related structure. We propose the PromptonomyViT model (PViT), a video transformer that incorporates various types of scene-level information from synthetic data using the ``Promptonomy'' approach. PViT shows strong performance improvements on multiple video understanding tasks and datasets.","created":"2022-12-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04821v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

We investigate the performance of zero-shot LPE for given facts in case-texts from the European Court of Human Rights (in English) and the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland (in German, French and Italian). Our results show that zero-shot LPE is better compared to the baselines, but it still falls short compared to current state of the art supervised approaches. Nevertheless, the results are important, since there was 1) no explicit domain-specific data used - so we show that the transfer to the legal domain is possible for general-purpose LLMs, and 2) the LLMs where directly applied without any further training or fine-tuning - which in turn saves immensely in terms of additional computational costs.","created":"2022-12-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02199v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"Controllable Image Captioning via Prompting","abstract":"Despite the remarkable progress of image captioning, existing captioners typically lack the controllable capability to generate desired image captions, e.g., describing the image in a rough or detailed manner, in a factual or emotional view, etc. In this paper, we show that a unified model is qualified to perform well in diverse domains and freely switch among multiple styles. Such a controllable capability is achieved by embedding the prompt learning into the image captioning framework. To be specific, we design a set of prompts to fine-tune the pre-trained image captioner. These prompts allow the model to absorb stylized data from different domains for joint training, without performance degradation in each domain. Furthermore, we optimize the prompts with learnable vectors in the continuous word embedding space, avoiding the heuristic prompt engineering and meanwhile exhibiting superior performance. In the inference stage, our model is able to generate desired stylized captions by choosing the corresponding prompts. Extensive experiments verify the controllable capability of the proposed method. Notably, we achieve outstanding performance on two diverse image captioning benchmarks including COCO Karpathy split and TextCaps using a unified model.","created":"2022-12-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01803v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

We consider the time-dependent evolution of the outflow with its impact on the observed light curve from multiple collisions, and the self-consistent generation of the electromagnetic spectrum in synchrotron and inverse Compton-dominated scenarios. Our leptohadronic model includes UHE protons potentially accelerated in the outflow, and their feedback on spectral energy distribution and on the neutrino emission. We find that we can roughly reproduce the observed light curves with an engine with varying ejection velocity of ultra-relativistic material, which has an intermediate quiescent period of about 200 seconds and a variability timescale of $\\sim1$~s. We consider baryonic loadings of 3 and 30 that are compatible with the hypothesis that the highest-energetic LHAASO photons might come from UHECR interactions with the extragalactic background light, and the paradigm that energetic GRBs may power the UHECR flux. For these values and the high dissipation radii considered we find consistency with the non-observation of neutrinos and no significant signatures on the electromagnetic spectrum. Inverse Compton-dominated scenarios from the prompt emission are demonstrated to lead to about an order of magnitude higher fluxes in the HE-range; this enhancement is testable by its spectral impact in the Fermi-GBM and LAT ranges.","created":"2022-12-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00766v3","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

We perform an extensive study across six datasets with eight models from three model families. Experimental results show that Coder-Reviewer reranking leads to consistent and significant improvement (up to 17% absolute accuracy gain) over reranking with the Coder model only. When combined with executability filtering, Coder-Reviewer reranking can often outperform the minimum Bayes risk method.

Some solutions to map key points (short textual summaries capturing essential information and filtering redundancies) to a large number of arguments/opinions have been provided recently (Bar-Haim et al., 2020). To complement the full picture of the argument-to-keypoint mapping task, we mainly propose two approaches in this paper. The first approach is to incorporate prompt engineering for fine-tuning the pre-trained language models (PLMs). The second approach utilizes prompt-based learning in PLMs to generate intermediary texts, which are then combined with the original argument-keypoint pairs and fed as inputs to a classifier, thereby mapping them. Furthermore, we extend the experiments to cross/in-domain to conduct an in-depth analysis. In our evaluation, we find that i) using prompt engineering in a more direct way (Approach 1) can yield promising results and improve the performance; ii) Approach 2 performs considerably worse than Approach 1 due to the negation issue of the PLM.","created":"2022-11-28","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14995v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"A Prompt-based Few-shot Learning Approach to Software Conflict Detection","abstract":"A software requirement specification (SRS) document is an essential part of the software development life cycle which outlines the requirements that a software program in development must satisfy. This document is often specified by a diverse group of stakeholders and is subject to continual change, making the process of maintaining the document and detecting conflicts between requirements an essential task in software development. Notably, projects that do not address conflicts in the SRS document early on face considerable problems later in the development life cycle. These problems incur substantial costs in terms of time and money, and these costs often become insurmountable barriers that ultimately result in the termination of a software project altogether. As a result, early detection of SRS conflicts is critical to project sustainability. The conflict detection task is approached in numerous ways, many of which require a significant amount of manual intervention from developers, or require access to a large amount of labeled, task-specific training data. In this work, we propose using a prompt-based learning approach to perform few-shot learning for conflict detection. We compare our results to supervised learning approaches that use pretrained language models, such as BERT and its variants. Our results show that prompting with just 32 labeled examples can achieve a similar level of performance in many key metrics to that of supervised learning on training sets that are magnitudes larger in size. In contrast to many other conflict detection approaches, we make no assumptions about the type of underlying requirements, allowing us to analyze pairings of both functional and non-functional requirements. This allows us to omit the potentially expensive task of filtering out non-functional requirements from our dataset.","created":"2022-11-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02709v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Large Language Models Are Human-Level Prompt Engineers","abstract":"By conditioning on natural language instructions, large language models (LLMs) have displayed impressive capabilities as general-purpose computers. However, task performance depends significantly on the quality of the prompt used to steer the model, and most effective prompts have been handcrafted by humans. Inspired by classical program synthesis and the human approach to prompt engineering, we propose Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) for automatic instruction generation and selection. In our method, we treat the instruction as the \"program,\" optimized by searching over a pool of instruction candidates proposed by an LLM in order to maximize a chosen score function. To evaluate the quality of the selected instruction, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of another LLM following the selected instruction. Experiments on 24 NLP tasks show that our automatically generated instructions outperform the prior LLM baseline by a large margin and achieve better or comparable performance to the instructions generated by human annotators on 19/24 tasks. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the performance of APE.

However, most existing zero-shot methods involve heavy human engineering or complicated self-training pipelines, hindering their application to new situations. In this work, we show that zero-shot text classification can be improved simply by clustering texts in the embedding spaces of PLMs. Specifically, we fit the unlabeled texts with a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model after initializing cluster positions and shapes using class names. Despite its simplicity, this approach achieves superior or comparable performance on both topic and sentiment classification datasets and outperforms prior works significantly on unbalanced datasets. We further explore the applicability of our clustering approach by evaluating it on 14 datasets with more diverse topics, text lengths, and numbers of classes. Our approach achieves an average of 20% absolute improvement over prompt-based zero-shot learning. Finally, we compare different PLM embedding spaces and find that texts are well-clustered by topics even if the PLM is not explicitly pre-trained to generate meaningful sentence embeddings.

In a large fraction of the global traffic from customers using smart digital assistants, frictions in dialogues may be attributed to incorrect understanding of the entities in a customer's query due to factors including ambiguous mentions, mispronunciation, background noise and faulty on-device signal processing. Such errors are compounded by two common deficiencies from intelligent devices namely, (1) the device not being tailored to individual customers, and (2) the device responses being unaware of the context in the conversation session. Viewing this problem via the lens of retrieval-based search engines, we build and evaluate a scalable entity correction system, PENTATRON. The system leverages a parametric transformer-based language model to learn patterns from in-session customer-device interactions coupled with a non-parametric personalized entity index to compute the correct query, which aids downstream components in reasoning about the best response. In addition to establishing baselines and demonstrating the value of personalized and context-aware systems, we use multitasking to learn the domain of the correct entity.

Existing methods to control for story preference utilize prompt engineering which is labor intensive and often inconsistent.

To address these issues, we first train a contrastive bi-encoder model to align stories with corresponding human critiques, named CARP, building a general purpose preference model. This is subsequently used as a reward function to fine-tune a generative language model via reinforcement learning. However, simply fine-tuning a generative language model with a contrastive reward model does not always reliably result in a story generation system capable of generating stories that meet user preferences. To increase story generation robustness we further fine-tune the contrastive reward model using a prompt-learning technique. A human participant study is then conducted comparing generations from our full system, ablations, and two baselines. We show that the full fine-tuning pipeline results in a story generator preferred over a LLM 20x as large as well as logit-based methods.

In the GPT-3 family of models, as model size increases we show that the single-hop question answering performance improves faster than the multi-hop performance does, therefore the compositionality gap does not decrease. This surprising result suggests that while more powerful models memorize and recall more factual knowledge, they show no corresponding improvement in their ability to perform this kind of compositional reasoning.   We then demonstrate how elicitive prompting (such as chain of thought) narrows the compositionality gap by reasoning explicitly instead of implicitly. We present a new method, self-ask, that further improves on chain of thought. In our method, the model explicitly asks itself (and then answers) follow-up questions before answering the initial question. We finally show that self-ask's structured prompting lets us easily plug in a search engine to answer the follow-up questions, which additionally improves accuracy.","created":"2022-10-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03350v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Large Language Models are Pretty Good Zero-Shot Video Game Bug Detectors","abstract":"Video game testing requires game-specific knowledge as well as common sense reasoning about the events in the game. While AI-driven agents can satisfy the first requirement, it is not yet possible to meet the second requirement automatically. Therefore, video game testing often still relies on manual testing, and human testers are required to play the game thoroughly to detect bugs. As a result, it is challenging to fully automate game testing. In this study, we explore the possibility of leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of large language models for video game bug detection. By formulating the bug detection problem as a question-answering task, we show that large language models can identify which event is buggy in a sequence of textual descriptions of events from a game. To this end, we introduce the GameBugDescriptions benchmark dataset, which consists of 167 buggy gameplay videos and a total of 334 question-answer pairs across 8 games. We extensively evaluate the performance of six models across the OPT and InstructGPT large language model families on our benchmark dataset. Our results show promising results for employing language models to detect video game bugs. With the proper prompting technique, we could achieve an accuracy of 70.66%, and on some video games, up to 78.94%.

We detail the basic tools required, outline the general activity, and describe the modifications to the activity based on learners' ages and learning objectives.

{"title":"Repairing Bugs in Python Assignments Using Large Language Models","abstract":"Students often make mistakes on their introductory programming assignments as part of their learning process. Unfortunately, providing custom repairs for these mistakes can require a substantial amount of time and effort from class instructors. Automated program repair (APR) techniques can be used to synthesize such fixes. Prior work has explored the use of symbolic and neural techniques for APR in the education domain. Both types of approaches require either substantial engineering efforts or large amounts of data and training. We propose to use a large language model trained on code, such as Codex, to build an APR system -- MMAPR -- for introductory Python programming assignments. Our system can fix both syntactic and semantic mistakes by combining multi-modal prompts, iterative querying, test-case-based selection of few-shots, and program chunking. We evaluate MMAPR on 286 real student programs and compare to a baseline built by combining a state-of-the-art Python syntax repair engine, BIFI, and state-of-the-art Python semantic repair engine for student assignments, Refactory. We find that MMAPR can fix more programs and produce smaller patches on average.","created":"2022-09-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14876v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Prompt Emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts in the High-density Environment of Active Galactic Nuclei Accretion Disks","abstract":"Long and short gamma-ray bursts are traditionally associated with galactic environments, where circumburst densities are small or moderate (few to hundreds of protons per cubic cm). However, both are also expected to occur in the disks of Active Galactic Nuclei, where the ambient medium density can be much larger. In this work we study, via semi-analytical methods, the propagation of the GRB outflow, its interaction with the external material, and the ensuing prompt radiation. In particular, we focus on the case in which the external shock develops early in the evolution, at a radius that is smaller than the internal shock one. We find that bursts in such high density environments are likely characterized by a single, long emission episode that is due to the superposition of individual pulses, with a characteristic hard to soft evolution irrespective of the light curve luminosity. While multi-pulse light curves are not impossible, they would require the central engine to go dormant for a long time before re-igniting. In addition, short GRB engines would produce bursts with prompt duration that would exceed the canonical 2 s separation threshold and would likely be incorrectly classified as long events, even though they would not be accompanied by a simultaneous supernova. Finally, these events have a large dynamical efficiency which would produce a bright prompt emission followed by a somewhat dim afterglow.","created":"2022-09-28","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14308v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Promptagator: Few-shot Dense Retrieval From 8 Examples","abstract":"Much recent research on information retrieval has focused on how to transfer from one task (typically with abundant supervised data) to various other tasks where supervision is limited, with the implicit assumption that it is possible to generalize from one task to all the rest. However, this overlooks the fact that there are many diverse and unique retrieval tasks, each targeting different search intents, queries, and search domains. In this paper, we suggest to work on Few-shot Dense Retrieval, a setting where each task comes with a short description and a few examples. To amplify the power of a few examples, we propose Prompt-base Query Generation for Retriever (Promptagator), which leverages large language models (LLM) as a few-shot query generator, and creates task-specific retrievers based on the generated data. Powered by LLM's generalization ability, Promptagator makes it possible to create task-specific end-to-end retrievers solely based on a few examples {without} using Natural Questions or MS MARCO to train %question generators or dual encoders. Surprisingly, LLM prompting with no more than 8 examples allows dual encoders to outperform heavily engineered models trained on MS MARCO like ColBERT v2 by more than 1.2 nDCG on average on 11 retrieval sets. Further training standard-size re-rankers using the same generated data yields another 5.0 point nDCG improvement. Our studies determine that query generation can be far more effective than previously observed, especially when a small amount of task-specific knowledge is given.","created":"2022-09-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11755v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Unsupervised Hashing with Semantic Concept Mining","abstract":"Recently, to improve the unsupervised image retrieval performance, plenty of unsupervised hashing methods have been proposed by designing a semantic similarity matrix, which is based on the similarities between image features extracted by a pre-trained CNN model. However, most of these methods tend to ignore high-level abstract semantic concepts contained in images. Intuitively, concepts play an important role in calculating the similarity among images. In real-world scenarios, each image is associated with some concepts, and the similarity between two images will be larger if they share more identical concepts. Inspired by the above intuition, in this work, we propose a novel Unsupervised Hashing with Semantic Concept Mining, called UHSCM, which leverages a VLP model to construct a high-quality similarity matrix. Specifically, a set of randomly chosen concepts is first collected. Then, by employing a vision-language pretraining (VLP) model with the prompt engineering which has shown strong power in visual representation learning, the set of concepts is denoised according to the training images. Next, the proposed method UHSCM applies the VLP model with prompting again to mine the concept distribution of each image and construct a high-quality semantic similarity matrix based on the mined concept distributions. Finally, with the semantic similarity matrix as guiding information, a novel hashing loss with a modified contrastive loss based regularization item is proposed to optimize the hashing network. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in the image retrieval task.","created":"2022-09-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11475v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"What does ChatGPT return about human values? Exploring value bias in ChatGPT using a descriptive value theory","abstract":"There has been concern about ideological basis and possible discrimination in text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). We test possible value biases in ChatGPT using a psychological value theory. We designed a simple experiment in which we used a number of different probes derived from the Schwartz basic value theory (items from the revised Portrait Value Questionnaire, the value type definitions, value names). We prompted ChatGPT via the OpenAI API repeatedly to generate text and then analyzed the generated corpus for value content with a theory-driven value dictionary using a bag of words approach. Overall, we found little evidence of explicit value bias. The results showed sufficient construct and discriminant validity for the generated text in line with the theoretical predictions of the psychological model, which suggests that the value content was carried through into the outputs with high fidelity. We saw some merging of socially oriented values, which may suggest that these values are less clearly differentiated at a linguistic level or alternatively, this mixing may reflect underlying universal human motivations. We outline some possible applications of our findings for both applications of ChatGPT for corporate usage and policy making as well as future research avenues. We also highlight possible implications of this relatively high-fidelity replication of motivational content using a linguistic model for the theorizing about human values.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03612v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"ChatPipe: Orchestrating Data Preparation Program by Optimizing Human-ChatGPT Interactions","abstract":"Orchestrating a high-quality data preparation program is essential for successful machine learning (ML), but it is known to be time and effort consuming. Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models like ChatGPT in generating programs by interacting with users through natural language prompts, there are still limitations. Specifically, a user must provide specific prompts to iteratively guide ChatGPT in improving data preparation programs, which requires a certain level of expertise in programming, the dataset used and the ML task. Moreover, once a program has been generated, it is non-trivial to revisit a previous version or make changes to the program without starting the process over again. In this paper, we present ChatPipe, a novel system designed to facilitate seamless interaction between users and ChatGPT. ChatPipe provides users with effective recommendation on next data preparation operations, and guides ChatGPT to generate program for the operations. Also, ChatPipe enables users to easily roll back to previous versions of the program, which facilitates more efficient experimentation and testing. We have developed a web application for ChatPipe and prepared several real-world ML tasks from Kaggle.

{"title":"Generative Recommendation: Towards Next-generation Recommender Paradigm","abstract":"Recommender systems typically retrieve items from an item corpus for personalized recommendations. However, such a retrieval-based recommender paradigm faces two limitations: 1) the human-generated items in the corpus might fail to satisfy the users' diverse information needs, and 2) users usually adjust the recommendations via passive and inefficient feedback such as clicks. Nowadays, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has revealed significant success across various domains, offering the potential to overcome these limitations: 1) generative AI can produce personalized items to meet users' specific information needs, and 2) the newly emerged ChatGPT significantly facilitates users to express information needs more precisely via natural language instructions. In this light, the boom of AIGC points the way towards the next-generation recommender paradigm with two new objectives: 1) generating personalized content through generative AI, and 2) integrating user instructions to guide content generation.   To this end, we propose a novel Generative Recommender paradigm named GeneRec, which adopts an AI generator to personalize content generation and leverages user instructions to acquire users' information needs. Specifically, we pre-process users' instructions and traditional feedback (e.g., clicks) via an instructor to output the generation guidance. Given the guidance, we instantiate the AI generator through an AI editor and an AI creator to repurpose existing items and create new items, respectively. Eventually, GeneRec can perform content retrieval, repurposing, and creation to meet users' information needs. Besides, to ensure the trustworthiness of the generated items, we emphasize various fidelity checks such as authenticity and legality checks. Lastly, we study the feasibility of implementing the AI editor and AI creator on micro-video generation, showing promising results.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03516v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

For example, by simply adding CoT instruction ``Let's think step-by-step'' to each input query of MultiArith dataset, GPT-3's accuracy can be improved from 17.7\\% to 78.7\\%. However, it is not clear whether CoT is still effective on more recent instruction finetuned (IFT) LLMs such as ChatGPT. Surprisingly, on ChatGPT, CoT is no longer effective for certain tasks such as arithmetic reasoning while still keeping effective on other reasoning tasks. Moreover, on the former tasks, ChatGPT usually achieves the best performance and can generate CoT even without being instructed to do so. Hence, it is plausible that ChatGPT has already been trained on these tasks with CoT and thus memorized the instruction so it implicitly follows such an instruction when applied to the same queries, even without CoT. Our analysis reflects a potential risk of overfitting/bias toward instructions introduced in IFT, which becomes more common in training LLMs. In addition, it indicates possible leakage of the pretraining recipe, e.g., one can verify whether a dataset and instruction were used in training ChatGPT.

At last, we perform few-shot prompts that show consistent improvement across different base prompts. Our work provides empirical evidence that ChatGPT still has great potential in translations.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02182v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Geotechnical Parrot Tales (GPT): Overcoming GPT hallucinations with prompt engineering for geotechnical applications","abstract":"The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, could revolutionized various industries, including geotechnical engineering. However, GPT models can sometimes generate plausible-sounding but false outputs, leading to hallucinations. In this article, we discuss the importance of prompt engineering in mitigating these risks and harnessing the full potential of GPT for geotechnical applications. We explore the challenges and pitfalls associated with LLMs and highlight the role of context in ensuring accurate and valuable responses. Furthermore, we examine the development of context-specific search engines and the potential of LLMs to become a natural interface for complex tasks, such as data analysis and design. We also develop a unified interface using natural language to handle complex geotechnical engineering tasks and data analysis. By integrating GPT into geotechnical engineering workflows, professionals can streamline their work and develop sustainable and resilient infrastructure systems for the future.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02138v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Large Language Models are Edge-Case Fuzzers: Testing Deep Learning Libraries via FuzzGPT","abstract":"Deep Learning (DL) library bugs affect downstream DL applications, emphasizing the need for reliable systems. Generating valid input programs for fuzzing DL libraries is challenging due to the need for satisfying both language syntax/semantics and constraints for constructing valid computational graphs. Recently, the TitanFuzz work demonstrates that modern Large Language Models (LLMs) can be directly leveraged to implicitly learn all the constraints to generate valid DL programs for fuzzing. However, LLMs tend to generate ordinary programs following similar patterns seen in their massive training corpora, while fuzzing favors unusual inputs that cover edge cases or are unlikely to be manually produced.   To fill this gap, this paper proposes FuzzGPT, the first technique to prime LLMs to synthesize unusual programs for fuzzing. FuzzGPT is built on the well-known hypothesis that historical bug-triggering programs may include rare/valuable code ingredients important for bug finding. Traditional techniques leveraging such historical information require intensive human efforts to design dedicated generators and ensure the validity of generated programs. FuzzGPT demonstrates that this process can be fully automated via the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs (including fine-tuning and in-context learning), while being generalizable and applicable to challenging domains. While FuzzGPT can be applied with different LLMs, this paper focuses on the powerful GPT-style models: Codex and CodeGen. Moreover, FuzzGPT also shows the potential of directly leveraging the instruct-following capability of the recent ChatGPT for effective fuzzing. Evaluation on two popular DL libraries (PyTorch and TensorFlow) shows that FuzzGPT can substantially outperform TitanFuzz, detecting 76 bugs, with 49 already confirmed as previously unknown bugs, including 11 high-priority bugs or security vulnerabilities.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02014v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"LLM-Adapters: An Adapter Family for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models","abstract":"The success of large language models (LLMs), like GPT-3 and ChatGPT, has led to the development of numerous cost-effective and accessible alternatives that are created by fine-tuning open-access LLMs with task-specific data (e.g., ChatDoctor) or instruction data (e.g., Alpaca). Among the various fine-tuning methods, adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is undoubtedly one of the most attractive topics, as it only requires fine-tuning a few external parameters instead of the entire LLMs while achieving comparable or even better performance. To enable further research on PEFT methods of LLMs, this paper presents LLM-Adapters, an easy-to-use framework that integrates various adapters into LLMs and can execute these adapter-based PEFT methods of LLMs for different tasks. The framework includes state-of-the-art open-access LLMs such as LLaMA, BLOOM, OPT, and GPT-J, as well as widely used adapters such as Series adapter, Parallel adapter, and LoRA. The framework is designed to be research-friendly, efficient, modular, and extendable, allowing the integration of new adapters and the evaluation of them with new and larger-scale LLMs. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of adapters in LLMs-Adapters, we conduct experiments on six math reasoning datasets. The results demonstrate that using adapter-based PEFT in smaller-scale LLMs (7B) with few extra trainable parameters yields comparable, and in some cases superior, performance to that of powerful LLMs (175B) in zero-shot inference on simple math reasoning datasets. Overall, we provide a promising framework for fine-tuning large LLMs on downstream tasks. We believe the proposed LLMs-Adapters will advance adapter-based PEFT research, facilitate the deployment of research pipelines, and enable practical applications to real-world systems.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01933v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

However, there is currently a dearth of comprehensive study exploring its potential in the area of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC). To showcase its capabilities in GEC, we design zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and few-shot CoT settings using in-context learning for ChatGPT. Our evaluation involves assessing ChatGPT's performance on five official test sets in three different languages, along with three document-level GEC test sets in English. Our experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate that ChatGPT has excellent error detection capabilities and can freely correct errors to make the corrected sentences very fluent, possibly due to its over-correction tendencies and not adhering to the principle of minimal edits. Additionally, its performance in non-English and low-resource settings highlights its potential in multilingual GEC tasks. However, further analysis of various types of errors at the document-level has shown that ChatGPT cannot effectively correct agreement, coreference, tense errors across sentences, and cross-sentence boundary errors.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01746v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

As ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge, concerns of misusing them in various ways increase, such as disseminating fake news, plagiarism, manipulating public opinion, cheating, and fraud. Hence, distinguishing AI-generated from human-generated becomes increasingly essential. Researchers have proposed various detection methodologies, ranging from basic binary classifiers to more complex deep-learning models. Some detection techniques rely on statistical characteristics or syntactic patterns, while others incorporate semantic or contextual information to improve accuracy. The primary objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive and contemporary assessment of the most recent techniques in ChatGPT detection. Additionally, we evaluated other AI-generated text detection tools that do not specifically claim to detect ChatGPT-generated content to assess their performance in detecting ChatGPT-generated content. For our evaluation, we have curated a benchmark dataset consisting of prompts from ChatGPT and humans, including diverse questions from medical, open Q&A, and finance domains and user-generated responses from popular social networking platforms.

{"title":"On the Prime Number Divisibility by Deep Learning","abstract":"Certain tasks such as determining whether a given integer can be divided by 2, 3, or other prime numbers may be trivial for human beings, but can be less straightforward for computers in the absence of pre-specified algorithms. In this paper, we tested multiple deep learning architectures and feature engineering approaches, and evaluated the scenario of determining divisibility of large finite integers (up to $2^{32}$) by small prime numbers. It turns out that, regardless of the network frameworks or the complexity of the network structures (CNN, RNN, Transformer, etc.), the ability to predict the prime number divisibility critically depends on the feature space fed into the deep learning models. We also evaluated commercially available Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) pipelines from Amazon, Google and Microsoft, and demonstrated that they failed to address this issue unless appropriately engineered features were provided. We further proposed a closed form solution to the problem using the ordinary linear regression on Fourier series basis vectors, and showed its success. Finally, we evaluated prompt-based learning using ChatGPT and demonstrated its success on small primes and apparent failures on larger primes. We conclude that feature engineering remains an important task to improve the performance, increase the interpretability, and reduce the complexity of machine learning/deep learning models, even in the era of AutoML and large-language models (LLMs).","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01333v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

While LLMs are being quickly applied to many AI application domains, we are interested in the following question: Can safety analysis for safety-critical systems make use of LLMs? To answer, we conduct a case study of Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) on Automatic Emergency Brake (AEB) systems using ChatGPT. STPA, one of the most prevalent techniques for hazard analysis, is known to have limitations such as high complexity and subjectivity, which this paper aims to explore the use of ChatGPT to address. Specifically, three ways of incorporating ChatGPT into STPA are investigated by considering its interaction with human experts: one-off simplex interaction, recurring simplex interaction, and recurring duplex interaction. Comparative results reveal that: (i) using ChatGPT without human experts' intervention can be inadequate due to reliability and accuracy issues of LLMs; (ii) more interactions between ChatGPT and human experts may yield better results; and (iii) using ChatGPT in STPA with extra care can outperform human safety experts alone, as demonstrated by reusing an existing comparison method with baselines. In addition to making the first attempt to apply LLMs in safety analysis, this paper also identifies key challenges (e.g., trustworthiness concern of LLMs, the need of standardisation) for future research in this direction.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01246v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

This advancement, despite their benefits, can also cause security and privacy issues (e.g., plagiarism, identity obfuscation, disinformation attack). As such, it has become critically important to develop effective, practical, and scalable solutions to differentiate deepfake texts from human-written texts. Toward this challenge, in this work, we investigate how factors such as skill levels and collaborations impact how humans identify deepfake texts, studying three research questions: (1) do collaborative teams detect deepfake texts better than individuals? (2) do expert humans detect deepfake texts better than non-expert humans? (3) what are the factors that maximize the detection performance of humans? We implement these questions on two platforms: (1) non-expert humans or asynchronous teams on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and (2) expert humans or synchronous teams on the Upwork. By analyzing the detection performance and the factors that affected performance, some of our key findings are: (1) expert humans detect deepfake texts significantly better than non-expert humans, (2) synchronous teams on the Upwork detect deepfake texts significantly better than individuals, while asynchronous teams on the AMT detect deepfake texts weakly better than individuals, and (3) among various error categories, examining coherence and consistency in texts is useful in detecting deepfake texts. In conclusion, our work could inform the design of future tools/framework to improve collaborative human detection of deepfake texts.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01002v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"LLMMaps -- A Visual Metaphor for Stratified Evaluation of Large Language Models","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks. Unfortunately, they are prone to hallucinations, where the model exposes incorrect or false information in its responses, which renders diligent evaluation approaches mandatory. While LLM performance in specific knowledge fields is often evaluated based on question and answer (Q&A) datasets, such evaluations usually report only a single accuracy number for the entire field, a procedure which is problematic with respect to transparency and model improvement. A stratified evaluation could instead reveal subfields, where hallucinations are more likely to occur and thus help to better assess LLMs' risks and guide their further development. To support such stratified evaluations, we propose LLMMaps as a novel visualization technique that enables users to evaluate LLMs' performance with respect to Q&A datasets. LLMMaps provide detailed insights into LLMs' knowledge capabilities in different subfields, by transforming Q&A datasets as well as LLM responses into our internal knowledge structure. An extension for comparative visualization furthermore, allows for the detailed comparison of multiple LLMs. To assess LLMMaps we use them to conduct a comparative analysis of several state-of-the-art LLMs, such as BLOOM, GPT-2, GPT-3, ChatGPT and LLaMa-13B, as well as two qualitative user evaluations.

{"title":"Keep the Conversation Going: Fixing 162 out of 337 bugs for $0.42 each using ChatGPT","abstract":"Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate patches for buggy programs. Recent APR work has been focused on leveraging modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly generate patches for APR. Such LLM-based APR tools work by first constructing an input prompt built using the original buggy code and then queries the LLM to generate patches. While the LLM-based APR tools are able to achieve state-of-the-art results, it still follows the classic Generate and Validate repair paradigm of first generating lots of patches and then validating each one afterwards. This not only leads to many repeated patches that are incorrect but also miss the crucial information in test failures as well as in plausible patches.   To address these limitations, we propose ChatRepair, the first fully automated conversation-driven APR approach that interleaves patch generation with instant feedback to perform APR in a conversational style. ChatRepair first feeds the LLM with relevant test failure information to start with, and then learns from both failures and successes of earlier patching attempts of the same bug for more powerful APR. For earlier patches that failed to pass all tests, we combine the incorrect patches with their corresponding relevant test failure information to construct a new prompt for the LLM to generate the next patch. In this way, we can avoid making the same mistakes. For earlier patches that passed all the tests, we further ask the LLM to generate alternative variations of the original plausible patches. In this way, we can further build on and learn from earlier successes to generate more plausible patches to increase the chance of having correct patches. While our approach is general, we implement ChatRepair using state-of-the-art dialogue-based LLM -- ChatGPT.

Four LLMs, ChatGPT (GPT-3.5), ChatGPT (GPT-4), Bard (LaMDA), and BLOOMZ, were evaluated against medical physicists and non-experts. ChatGPT (GPT-4) outperformed all other LLMs as well as medical physicists, on average. The performance of ChatGPT (GPT-4) was further improved when prompted to explain first, then answer. ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) showed a high level of consistency in its answer choices across a number of trials, whether correct or incorrect, a characteristic that was not observed in the human test groups. In evaluating ChatGPTs (GPT-4) deductive reasoning ability using a novel approach (substituting the correct answer with \"None of the above choices is the correct answer.\"), ChatGPT (GPT-4) demonstrated surprising accuracy, suggesting the potential presence of an emergent ability. Finally, although ChatGPT (GPT-4) performed well overall, its intrinsic properties did not allow for further improvement when scoring based on a majority vote across trials.

{"title":"A Survey of Large Language Models","abstract":"Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation.

This includes interaction with ChatGPT in natural language and using mathematical formalism, which, under careful supervision by a human-expert, led to producing a working code in MATLAB, Python and R for sampling from a given copula model, evaluation of the model's density, performing maximum likelihood estimation, optimizing the code for parallel computing for CPUs as well as for GPUs, and visualization of the computed results. In contrast to other emerging studies that assess the accuracy of LLMs like ChatGPT on tasks from a selected area, this work rather investigates ways how to achieve a successful solution of a standard statistical task in a collaboration of a human-expert and artificial intelligence (AI). Particularly, through careful prompt engineering, we separate successful solutions generated by ChatGPT from unsuccessful ones, resulting in a comprehensive list of related pros and cons. It is demonstrated that if the typical pitfalls are avoided, we can substantially benefit from collaborating with an AI partner. For example, we show that if ChatGPT is not able to provide a correct solution due to a lack of or incorrect knowledge, the human-expert can feed it with the correct knowledge, e.g., in the form of mathematical theorems and formulas, and make it to apply the gained knowledge in order to provide a solution that is correct.

This seemingly simple question has a surprisingly complex answer that even ChatGPT struggles to answer. To shed light on this, we present a database with the literature's answers to this question. We find values spanning 67-100 for the number of detections from double compact object mergers to date, emphasizing that the exact number of detections is uncertain and depends on the chosen data analysis pipeline and underlying assumptions. We also review the number of gravitational-wave detections expected in the coming decades with future observing runs, finding values up to millions of detections per year in the era of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope. We present a publicly available code to visualize the detection numbers, highlighting the exponential growth in gravitational-wave observations in the coming decades and the exciting prospects of gravitational-wave astrophysics.

{"title":"HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in HuggingFace","abstract":"Solving complicated AI tasks with different domains and modalities is a key step toward advanced artificial intelligence. While there are abundant AI models available for different domains and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI tasks. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional ability in language understanding, generation, interaction, and reasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks and language could be a generic interface to empower this. Based on this philosophy, we present HuggingGPT, a framework that leverages LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to connect various AI models in machine learning communities (e.g., Hugging Face) to solve AI tasks. Specifically, we use ChatGPT to conduct task planning when receiving a user request, select models according to their function descriptions available in Hugging Face, execute each subtask with the selected AI model, and summarize the response according to the execution results. By leveraging the strong language capability of ChatGPT and abundant AI models in Hugging Face, HuggingGPT is able to cover numerous sophisticated AI tasks in different modalities and domains and achieve impressive results in language, vision, speech, and other challenging tasks, which paves a new way towards advanced artificial intelligence.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

Given its usage by users from various nations and its training on a vast multilingual corpus that incorporates diverse cultural and societal norms, it is crucial to evaluate its effectiveness in cultural adaptation. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cultural background of ChatGPT by analyzing its responses to questions designed to quantify human cultural differences. Our findings suggest that, when prompted with American context, ChatGPT exhibits a strong alignment with American culture, but it adapts less effectively to other cultural contexts. Furthermore, by using different prompts to probe the model, we show that English prompts reduce the variance in model responses, flattening out cultural differences and biasing them towards American culture. This study provides valuable insights into the cultural implications of ChatGPT and highlights the necessity of greater diversity and cultural awareness in language technologies.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17466v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"WavCaps: A ChatGPT-Assisted Weakly-Labelled Audio Captioning Dataset for Audio-Language Multimodal Research","abstract":"The advancement of audio-language (AL) multimodal learning tasks has been significant in recent years. However, researchers face challenges due to the costly and time-consuming collection process of existing audio-language datasets, which are limited in size. To address this data scarcity issue, we introduce WavCaps, the first large-scale weakly-labelled audio captioning dataset, comprising approximately 400k audio clips with paired captions. We sourced audio clips and their raw descriptions from web sources and a sound event detection dataset. However, the online-harvested raw descriptions are highly noisy and unsuitable for direct use in tasks such as automated audio captioning. To overcome this issue, we propose a three-stage processing pipeline for filtering noisy data and generating high-quality captions, where ChatGPT, a large language model, is leveraged to filter and transform raw descriptions automatically. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of WavCaps dataset and evaluate it on multiple downstream audio-language multimodal learning tasks. The systems trained on WavCaps outperform previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by a significant margin. Our aspiration is for the WavCaps dataset we have proposed to facilitate research in audio-language multimodal learning and demonstrate the potential of utilizing ChatGPT to enhance academic research.

Can ChatGPT Identify Entities in Historical Documents?","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have been leveraged for several years now, obtaining state-of-the-art performance in recognizing entities from modern documents. For the last few months, the conversational agent ChatGPT has \"prompted\" a lot of interest in the scientific community and public due to its capacity of generating plausible-sounding answers. In this paper, we explore this ability by probing it in the named entity recognition and classification (NERC) task in primary sources (e.g., historical newspapers and classical commentaries) in a zero-shot manner and by comparing it with state-of-the-art LM-based systems. Our findings indicate several shortcomings in identifying entities in historical text that range from the consistency of entity annotation guidelines, entity complexity, and code-switching, to the specificity of prompting. Moreover, as expected, the inaccessibility of historical archives to the public (and thus on the Internet) also impacts its performance.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17322v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Synthesis of Mathematical programs from Natural Language Specifications","abstract":"Several decision problems that are encountered in various business domains can be modeled as mathematical programs, i.e. optimization problems. The process of conducting such modeling often requires the involvement of experts trained in operations research and advanced algorithms. Surprisingly, despite the significant advances in the methods for program and code synthesis, AutoML, learning to optimize etc., there has been little or no attention paid to automating the task of synthesizing mathematical programs. We imagine a scenario where the specifications for modeling, i.e. the objective and constraints are expressed in an unstructured form in natural language (NL) and the mathematical program has to be synthesized from such an NL specification. In this work we evaluate the efficacy of employing CodeT5 with data augmentation and post-processing of beams. We utilize GPT-3 with back translation for generation of synthetic examples. Further we apply rules of linear programming to score beams and correct beams based on common error patterns. We observe that with these enhancements CodeT5 base gives an execution accuracy of 0.73 which is significantly better than zero-shot execution accuracy of 0.41 by ChatGPT and 0.36 by Codex.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03287v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

In particular, we focused on (orthogonal) diagonalization and singular value decomposition (SVD). We also offered the possibility of exploring these topics using SageMath, a Python-based free open software computer algebra system (CAS) that has been identified to be useful for assisting many students in the computational process even though its output is static by nature. We then explored dynamic ChatGPT by inquiring the chatbot about the topic, either by asking to provide an example or to solve a problem, that is by constructing an (orthogonal) diagonalization or SVD from a particular matrix. By consolidating essential concepts in linear algebra and improving computational skills through effective practice, mastering these topics would become easier and mistakes could be minimized. Static SageMath, in particular, is a great aid for calculation confirmation and handling tedious computations. Although dynamic ChatGPT is relatively unreliable for solving problems in linear algebra, the mistakes it produces could become a valuable tool for improving critical thinking skills.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17163v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

In this proposal, we demonstrate that indeed ChatGPT can assist in data cleaning by suggesting corrections for specific cells in a data table (scenario 1). However, ChatGPT may struggle with datasets it has never encountered before (e.g., local enterprise data) or when the user requires an explanation of the source of the suggested clean values. To address these issues, we developed a retrieval-based method that complements ChatGPT's power with a user-provided data lake. The data lake is first indexed, we then retrieve the top-k relevant tuples to the user's query tuple and finally leverage ChatGPT to infer the correct value (scenario 2). Nevertheless, sharing enterprise data with ChatGPT, an externally hosted model, might not be feasible for privacy reasons. To assist with this scenario, we developed a custom RoBERTa-based foundation model that can be locally deployed. By fine-tuning it on a small number of examples, it can effectively make value inferences based on the retrieved tuples (scenario 3). Our proposed system, RetClean, seamlessly supports all three scenarios and provides a user-friendly GUI that enables the VLDB audience to explore and experiment with the system.","created":"2023-03-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16909v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"TaskMatrix.AI: Completing Tasks by Connecting Foundation Models with Millions of APIs","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made incredible progress recently. On the one hand, advanced foundation models like ChatGPT can offer powerful conversation, in-context learning and code generation abilities on a broad range of open-domain tasks. They can also generate high-level solution outlines for domain-specific tasks based on the common sense knowledge they have acquired. However, they still face difficulties with some specialized tasks because they lack enough domain-specific data during pre-training or they often have errors in their neural network computations on those tasks that need accurate executions. On the other hand, there are also many existing models and systems (symbolic-based or neural-based) that can do some domain-specific tasks very well. However, due to the different implementation or working mechanisms, they are not easily accessible or compatible with foundation models. Therefore, there is a clear and pressing need for a mechanism that can leverage foundation models to propose task solution outlines and then automatically match some of the sub-tasks in the outlines to the off-the-shelf models and systems with special functionalities to complete them. Inspired by this, we introduce TaskMatrix.AI as a new AI ecosystem that connects foundation models with millions of APIs for task completion. Unlike most previous work that aimed to improve a single AI model, TaskMatrix.AI focuses more on using existing foundation models (as a brain-like central system) and APIs of other AI models and systems (as sub-task solvers) to achieve diversified tasks in both digital and physical domains. As a position paper, we will present our vision of how to build such an ecosystem, explain each key component, and use study cases to illustrate both the feasibility of this vision and the main challenges we need to address next.","created":"2023-03-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16434v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

(2) ChatGPT is knowledgeable, and can accurately generate most of the commonsense knowledge using knowledge prompts. (3) Despite its knowledge, ChatGPT is an inexperienced commonsense problem solver, which cannot precisely identify the needed commonsense knowledge for answering a specific question, i.e., ChatGPT does not precisely know what commonsense knowledge is required to answer a question.

Distinguishing authorship with over 99% accuracy using off-the-shelf machine learning tools","abstract":"ChatGPT has enabled access to AI-generated writing for the masses, and within just a few months, this product has disrupted the knowledge economy, initiating a culture shift in the way people work, learn, and write. The need to discriminate human writing from AI is now both critical and urgent, particularly in domains like higher education and academic writing, where AI had not been a significant threat or contributor to authorship. Addressing this need, we developed a method for discriminating text generated by ChatGPT from (human) academic scientists, relying on prevalent and accessible supervised classification methods. We focused on how a particular group of humans, academic scientists, write differently than ChatGPT, and this targeted approach led to the discovery of new features for discriminating (these) humans from AI; as examples, scientists write long paragraphs and have a penchant for equivocal language, frequently using words like but, however, and although. With a set of 20 features, including the aforementioned ones and others, we built a model that assigned the author, as human or AI, at well over 99% accuracy, resulting in 20 times fewer misclassified documents compared to the field-leading approach. This strategy for discriminating a particular set of humans writing from AI could be further adapted and developed by others with basic skills in supervised classification, enabling access to many highly accurate and targeted models for detecting AI usage in academic writing and beyond.","created":"2023-03-28","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16352v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"A Perspectival Mirror of the Elephant: Investigating Language Bias on Google, ChatGPT, Wikipedia, and YouTube","abstract":"Contrary to Google Search's mission of delivering information from \"many angles so you can form your own understanding of the world,\" we find that Google and its most prominent returned results -- Wikipedia and YouTube, simply reflect the narrow set of cultural stereotypes tied to the search language for complex topics like \"Buddhism,\" \"Liberalism,\" \"colonization,\" \"Iran\" and \"America.\" Simply stated, they present, to varying degrees, distinct information across the same search in different languages (we call it 'language bias'). Instead of presenting a global picture of a complex topic, our online searches turn us into the proverbial blind person touching a small portion of an elephant, ignorant of the existence of other cultural perspectives. The language we use to search ends up as a cultural filter to promote ethnocentric views, where a person evaluates other people or ideas based on their own culture. We also find that language bias is deeply embedded in ChatGPT. As it is primarily trained on English language data, it presents the Anglo-American perspective as the normative view, reducing the complexity of a multifaceted issue to the single Anglo-American standard. In this paper, we present evidence and analysis of language bias and discuss its larger social implications. Toward the end of the paper, we propose a potential framework of using automatic translation to leverage language bias and argue that the task of piecing together a genuine depiction of the elephant is a challenging and important endeavor that deserves a new area of research in NLP and requires collaboration with scholars from the humanities to create ethically sound and socially responsible technology together.","created":"2023-03-28","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16281v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"Linguistically Informed ChatGPT Prompts to Enhance Japanese-Chinese Machine Translation: A Case Study on Attributive Clauses","abstract":"In the field of Japanese-Chinese translation linguistics, the issue of correctly translating attributive clauses has persistently proven to be challenging. Present-day machine translation tools often fail to accurately translate attributive clauses from Japanese to Chinese. In light of this, this paper investigates the linguistic problem underlying such difficulties, namely how does the semantic role of the modified noun affect the selection of translation patterns for attributive clauses, from a linguistic perspective. To ad-dress these difficulties, a pre-edit scheme is proposed, which aims to enhance the accuracy of translation. Furthermore, we propose a novel two-step prompt strategy, which combines this pre-edit scheme with ChatGPT, currently the most widely used large language model. This prompt strategy is capable of optimizing translation input in zero-shot scenarios and has been demonstrated to improve the average translation accuracy score by over 35%.","created":"2023-03-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15587v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"ChatGPT Outperforms Crowd-Workers for Text-Annotation Tasks","abstract":"Many NLP applications require manual data annotations for a variety of tasks, notably to train classifiers or evaluate the performance of unsupervised models. Depending on the size and degree of complexity, the tasks may be conducted by crowd-workers on platforms such as MTurk as well as trained annotators, such as research assistants. Using a sample of 2,382 tweets, we demonstrate that ChatGPT outperforms crowd-workers for several annotation tasks, including relevance, stance, topics, and frames detection. Specifically, the zero-shot accuracy of ChatGPT exceeds that of crowd-workers for four out of five tasks, while ChatGPT's intercoder agreement exceeds that of both crowd-workers and trained annotators for all tasks. Moreover, the per-annotation cost of ChatGPT is less than $0.003 -- about twenty times cheaper than MTurk. These results show the potential of large language models to drastically increase the efficiency of text classification.","created":"2023-03-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15056v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"MGTBench: Benchmarking Machine-Generated Text Detection","abstract":"Nowadays large language models (LLMs) have shown revolutionary power in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, and question-answering. In this way, detecting machine-generated texts (MGTs) is becoming increasingly important as LLMs become more advanced and prevalent. These models can generate human-like language that can be difficult to distinguish from text written by a human, which raises concerns about authenticity, accountability, and potential bias. However, existing detection methods against MGTs are evaluated under different model architectures, datasets, and experimental settings, resulting in a lack of a comprehensive evaluation framework across different methodologies   In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing the first benchmark framework for MGT detection, named MGTBench. Extensive evaluations on public datasets with curated answers generated by ChatGPT (the most representative and powerful LLMs thus far) show that most of the current detection methods perform less satisfactorily against MGTs. An exceptional case is ChatGPT Detector, which is trained with ChatGPT-generated texts and shows great performance in detecting MGTs. Nonetheless, we note that only a small fraction of adversarial-crafted perturbations on MGTs can evade the ChatGPT Detector, thus highlighting the need for more robust MGT detection methods. We envision that MGTBench will serve as a benchmark tool to accelerate future investigations involving the evaluation of state-of-the-art MGT detection methods on their respective datasets and the development of more advanced MGT detection methods.

{"title":"Exploring the Impact of Instruction Data Scaling on Large Language Models: An Empirical Study on Real-World Use Cases","abstract":"The success of ChatGPT has recently attracted numerous efforts to replicate it, with instruction-tuning strategies being a key factor in achieving remarkable results. Instruction-tuning not only significantly enhances the model's performance and generalization but also makes the model's generated results more consistent with human speech patterns. However current research rarely studies the impact of different amounts of instruction data on model performance, especially in the real-world use cases. In this paper we explore the performance of large language models based on instruction tuning across different scales of instruction data. An evaluation dataset consisting of 12 major online use cases is constructed in the experiment. With Bloomz-7B1-mt as the base model, the results show that 1) merely increasing the amount of instruction data leads to continuous improvement in tasks such as open-ended generation, 2) in tasks such as math and code, the model performance curve remains quite flat while increasing data size. We further analyze the possible causes of these phenomena and propose potential future research directions such as effectively selecting high-quality training data, scaling base models and training methods specialized for hard tasks. We will release our training and evaluation datasets, as well as model checkpoints.","created":"2023-03-26","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14742v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Mathematical Characterization of Signal Semantics and Rethinking of the Mathematical Theory of Information","abstract":"Shannon information theory is established based on probability and bits, and the communication technology based on this theory realizes the information age. The original goal of Shannon's information theory is to describe and transmit information content. However, due to information is related to cognition, and cognition is considered to be subjective, Shannon information theory is to describe and transmit information-bearing signals. With the development of the information age to the intelligent age, the traditional signal-oriented processing needs to be upgraded to content-oriented processing. For example, chat generative pre-trained transformer (ChatGPT) has initially realized the content processing capability based on massive data. For many years, researchers have been searching for the answer to what the information content in the signal is, because only when the information content is mathematically and accurately described can information-based machines be truly intelligent. This paper starts from rethinking the essence of the basic concepts of the information, such as semantics, meaning, information and knowledge, presents the mathematical characterization of the information content, investigate the relationship between them, studies the transformation from Shannon's signal information theory to semantic information theory, and therefore proposes a content-oriented semantic communication framework. Furthermore, we propose semantic decomposition and composition scheme to achieve conversion between complex and simple semantics. Finally, we verify the proposed characterization of information-related concepts by implementing evolvable knowledge-based semantic recognition.","created":"2023-03-26","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14701v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Guiding AI-Generated Digital Content with Wireless Perception","abstract":"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), coupled with a surge in training data, have led to the widespread use of AI for digital content generation, with ChatGPT serving as a representative example. Despite the increased efficiency and diversity, the inherent instability of AI models poses a persistent challenge in guiding these models to produce the desired content for users. In this paper, we introduce an integration of wireless perception (WP) with AI-generated content (AIGC) and propose a unified WP-AIGC framework to improve the quality of digital content production. The framework employs a novel multi-scale perception technology to read user's posture, which is difficult to describe accurately in words, and transmits it to the AIGC model as skeleton images. Based on these images and user's service requirements, the AIGC model generates corresponding digital content. Since the production process imposes the user's posture as a constraint on the AIGC model, it makes the generated content more aligned with the user's requirements. Additionally, WP-AIGC can also accept user's feedback, allowing adjustment of computing resources at edge server to improve service quality. Experiments results verify the effectiveness of the WP-AIGC framework, highlighting its potential as a novel approach for guiding AI models in the accurate generation of digital content.","created":"2023-03-26","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14624v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

This paper explores the potential of integrating LLMs in the hazard analysis for safety-critical systems, a process which we refer to as co-hazard analysis (CoHA). In CoHA, a human analyst interacts with an LLM via a context-aware chat session and uses the responses to support elicitation of possible hazard causes. In this experiment, we explore CoHA with three increasingly complex versions of a simple system, using Open AI's ChatGPT service.

{"title":"Chat-REC: Towards Interactive and Explainable LLMs-Augmented Recommender System","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their significant potential to be applied for addressing various application tasks. However, traditional recommender systems continue to face great challenges such as poor interactivity and explainability, which actually also hinder their broad deployment in real-world systems. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel paradigm called Chat-Rec (ChatGPT Augmented Recommender System) that innovatively augments LLMs for building conversational recommender systems by converting user profiles and historical interactions into prompts. Chat-Rec is demonstrated to be effective in learning user preferences and establishing connections between users and products through in-context learning, which also makes the recommendation process more interactive and explainable. What's more, within the Chat-Rec framework, user's preferences can transfer to different products for cross-domain recommendations, and prompt-based injection of information into LLMs can also handle the cold-start scenarios with new items. In our experiments, Chat-Rec effectively improve the results of top-k recommendations and performs better in zero-shot rating prediction task. Chat-Rec offers a novel approach to improving recommender systems and presents new practical scenarios for the implementation of AIGC (AI generated content) in recommender system studies.","created":"2023-03-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14524v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

However, such language models have not been tailored to the medical domain, resulting in poor answer accuracy and inability to give plausible recommendations for medical diagnosis, medications, etc. To address this issue, we collected more than 700 diseases and their corresponding symptoms, required medical tests, and recommended medications, from which we generated 5K doctor-patient conversations. In addition, we obtained 200K real patient-doctor conversations from online Q\\&A medical consultation sites. By fine-tuning LLMs using these 205k doctor-patient conversations, the resulting models emerge with great potential to understand patients' needs, provide informed advice, and offer valuable assistance in a variety of medical-related fields. The integration of these advanced language models into healthcare can revolutionize the way healthcare professionals and patients communicate, ultimately improving the overall efficiency and quality of patient care and outcomes. In addition, we made public all the source codes, datasets, and model weights to facilitate the further development of dialogue models in the medical field.

Although studies have explored the detection of human- and machine-paraphrased content, the comparison between these types of content remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of various datasets commonly employed for paraphrase detection tasks and evaluate an array of detection methods. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of different detection methods in terms of performance on individual datasets, revealing a lack of suitable machine-generated datasets that can be aligned with human expectations. Our main finding is that human-authored paraphrases exceed machine-generated ones in terms of difficulty, diversity, and similarity implying that automatically generated texts are not yet on par with human-level performance. Transformers emerged as the most effective method across datasets with TF-IDF excelling on semantically diverse corpora.

Recent research has shown that utilizing ChatGPT for assessing the quality of machine translation (MT) achieves state-of-the-art performance at the system level but performs poorly at the segment level. To further improve the performance of LLMs on MT quality assessment, we conducted an investigation into several prompting methods. Our results indicate that by combining Chain-of-Thoughts and Error Analysis, a new prompting method called \\textbf{\\texttt{Error Analysis Prompting}}, LLMs like ChatGPT can \\textit{generate human-like MT evaluations at both the system and segment level}. Additionally, we discovered some limitations of ChatGPT as an MT evaluator, such as unstable scoring and biases when provided with multiple translations in a single query. Our findings aim to provide a preliminary experience for appropriately evaluating translation quality on ChatGPT while offering a variety of tricks in designing prompts for in-context learning.

{"title":"Towards Making the Most of ChatGPT for Machine Translation","abstract":"ChatGPT shows remarkable capabilities for machine translation (MT). Several prior studies have shown that it achieves comparable results to commercial systems for high-resource languages, but lags behind in complex tasks, e.g, low-resource and distant-language-pairs translation. However, they usually adopt simple prompts which can not fully elicit the capability of ChatGPT. In this report, we aim to further mine ChatGPT's translation ability by revisiting several aspects: temperature, task information, and domain information, and correspondingly propose two (simple but effective) prompts: Task-Specific Prompts (TSP) and Domain-Specific Prompts (DSP). We show that: 1) The performance of ChatGPT depends largely on temperature, and a lower temperature usually can achieve better performance; 2) Emphasizing the task information further improves ChatGPT's performance, particularly in complex MT tasks; 3) Introducing domain information can elicit ChatGPT's generalization ability and improve its performance in the specific domain; 4) ChatGPT tends to generate hallucinations for non-English-centric MT tasks, which can be partially addressed by our proposed prompts but still need to be highlighted for the MT/NLP community. We also explore the effects of advanced in-context learning strategies and find a (negative but interesting) observation: the powerful chain-of-thought prompt leads to word-by-word translation behavior, thus bringing significant translation degradation.","created":"2023-03-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13780v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent times compels one to ask: can these systems be used for data generation? In this article, we explore prompting multilingual LLMs in a zero-shot manner to create code-mixed data for five languages in South East Asia (SEA) -- Indonesian, Malay, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, as well as the creole language Singlish. We find that ChatGPT shows the most potential, capable of producing code-mixed text 68% of the time when the term \"code-mixing\" is explicitly defined. Moreover, both ChatGPT's and InstructGPT's (davinci-003) performances in generating Singlish texts are noteworthy, averaging a 96% success rate across a variety of prompts. Their code-mixing proficiency, however, is dampened by word choice errors that lead to semantic inaccuracies. Other multilingual models such as BLOOMZ and Flan-T5-XXL are unable to produce code-mixed texts altogether.

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction.

We examine the utility of one such model for a particularly difficult measurement task: measuring the latent ideology of lawmakers, which allows us to better understand functions that are core to democracy, such as how politics shape policy and how political actors represent their constituents. We scale the senators of the 116th United States Congress along the liberal-conservative spectrum by prompting ChatGPT to select the more liberal (or conservative) senator in pairwise comparisons. We show that the LLM produced stable answers across repeated iterations, did not hallucinate, and was not simply regurgitating information from a single source. This new scale strongly correlates with pre-existing liberal-conservative scales such as NOMINATE, but also differs in several important ways, such as correctly placing senators who vote against their party for far-left or far-right ideological reasons on the extreme ends. The scale also highly correlates with ideological measures based on campaign giving and political activists' perceptions of these senators.

Consequently, this study compared the writing performance on a narrative topic by ChatGPT and Chinese intermediate English (CIE) learners so as to reveal the chatbot's advantage and disadvantage in writing. The data were analyzed in terms of five discourse components using Coh-Metrix (a special instrument for analyzing language discourses), and the results revealed that ChatGPT performed better than human writers in narrativity, word concreteness, and referential cohesion, but worse in syntactic simplicity and deep cohesion in its initial version. After more revision commands were updated, while the resulting version was facilitated in syntactic simplicity, yet it is still lagged far behind CIE learners' writing in deep cohesion. In addition, the correlation analysis of the discourse components suggests that narrativity was correlated with referential cohesion in both ChatGPT and human writers, but the correlations varied within each group.","created":"2023-03-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11812v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"ChatGPT for Programming Numerical Methods","abstract":"ChatGPT is a large language model recently released by the OpenAI company. In this technical report, we explore for the first time the capability of ChatGPT for programming numerical algorithms. Specifically, we examine the capability of GhatGPT for generating codes for numerical algorithms in different programming languages, for debugging and improving written codes by users, for completing missed parts of numerical codes, rewriting available codes in other programming languages, and for parallelizing serial codes. Additionally, we assess if ChatGPT can recognize if given codes are written by humans or machines. To reach this goal, we consider a variety of mathematical problems such as the Poisson equation, the diffusion equation, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, compressible inviscid flow, eigenvalue problems, solving linear systems of equations, storing sparse matrices, etc. Furthermore, we exemplify scientific machine learning such as physics-informed neural networks and convolutional neural networks with applications to computational physics. Through these examples, we investigate the successes, failures, and challenges of ChatGPT. Examples of failures are producing singular matrices, operations on arrays with incompatible sizes, programming interruption for relatively long codes, etc. Our outcomes suggest that ChatGPT can successfully program numerical algorithms in different programming languages, but certain limitations and challenges exist that require further improvement of this machine learning model.","created":"2023-03-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12093v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"A Complete Survey on Generative AI (AIGC): Is ChatGPT from GPT-4 to GPT-5 All You Need?","abstract":"As ChatGPT goes viral, generative AI (AIGC, a.k.a AI-generated content) has made headlines everywhere because of its ability to analyze and create text, images, and beyond. With such overwhelming media coverage, it is almost impossible for us to miss the opportunity to glimpse AIGC from a certain angle. In the era of AI transitioning from pure analysis to creation, it is worth noting that ChatGPT, with its most recent language model GPT-4, is just a tool out of numerous AIGC tasks. Impressed by the capability of the ChatGPT, many people are wondering about its limits: can GPT-5 (or other future GPT variants) help ChatGPT unify all AIGC tasks for diversified content creation? Toward answering this question, a comprehensive review of existing AIGC tasks is needed. As such, our work comes to fill this gap promptly by offering a first look at AIGC, ranging from its techniques to applications. Modern generative AI relies on various technical foundations, ranging from model architecture and self-supervised pretraining to generative modeling methods (like GAN and diffusion models). After introducing the fundamental techniques, this work focuses on the technological development of various AIGC tasks based on their output type, including text, images, videos, 3D content, etc., which depicts the full potential of ChatGPT's future. Moreover, we summarize their significant applications in some mainstream industries, such as education and creativity content. Finally, we discuss the challenges currently faced and present an outlook on how generative AI might evolve in the near future.","created":"2023-03-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11717v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

ChatGPT has exceeded expectations in its abilities, leading to extensive considerations of its potential applications and misuse. In this work, we evaluate the influence of ChatGPT on university education, with a primary focus on computer security-oriented specialization. We gather data regarding the effectiveness and usability of this tool for completing exams, programming assignments, and term papers. We evaluate multiple levels of tool misuse, ranging from utilizing it as a consultant to simply copying its outputs. While we demonstrate how easily ChatGPT can be used to cheat, we also discuss the potentially significant benefits to the educational system.

{"title":"DeID-GPT: Zero-shot Medical Text De-Identification by GPT-4","abstract":"The digitization of healthcare has facilitated the sharing and re-using of medical data but has also raised concerns about confidentiality and privacy. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) mandates removing re-identifying information before the dissemination of medical records. Thus, effective and efficient solutions for de-identifying medical data, especially those in free-text forms, are highly needed. While various computer-assisted de-identification methods, including both rule-based and learning-based, have been developed and used in prior practice, such solutions still lack generalizability or need to be fine-tuned according to different scenarios, significantly imposing restrictions in wider use. The advancement of large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have shown great potential in processing text data in the medical domain with zero-shot in-context learning, especially in the task of privacy protection, as these models can identify confidential information by their powerful named entity recognition (NER) capability. In this work, we developed a novel GPT4-enabled de-identification framework (\"DeID-GPT\") to automatically identify and remove the identifying information. Compared to existing commonly used medical text data de-identification methods, our developed DeID-GPT showed the highest accuracy and remarkable reliability in masking private information from the unstructured medical text while preserving the original structure and meaning of the text. This study is one of the earliest to utilize ChatGPT and GPT-4 for medical text data processing and de-identification, which provides insights for further research and solution development on the use of LLMs such as ChatGPT/GPT-4 in healthcare.

However, despite the abundance of research on the difference in capabilities between GPT series models and fine-tuned models, there has been limited attention given to the evolution of GPT series models' capabilities over time. To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities of GPT series models, we select six representative models, comprising two GPT-3 series models (i.e., davinci and text-davinci-001) and four GPT-3.5 series models (i.e., code-davinci-002, text-davinci-002, text-davinci-003, and gpt-3.5-turbo). We evaluate their performance on nine natural language understanding (NLU) tasks using 21 datasets. In particular, we compare the performance and robustness of different models for each task under zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Our extensive experiments reveal that the overall ability of GPT series models on NLU tasks does not increase gradually as the models evolve, especially with the introduction of the RLHF training strategy. While this strategy enhances the models' ability to generate human-like responses, it also compromises their ability to solve some tasks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that there is still room for improvement in areas such as model robustness.","created":"2023-03-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10420v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

It is now the consensus of the NLP community to adopt PLMs as the backbone for downstream tasks. In recent works on knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), BERT or its variants have become necessary in their KGQA models. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research and comparison of the performance of different PLMs in KGQA. To this end, we summarize two basic KGQA frameworks based on PLMs without additional neural network modules to compare the performance of nine PLMs in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we present three benchmarks for larger-scale KGs based on the popular SimpleQuestions benchmark to investigate the scalability of PLMs. We carefully analyze the results of all PLMs-based KGQA basic frameworks on these benchmarks and two other popular datasets, WebQuestionSP and FreebaseQA, and find that knowledge distillation techniques and knowledge enhancement methods in PLMs are promising for KGQA. Furthermore, we test ChatGPT, which has drawn a great deal of attention in the NLP community, demonstrating its impressive capabilities and limitations in zero-shot KGQA.

However, the massive computations, huge memory footprint, and thus high latency of Transformer-based models is an inevitable challenge for the cloud with high real-time requirement. To tackle the issue, we propose BBCT, a method of block-wise bit-compression for transformer without retraining. Our method achieves more fine-grained compression of the whole transformer, including embedding, matrix multiplication, GELU, softmax, layer normalization, and all the intermediate results. As a case, we compress an efficient BERT with the method of BBCT.

In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using ChatGPT in experiments on using ChatGPT to translate radiology reports into plain language for patients and healthcare providers so that they are educated for improved healthcare. Radiology reports from 62 low-dose chest CT lung cancer screening scans and 76 brain MRI metastases screening scans were collected in the first half of February for this study. According to the evaluation by radiologists, ChatGPT can successfully translate radiology reports into plain language with an average score of 4.27 in the five-point system with 0.08 places of information missing and 0.07 places of misinformation. In terms of the suggestions provided by ChatGPT, they are general relevant such as keeping following-up with doctors and closely monitoring any symptoms, and for about 37% of 138 cases in total ChatGPT offers specific suggestions based on findings in the report. ChatGPT also presents some randomness in its responses with occasionally over-simplified or neglected information, which can be mitigated using a more detailed prompt. Furthermore, ChatGPT results are compared with a newly released large model GPT-4, showing that GPT-4 can significantly improve the quality of translated reports. Our results show that it is feasible to utilize large language models in clinical education, and further efforts are needed to address limitations and maximize their potential.","created":"2023-03-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09038v3","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"SelfCheckGPT: Zero-Resource Black-Box Hallucination Detection for Generative Large Language Models","abstract":"Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 are capable of generating highly fluent responses to a wide variety of user prompts. However, LLMs are known to hallucinate facts and make non-factual statements which can undermine trust in their output. Existing fact-checking approaches either require access to token-level output probability distribution (which may not be available for systems such as ChatGPT) or external databases that are interfaced via separate, often complex, modules. In this work, we propose \"SelfCheckGPT\", a simple sampling-based approach that can be used to fact-check black-box models in a zero-resource fashion, i.e. without an external database. SelfCheckGPT leverages the simple idea that if a LLM has knowledge of a given concept, sampled responses are likely to be similar and contain consistent facts. However, for hallucinated facts, stochastically sampled responses are likely to diverge and contradict one another. We investigate this approach by using GPT-3 to generate passages about individuals from the WikiBio dataset, and manually annotate the factuality of the generated passages. We demonstrate that SelfCheckGPT can: i) detect non-factual and factual sentences; and ii) rank passages in terms of factuality. We compare our approach to several existing baselines and show that in sentence hallucination detection, our approach has AUC-PR scores comparable to grey-box methods, while SelfCheckGPT is best at passage factuality assessment.","created":"2023-03-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08896v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

By testing on the CoNLL2014 benchmark dataset, we find that ChatGPT performs not as well as those baselines in terms of the automatic evaluation metrics (e.g., $F_{0.5}$ score), particularly on long sentences. We inspect the outputs and find that ChatGPT goes beyond one-by-one corrections. Specifically, it prefers to change the surface expression of certain phrases or sentence structure while maintaining grammatical correctness. Human evaluation quantitatively confirms this and suggests that ChatGPT produces less under-correction or mis-correction issues but more over-corrections.

The first task aims to reduce ambiguity by detecting and tagging the entities of the optimization problems. The second task creates an intermediate representation of the linear programming (LP) problem that is converted into a format that can be used by commercial solvers.

Nevertheless, the performance and limitations of the model still need to be extensively evaluated. As ChatGPT covers resources such as Wikipedia and supports natural language question answering, it has garnered attention as a potential replacement for traditional knowledge based question answering (KBQA) models. Complex question answering is a challenge task of KBQA, which comprehensively tests the ability of models in semantic parsing and reasoning. To assess the performance of ChatGPT as a question answering system (QAS) using its own knowledge, we present a framework that evaluates its ability to answer complex questions.

The keywords from the abstracts of papers with over the mean similarity score were more likely to be similar whereas those from below the average score were less likely to be similar. Themes with high similarity scores include access, public transit, and policy, among others. Further, clear differences in the key pattern of clusters for high and low similarity score abstracts was observed. Contrarily, the findings from collocated keywords were inconclusive.

{"title":"Does ChatGPT resemble humans in language use?","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) and LLM-driven chatbots such as ChatGPT have shown remarkable capacities in comprehending and producing language. However, their internal workings remain a black box in cognitive terms, and it is unclear whether LLMs and chatbots can develop humanlike characteristics in language use. Cognitive scientists have devised many experiments that probe, and have made great progress in explaining, how people process language. We subjected ChatGPT to 12 of these experiments, pre-registered and with 1,000 runs per experiment. In 10 of them, ChatGPT replicated the human pattern of language use. It associated unfamiliar words with different meanings depending on their forms, continued to access recently encountered meanings of ambiguous words, reused recent sentence structures, reinterpreted implausible sentences that were likely to have been corrupted by noise, glossed over errors, drew reasonable inferences, associated causality with different discourse entities according to verb semantics, and accessed different meanings and retrieved different words depending on the identity of its interlocutor. However, unlike humans, it did not prefer using shorter words to convey less informative content and it did not use context to disambiguate syntactic ambiguities. We discuss how these convergences and divergences may occur in the transformer architecture. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that LLM-driven chatbots like ChatGPT are capable of mimicking human language processing to a great extent, and that they have the potential to provide insights into how people learn and use language.","created":"2023-03-10","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08014v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Personalisation within bounds: A risk taxonomy and policy framework for the alignment of large language models with personalised feedback","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) are used to generate content for a wide range of tasks, and are set to reach a growing audience in coming years due to integration in product interfaces like ChatGPT or search engines like Bing. This intensifies the need to ensure that models are aligned with human preferences and do not produce unsafe, inaccurate or toxic outputs. While alignment techniques like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and red-teaming can mitigate some safety concerns and improve model capabilities, it is unlikely that an aggregate fine-tuning process can adequately represent the full range of users' preferences and values. Different people may legitimately disagree on their preferences for language and conversational norms, as well as on values or ideologies which guide their communication. Personalising LLMs through micro-level preference learning processes may result in models that are better aligned with each user. However, there are several normative challenges in defining the bounds of a societally-acceptable and safe degree of personalisation. In this paper, we ask how, and in what ways, LLMs should be personalised. First, we review literature on current paradigms for aligning LLMs with human feedback, and identify issues including (i) a lack of clarity regarding what alignment means; (ii) a tendency of technology providers to prescribe definitions of inherently subjective preferences and values; and (iii) a 'tyranny of the crowdworker', exacerbated by a lack of documentation in who we are really aligning to. Second, we present a taxonomy of benefits and risks associated with personalised LLMs, for individuals and society at large. Finally, we propose a three-tiered policy framework that allows users to experience the benefits of personalised alignment, while restraining unsafe and undesirable LLM-behaviours within (supra-)national and organisational bounds.","created":"2023-03-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05453v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

However, while the debate on ChatGPT in academia is making waves, more understanding is needed among lecturers and teachers on how students use and perceive ChatGPT. To address this gap, we analyzed the content on ChatGPT available on TikTok in February 2023. TikTok is a rapidly growing social media platform popular among individuals under 30. Specifically, we analyzed the content of the 100 most popular videos in English tagged with #chatgpt, which collectively garnered over 250 million views. Most of the videos we studied promoted the use of ChatGPT for tasks like writing essays or code. In addition, many videos discussed AI detectors, with a focus on how other tools can help to transform ChatGPT output to fool these detectors. This also mirrors the discussion among educators on how to treat ChatGPT as lecturers and teachers in teaching and grading. What is, however, missing from the analyzed clips on TikTok are videos that discuss ChatGPT producing content that is nonsensical or unfaithful to the training data.","created":"2023-03-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05349v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

Despite their successes in NLP tasks, no investigation has been conducted to assess the ability of LLMs to perform document information extraction (DIE) using in-context learning. Applying LLMs to DIE poses two challenges: the modality and task gap. To this end, we propose a simple but effective in-context learning framework called ICL-D3IE, which enables LLMs to perform DIE with different types of demonstration examples. Specifically, we extract the most difficult and distinct segments from hard training documents as hard demonstrations for benefiting all test instances. We design demonstrations describing relationships that enable LLMs to understand positional relationships. We introduce formatting demonstrations for easy answer extraction. Additionally, the framework improves diverse demonstrations by updating them iteratively. Our experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the ICL-D3IE framework enables GPT-3/ChatGPT to achieve superior performance when compared to previous pre-trained methods fine-tuned with full training in both the in-distribution (ID) setting and in the out-of-distribution (OOD) setting.","created":"2023-03-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05063v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

However, since ChatGPT is trained with languages, it is currently not capable of processing or generating images from the visual world. At the same time, Visual Foundation Models, such as Visual Transformers or Stable Diffusion, although showing great visual understanding and generation capabilities, they are only experts on specific tasks with one-round fixed inputs and outputs. To this end, We build a system called \\textbf{Visual ChatGPT}, incorporating different Visual Foundation Models, to enable the user to interact with ChatGPT by 1) sending and receiving not only languages but also images 2) providing complex visual questions or visual editing instructions that require the collaboration of multiple AI models with multi-steps. 3) providing feedback and asking for corrected results.

{"title":"Does Synthetic Data Generation of LLMs Help Clinical Text Mining?","abstract":"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of highly potent models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. These models have exhibited exceptional performance in a variety of tasks, such as question answering, essay composition, and code generation. However, their effectiveness in the healthcare sector remains uncertain. In this study, we seek to investigate the potential of ChatGPT to aid in clinical text mining by examining its ability to extract structured information from unstructured healthcare texts, with a focus on biological named entity recognition and relation extraction. However, our preliminary results indicate that employing ChatGPT directly for these tasks resulted in poor performance and raised privacy concerns associated with uploading patients' information to the ChatGPT API. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new training paradigm that involves generating a vast quantity of high-quality synthetic data with labels utilizing ChatGPT and fine-tuning a local model for the downstream task. Our method has resulted in significant improvements in the performance of downstream tasks, improving the F1-score from 23.37% to 63.99% for the named entity recognition task and from 75.86% to 83.59% for the relation extraction task. Furthermore, generating data using ChatGPT can significantly reduce the time and effort required for data collection and labeling, as well as mitigate data privacy concerns. In summary, the proposed framework presents a promising solution to enhance the applicability of LLM models to clinical text mining.","created":"2023-03-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04360v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Many bioinformatics programming tasks can be automated with ChatGPT","abstract":"Computer programming is a fundamental tool for life scientists, allowing them to carry out many essential research tasks. However, despite a variety of educational efforts, learning to write code can be a challenging endeavor for both researchers and students in life science disciplines. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have made it possible to translate human-language prompts to functional code, raising questions about whether these technologies can aid (or replace) life scientists' efforts to write code. Using 184 programming exercises from an introductory-bioinformatics course, we evaluated the extent to which one such model -- OpenAI's ChatGPT -- can successfully complete basic- to moderate-level programming tasks. On its first attempt, ChatGPT solved 139 (75.5%) of the exercises. For the remaining exercises, we provided natural-language feedback to the model, prompting it to try different approaches. Within 7 or fewer attempts, ChatGPT solved 179 (97.3%) of the exercises. These findings have important implications for life-sciences research and education. For many programming tasks, researchers no longer need to write code from scratch. Instead, machine-learning models may produce usable solutions.

{"title":"A Comprehensive Survey of AI-Generated Content (AIGC): A History of Generative AI from GAN to ChatGPT","abstract":"Recently, ChatGPT, along with DALL-E-2 and Codex,has been gaining significant attention from society. As a result, many individuals have become interested in related resources and are seeking to uncover the background and secrets behind its impressive performance. In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI) techniques belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), which involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music, and natural language, through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the content creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the production of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by extracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by human, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent information. In recent years, large-scale models have become increasingly important in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus, improved generation results. With the growth of data and the size of the models, the distribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer to reality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This survey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and basic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and multimodal interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the generation tasks and relative models of text and image. From the perspective of multimodality, we introduce the cross-application between the modalities mentioned above.

{"title":"Extracting Accurate Materials Data from Research Papers with Conversational Language Models and Prompt Engineering -- Example of ChatGPT","abstract":"There has been a growing effort to replace hand extraction of data from research papers with automated data extraction based on natural language processing (NLP), language models (LMs), and recently, large language models (LLMs). Although these methods enable efficient extraction of data from large sets of research papers, they require a significant amount of up-front effort, expertise, and coding. In this work we propose the ChatExtract method that can fully automate very accurate data extraction with essentially no initial effort or background using an advanced conversational LLM (or AI). ChatExtract consists of a set of engineered prompts applied to a conversational LLM that both identify sentences with data, extract data, and assure its correctness through a series of follow-up questions. These follow-up questions address a critical challenge associated with LLMs - their tendency to provide factually inaccurate responses. ChatExtract can be applied with any conversational LLMs and yields very high quality data extraction. In tests on materials data we find precision and recall both over 90% from the best conversational LLMs, likely rivaling or exceeding human accuracy in many cases. We demonstrate that the exceptional performance is enabled by the information retention in a conversational model combined with purposeful redundancy and introducing uncertainty through follow-up prompts. These results suggest that approaches similar to ChatExtract, due to their simplicity, transferability and accuracy are likely to replace other methods of data extraction in the near future.","created":"2023-03-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05352v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

Considering assessing the quality of NLG models is an arduous task and previous statistical metrics notoriously show their poor correlation with human judgments, we wonder whether ChatGPT is a good NLG evaluation metric. In this report, we provide a preliminary meta-evaluation on ChatGPT to show its reliability as an NLG metric. In detail, we regard ChatGPT as a human evaluator and give task-specific (e.g., summarization) and aspect-specific (e.g., relevance) instruction to prompt ChatGPT to score the generation of NLG models. We conduct experiments on three widely-used NLG meta-evaluation datasets (including summarization, story generation and data-to-text tasks). Experimental results show that compared with previous automatic metrics, ChatGPT achieves state-of-the-art or competitive correlation with golden human judgments.

And if it is, how should we go about teaching them to do so? As early as 1950, Alan Turing stated that we ought to teach machines in the way of teaching a child. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a strong candidate toward allowing agents to learn from human feedback in a naturalistic manner. RLHF is distinct from traditional reinforcement learning as it provides feedback from a human teacher in addition to a reward signal. It has been catapulted into public view by multiple high-profile AI applications, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, DeepMind's Sparrow, and Anthropic's Claude. These highly capable chatbots are already overturning our understanding of how AI interacts with humanity. The wide applicability and burgeoning success of RLHF strongly motivate the need to evaluate its social impacts. In light of recent developments, this paper considers an important question: can RLHF be developed and used without negatively affecting human societies? Our objectives are threefold: to provide a systematic study of the social effects of RLHF; to identify key social and ethical issues of RLHF; and to discuss social impacts for stakeholders. Although text-based applications of RLHF have received much attention, it is crucial to consider when evaluating its social implications the diverse range of areas to which it may be deployed. We describe seven primary ways in which RLHF-based technologies will affect society by positively transforming human experiences with AI. This paper ultimately proposes that RLHF has potential to net positively impact areas of misinformation, AI value-alignment, bias, AI access, cross-cultural dialogue, industry, and workforce. As RLHF raises concerns that echo those of existing AI technologies, it will be important for all to be aware and intentional in the adoption of RLHF.","created":"2023-03-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02891v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

In this context, we are interested in exploring the application of LLMs to graph drawing algorithms by performing experiments on ChatGPT. These algorithms are used to improve the readability of graph visualizations. The probabilistic nature of LLMs presents challenges to implementing algorithms correctly, but we believe that LLMs' ability to learn from vast amounts of data and apply complex operations may lead to interesting graph drawing results. For example, we could enable users with limited coding backgrounds to use simple natural language to create effective graph visualizations. Natural language specification would make data visualization more accessible and user-friendly for a wider range of users.

These apparent abilities have prompted discussion of ChatGPT as both a threat to the integrity of higher education and conversely as a powerful teaching tool. In this work we present a preliminary analysis of how two versions of ChatGPT (ChatGPT3.5 and ChatGPT4) fare in the field of first-semester university physics, using a modified version of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) to assess whether it can give correct responses to conceptual physics questions about kinematics and Newtonian dynamics. We demonstrate that, by some measures, ChatGPT3.5 can match or exceed the median performance of a university student who has completed one semester of college physics, though its performance is notably uneven and the results are nuanced. By these same measures, we find that ChatGPT4's performance is approaching the point of being indistinguishable from that of an expert physicist when it comes to introductory mechanics topics. After the completion of our work we became aware of Ref [1], which preceded us to publication and which completes an extensive analysis of the abilities of ChatGPT3.5 in a physics class, including a different modified version of the FCI.

A General Evaluation Framework","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) especially ChatGPT have produced impressive results in various areas, but their potential human-like psychology is still largely unexplored. Existing works study the virtual personalities of LLMs but rarely explore the possibility of analyzing human personalities via LLMs. This paper presents a generic evaluation framework for LLMs to assess human personalities based on Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) tests. Specifically, we first devise unbiased prompts by randomly permuting options in MBTI questions and adopt the average testing result to encourage more impartial answer generation. Then, we propose to replace the subject in question statements to enable flexible queries and assessments on different subjects from LLMs. Finally, we re-formulate the question instructions in a manner of correctness evaluation to facilitate LLMs to generate clearer responses. The proposed framework enables LLMs to flexibly assess personalities of different groups of people. We further propose three evaluation metrics to measure the consistency, robustness, and fairness of assessment results from state-of-the-art LLMs including ChatGPT and InstructGPT. Our experiments reveal ChatGPT's ability to assess human personalities, and the average results demonstrate that it can achieve more consistent and fairer assessments in spite of lower robustness against prompt biases compared with InstructGPT.","created":"2023-03-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01248v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Large Language Models Are State-of-the-Art Evaluators of Translation Quality","abstract":"We describe GEMBA, a GPT-based metric for assessment of translation quality, which works both with a reference translation and without. In our evaluation, we focus on zero-shot prompting, comparing four prompt variants in two modes, based on the availability of the reference. We investigate seven versions of GPT models, including ChatGPT. We show that our method for translation quality assessment only works with GPT 3.5 and larger models. Comparing to results from WMT22's Metrics shared task, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both modes when compared to MQM-based human labels. Our results are valid on the system level for all three WMT22 Metrics shared task language pairs, namely English into German, English into Russian, and Chinese into English. This provides a first glimpse into the usefulness of pre-trained, generative large language models for quality assessment of translations. We publicly release all our code and prompt templates used for the experiments described in this work, as well as all corresponding scoring results, to allow for external validation and reproducibility.","created":"2023-02-28","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14520v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Summarization via Large Language Models","abstract":"Given a document in a source language, cross-lingual summarization (CLS) aims to generate a summary in a different target language. Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, ChatGPT and GPT-4, has attracted wide attention from the computational linguistics community. However, it is not yet known the performance of LLMs on CLS. In this report, we empirically use various prompts to guide LLMs to perform zero-shot CLS from different paradigms (i.e., end-to-end and pipeline), and provide a preliminary evaluation on the generated summaries. We find that ChatGPT and GPT-4 originally prefer to produce lengthy summaries with detailed information. These two LLMs can further balance informativeness and conciseness with the help of an interactive prompt, significantly improving their CLS performance. Experimental results on three widely-used CLS datasets show that GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot CLS performance, and performs competitively compared with the fine-tuned mBART-50. Moreover, we also find some multi-lingual and bilingual LLMs (i.e., BLOOMZ, ChatGLM-6B, Vicuna-13B and ChatYuan) have limited zero-shot CLS ability. Due to the composite nature of CLS, which requires models to perform summarization and translation simultaneously, accomplishing this task in a zero-shot manner is even a challenge for LLMs. Therefore, we sincerely hope and recommend future LLM research could use CLS as a testbed.","created":"2023-02-28","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14229v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"Towards Human-Bot Collaborative Software Architecting with ChatGPT","abstract":"Architecting software-intensive systems can be a complex process. It deals with the daunting tasks of unifying stakeholders' perspectives, designers' intellect, tool-based automation, pattern-driven reuse, and so on, to sketch a blueprint that guides software implementation and evaluation. Despite its benefits, architecture-centric software engineering (ACSE) inherits a multitude of challenges. ACSE challenges could stem from a lack of standardized processes, socio-technical limitations, and scarcity of human expertise etc. that can impede the development of existing and emergent classes of software (e.g., IoTs, blockchain, quantum systems). Software Development Bots (DevBots) trained on large language models can help synergise architects' knowledge with artificially intelligent decision support to enable rapid architecting in a human-bot collaborative ACSE. An emerging solution to enable this collaboration is ChatGPT, a disruptive technology not primarily introduced for software engineering, but is capable of articulating and refining architectural artifacts based on natural language processing. We detail a case study that involves collaboration between a novice software architect and ChatGPT for architectural analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of a services-driven software application. Preliminary results indicate that ChatGPT can mimic an architect's role to support and often lead ACSE, however; it requires human oversight and decision support for collaborative architecting. Future research focuses on harnessing empirical evidence about architects' productivity and exploring socio-technical aspects of architecting with ChatGPT to tackle emerging and futuristic challenges of ACSE.","created":"2023-02-26","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14600v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Fast Attention Requires Bounded Entries","abstract":"In modern machine learning, inner product attention computation is a fundamental task for training large language models such as Transformer, GPT-1, BERT, GPT-2, GPT-3 and ChatGPT. Formally, in this problem, one is given as input three matrices $Q, K, V \\in [-B,B]^{n \\times d}$, and the goal is to construct the matrix $\\mathrm{Att}(Q,K,V) := \\mathrm{diag}(A {\\bf 1}_n)^{-1} A V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, where $A = \\exp(QK^\\top/d)$ is the `attention matrix', and $\\exp$ is applied entry-wise. Straightforward methods for this problem explicitly compute the $n \\times n$ attention matrix $A$, and hence require time $\\Omega(n^2)$ even when $d = n^{o(1)}$ is small.   In this paper, we investigate whether faster algorithms are possible by implicitly making use of the matrix $A$. We present two results, showing that there is a sharp transition at $B = \\Theta(\\sqrt{\\log n})$.   $\\bullet$ If $d = O(\\log n)$ and $B = o(\\sqrt{\\log n})$, there is an $n^{1+o(1)}$ time algorithm to approximate $\\mathrm{Att}(Q,K,V)$ up to $1/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ additive error.   $\\bullet$ If $d = O(\\log n)$ and $B = \\Theta (\\sqrt{\\log n})$, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis from fine-grained complexity theory, it is impossible to approximate $\\mathrm{Att}(Q,K,V)$ up to $1/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ additive error in truly subquadratic time $n^{2 - \\Omega(1)}$.   This gives a theoretical explanation for the phenomenon observed in practice that attention computation is much more efficient when the input matrices have smaller entries.","created":"2023-02-26","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13214v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"AugGPT: Leveraging ChatGPT for Text Data Augmentation","abstract":"Text data augmentation is an effective strategy for overcoming the challenge of limited sample sizes in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This challenge is especially prominent in the few-shot learning scenario, where the data in the target domain is generally much scarcer and of lowered quality. A natural and widely-used strategy to mitigate such challenges is to perform data augmentation to better capture the data invariance and increase the sample size. However, current text data augmentation methods either can't ensure the correct labeling of the generated data (lacking faithfulness) or can't ensure sufficient diversity in the generated data (lacking compactness), or both. Inspired by the recent success of large language models, especially the development of ChatGPT, which demonstrated improved language comprehension abilities, in this work, we propose a text data augmentation approach based on ChatGPT (named AugGPT). AugGPT rephrases each sentence in the training samples into multiple conceptually similar but semantically different samples. The augmented samples can then be used in downstream model training. Experiment results on few-shot learning text classification tasks show the superior performance of the proposed AugGPT approach over state-of-the-art text data augmentation methods in terms of testing accuracy and distribution of the augmented samples.","created":"2023-02-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13007v3","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Check Your Facts and Try Again: Improving Large Language Models with External Knowledge and Automated Feedback","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are able to generate human-like, fluent responses for many downstream tasks, e.g., task-oriented dialog and question answering. However, applying LLMs to real-world, mission-critical applications remains challenging mainly due to their tendency to generate hallucinations and their inability to use external knowledge. This paper proposes a LLM-Augmenter system, which augments a black-box LLM with a set of plug-and-play modules. Our system makes the LLM generate responses grounded in external knowledge, e.g., stored in task-specific databases. It also iteratively revises LLM prompts to improve model responses using feedback generated by utility functions, e.g., the factuality score of a LLM-generated response. The effectiveness of LLM-Augmenter is empirically validated on two types of scenarios, task-oriented dialog and open-domain question answering. LLM-Augmenter significantly reduces ChatGPT's hallucinations without sacrificing the fluency and informativeness of its responses.

{"title":"Dr ChatGPT, tell me what I want to hear: How prompt knowledge impacts health answer correctness","abstract":"Generative pre-trained language models (GPLMs) like ChatGPT encode in the model's parameters knowledge the models observe during the pre-training phase. This knowledge is then used at inference to address the task specified by the user in their prompt. For example, for the question-answering task, the GPLMs leverage the knowledge and linguistic patterns learned at training to produce an answer to a user question. Aside from the knowledge encoded in the model itself, answers produced by GPLMs can also leverage knowledge provided in the prompts. For example, a GPLM can be integrated into a retrieve-then-generate paradigm where a search engine is used to retrieve documents relevant to the question; the content of the documents is then transferred to the GPLM via the prompt. In this paper we study the differences in answer correctness generated by ChatGPT when leveraging the model's knowledge alone vs. in combination with the prompt knowledge. We study this in the context of consumers seeking health advice from the model. Aside from measuring the effectiveness of ChatGPT in this context, we show that the knowledge passed in the prompt can overturn the knowledge encoded in the model and this is, in our experiments, to the detriment of answer correctness. This work has important implications for the development of more robust and transparent question-answering systems based on generative pre-trained language models.","created":"2023-02-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13793v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

The chatbot's responses, though somewhat vague and confusing, nonetheless recommended consulting with health professionals before attempting an \"at-home\" abortion. We used ChatGPT to create two TikTok video variants - one where users can see ChatGPT explicitly typing back a response, and one where the text response is presented without any notion to the chatbot. We randomly exposed 100 participants to each variant and found that the group of participants unaware of ChatGPT's text synthetization was more inclined to believe the responses were misinformation. Under the same impression, TikTok itself attached misinformation warning labels (\"Get the facts about abortion\") to all videos after we collected our initial results. We then decided to test the videos again with another set of 50 participants and found that the labels did not affect the perceptions of abortion misinformation except in the case where ChatGPT explicitly responded to a prompt for a lyrical output. We also found that more than 60% of the participants expressed negative or hesitant opinions about chatbots as sources of credible health information.","created":"2023-02-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13524v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"On the Robustness of ChatGPT: An Adversarial and Out-of-distribution Perspective","abstract":"ChatGPT is a recent chatbot service released by OpenAI and is receiving increasing attention over the past few months. While evaluations of various aspects of ChatGPT have been done, its robustness, i.e., the performance to unexpected inputs, is still unclear to the public. Robustness is of particular concern in responsible AI, especially for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of the robustness of ChatGPT from the adversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) perspective. To do so, we employ the AdvGLUE and ANLI benchmarks to assess adversarial robustness and the Flipkart review and DDXPlus medical diagnosis datasets for OOD evaluation. We select several popular foundation models as baselines. Results show that ChatGPT shows consistent advantages on most adversarial and OOD classification and translation tasks. However, the absolute performance is far from perfection, which suggests that adversarial and OOD robustness remains a significant threat to foundation models. Moreover, ChatGPT shows astounding performance in understanding dialogue-related texts and we find that it tends to provide informal suggestions for medical tasks instead of definitive answers. Finally, we present in-depth discussions of possible research directions.","created":"2023-02-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12095v4","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

The first contact with the chatbot reveals its ability to provide detailed and precise answers in various areas. There are several publications on ChatGPT evaluation, testing its effectiveness on well-known natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the existing studies are mostly non-automated and tested on a very limited scale. In this work, we examined ChatGPT's capabilities on 25 diverse analytical NLP tasks, most of them subjective even to humans, such as sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, offensiveness and stance detection, natural language inference, word sense disambiguation, linguistic acceptability and question answering. We automated ChatGPT's querying process and analyzed more than 38k responses. Our comparison of its results with available State-of-the-Art (SOTA) solutions showed that the average loss in quality of the ChatGPT model was about 25% for zero-shot and few-shot evaluation. We showed that the more difficult the task (lower SOTA performance), the higher the ChatGPT loss. It especially refers to pragmatic NLP problems like emotion recognition. We also tested the ability of personalizing ChatGPT responses for selected subjective tasks via Random Contextual Few-Shot Personalization, and we obtained significantly better user-based predictions. Additional qualitative analysis revealed a ChatGPT bias, most likely due to the rules imposed on human trainers by OpenAI. Our results provide the basis for a fundamental discussion of whether the high quality of recent predictive NLP models can indicate a tool's usefulness to society and how the learning and validation procedures for such systems should be established.","created":"2023-02-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10724v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"A Prompt Pattern Catalog to Enhance Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT","abstract":"Prompt engineering is an increasingly important skill set needed to converse effectively with large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. Prompts are instructions given to an LLM to enforce rules, automate processes, and ensure specific qualities (and quantities) of generated output. Prompts are also a form of programming that can customize the outputs and interactions with an LLM. This paper describes a catalog of prompt engineering techniques presented in pattern form that have been applied to solve common problems when conversing with LLMs. Prompt patterns are a knowledge transfer method analogous to software patterns since they provide reusable solutions to common problems faced in a particular context, i.e., output generation and interaction when working with LLMs. This paper provides the following contributions to research on prompt engineering that apply LLMs to automate software development tasks. First, it provides a framework for documenting patterns for structuring prompts to solve a range of problems so that they can be adapted to different domains. Second, it presents a catalog of patterns that have been applied successfully to improve the outputs of LLM conversations.

{"title":"Combining Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet: Heading towards Evolution or Degradation?","abstract":"In the span of a few months, generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that can generate realistic images or text have taken the Internet by storm, making them one of the technologies with fastest adoption ever. Some of these generative AI tools such as DALL-E, MidJourney, or ChatGPT have gained wide public notoriety. Interestingly, these tools are possible because of the massive amount of data (text and images) available on the Internet. The tools are trained on massive data sets that are scraped from Internet sites. And now, these generative AI tools are creating massive amounts of new data that are being fed into the Internet. Therefore, future versions of generative AI tools will be trained with Internet data that is a mix of original and AI-generated data. As time goes on, a mixture of original data and data generated by different versions of AI tools will populate the Internet. This raises a few intriguing questions: how will future versions of generative AI tools behave when trained on a mixture of real and AI generated data? Will they evolve with the new data sets or degenerate? Will evolution introduce biases in subsequent generations of generative AI tools? In this document, we explore these questions and report some very initial simulation results using a simple image-generation AI tool. These results suggest that the quality of the generated images degrades as more AI-generated data is used for training thus suggesting that generative AI may degenerate. Although these results are preliminary and cannot be generalised without further study, they serve to illustrate the potential issues of the interaction between generative AI and the Internet.","created":"2023-02-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01255v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

Although understanding the benefits and harms of using AI systems requires more time, their rapid and indiscriminate adoption in practice is a reality. Currently, we lack a common framework and language to define and report responsible use of AI for content generation. Prior work proposed guidelines for using AI in specific scenarios (e.g., robotics or medicine) which are not transferable to conducting and reporting scientific research. Our work makes two contributions: First, we propose a three-dimensional model consisting of transparency, integrity, and accountability to \\textit{define} the responsible use of AI. Second, we introduce ``AI Usage Cards'', a standardized way to \\textit{report} the use of AI in scientific research. Our model and cards allow users to reflect on key principles of responsible AI usage.

{"title":"Exploring the Limits of ChatGPT for Query or Aspect-based Text Summarization","abstract":"Text summarization has been a crucial problem in natural language processing (NLP) for several decades. It aims to condense lengthy documents into shorter versions while retaining the most critical information. Various methods have been proposed for text summarization, including extractive and abstractive summarization. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT3 and ChatGPT has recently created significant interest in using these models for text summarization tasks. Recent studies \\cite{goyal2022news, zhang2023benchmarking} have shown that LLMs-generated news summaries are already on par with humans. However, the performance of LLMs for more practical applications like aspect or query-based summaries is underexplored. To fill this gap, we conducted an evaluation of ChatGPT's performance on four widely used benchmark datasets, encompassing diverse summaries from Reddit posts, news articles, dialogue meetings, and stories. Our experiments reveal that ChatGPT's performance is comparable to traditional fine-tuning methods in terms of Rouge scores. Moreover, we highlight some unique differences between ChatGPT-generated summaries and human references, providing valuable insights into the superpower of ChatGPT for diverse text summarization tasks. Our findings call for new directions in this area, and we plan to conduct further research to systematically examine the characteristics of ChatGPT-generated summaries through extensive human evaluation.","created":"2023-02-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08081v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"NL2CMD: An Updated Workflow for Natural Language to Bash Commands Translation","abstract":"Translating natural language into Bash Commands is an emerging research field that has gained attention in recent years. Most efforts have focused on producing more accurate translation models. To the best of our knowledge, only two datasets are available, with one based on the other. Both datasets involve scraping through known data sources (through platforms like stack overflow, crowdsourcing, etc.) and hiring experts to validate and correct either the English text or Bash Commands. This paper provides two contributions to research on synthesizing Bash Commands from scratch. First, we describe a state-of-the-art translation model used to generate Bash Commands from the corresponding English text. Second, we introduce a new NL2CMD dataset that is automatically generated, involves minimal human intervention, and is over six times larger than prior datasets. Since the generation pipeline does not rely on existing Bash Commands, the distribution and types of commands can be custom adjusted. We evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on this task and discuss the potential of using it as a data generator. Our empirical results show how the scale and diversity of our dataset can offer unique opportunities for semantic parsing researchers.","created":"2023-02-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07845v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"A Pilot Evaluation of ChatGPT and DALL-E 2 on Decision Making and Spatial Reasoning","abstract":"We conduct a pilot study selectively evaluating the cognitive abilities (decision making and spatial reasoning) of two recently released generative transformer models, ChatGPT and DALL-E 2. Input prompts were constructed following neutral a priori guidelines, rather than adversarial intent. Post hoc qualitative analysis of the outputs shows that DALL-E 2 is able to generate at least one correct image for each spatial reasoning prompt, but most images generated are incorrect (even though the model seems to have a clear understanding of the objects mentioned in the prompt). Similarly, in evaluating ChatGPT on the rationality axioms developed under the classical Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem, we find that, although it demonstrates some level of rational decision-making, many of its decisions violate at least one of the axioms even under reasonable constructions of preferences, bets, and decision-making prompts. ChatGPT's outputs on such problems generally tended to be unpredictable: even as it made irrational decisions (or employed an incorrect reasoning process) for some simpler decision-making problems, it was able to draw correct conclusions for more complex bet structures. We briefly comment on the nuances and challenges involved in scaling up such a 'cognitive' evaluation or conducting it with a closed set of answer keys ('ground truth'), given that these models are inherently generative and open-ended in responding to prompts.","created":"2023-02-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09068v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"ChatCAD: Interactive Computer-Aided Diagnosis on Medical Image using Large Language Models","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential in clinical applications, providing valuable medical knowledge and advice. For example, a large dialog LLM like ChatGPT has successfully passed part of the US medical licensing exam. However, LLMs currently have difficulty processing images, making it challenging to interpret information from medical images, which are rich in information that supports clinical decisions. On the other hand, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) networks for medical images have seen significant success in the medical field by using advanced deep-learning algorithms to support clinical decision-making. This paper presents a method for integrating LLMs into medical-image CAD networks. The proposed framework uses LLMs to enhance the output of multiple CAD networks, such as diagnosis networks, lesion segmentation networks, and report generation networks, by summarizing and reorganizing the information presented in natural language text format. The goal is to merge the strengths of LLMs' medical domain knowledge and logical reasoning with the vision understanding capability of existing medical-image CAD models to create a more user-friendly and understandable system for patients compared to conventional CAD systems. In the future, LLM's medical knowledge can be also used to improve the performance of vision-based medical-image CAD models.","created":"2023-02-14","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07257v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

Authoring of open educational resources and hint content within adaptive tutoring systems is labor intensive. Should LLMs like ChatGPT produce educational content on par with human-authored content, the implications would be significant for further scaling of computer tutoring system approaches. In this paper, we conduct the first learning gain evaluation of ChatGPT by comparing the efficacy of its hints with hints authored by human tutors with 77 participants across two algebra topic areas, Elementary Algebra and Intermediate Algebra. We find that 70% of hints produced by ChatGPT passed our manual quality checks and that both human and ChatGPT conditions produced positive learning gains. However, gains were only statistically significant for human tutor created hints. Learning gains from human-created hints were substantially and statistically significantly higher than ChatGPT hints in both topic areas, though ChatGPT participants in the Intermediate Algebra experiment were near ceiling and not even with the control at pre-test. We discuss the limitations of our study and suggest several future directions for the field.

According to the importance order, the transmitter then performs an unequal error protection transmission strategy to make the transmission of essential words more reliable. Unlike the existing semantic communication schemes, SCOI is compatible with existing source-channel separation designs and can be directly embedded into current communication systems.

In this paper, we present a collaborative design framework that combines interactive evolution and large language models to simulate the typical human design process. We use the former to exploit users' feedback for selecting the most promising ideas and large language models for a very complex creative task -- the recombination and variation of ideas. In our framework, the process starts with a brief and a set of candidate designs, either generated using a language model or proposed by the users. Next, users collaborate on the design process by providing feedback to an interactive genetic algorithm that selects, recombines, and mutates the most promising designs.

{"title":"Will ChatGPT get you caught? Rethinking of Plagiarism Detection","abstract":"The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and its impact on education has been a topic of growing concern in recent years. The new generation AI systems such as chatbots have become more accessible on the Internet and stronger in terms of capabilities. The use of chatbots, particularly ChatGPT, for generating academic essays at schools and colleges has sparked fears among scholars. This study aims to explore the originality of contents produced by one of the most popular AI chatbots, ChatGPT. To this end, two popular plagiarism detection tools were used to evaluate the originality of 50 essays generated by ChatGPT on various topics. Our results manifest that ChatGPT has a great potential to generate sophisticated text outputs without being well caught by the plagiarism check software. In other words, ChatGPT can create content on many topics with high originality as if they were written by someone. These findings align with the recent concerns about students using chatbots for an easy shortcut to success with minimal or no effort. Moreover, ChatGPT was asked to verify if the essays were generated by itself, as an additional measure of plagiarism check, and it showed superior performance compared to the traditional plagiarism-detection tools. The paper discusses the need for institutions to consider appropriate measures to mitigate potential plagiarism issues and advise on the ongoing debate surrounding the impact of AI technology on education.

Detailed observations of the present contents of the universe are consistent with the Cosmological Constant Lambda and Cold Dark Matter model, subject to some unresolved inconsistencies ('tensions') among observations of the Hubble Constant and the clumpiness factor. To understand these issues further, large surveys of billions of galaxies and other probes require new statistical approaches. In recent years the power of ML, and in particular 'Deep Learning', has been demonstrated for object classification, photometric redshifts, anomaly detection, enhanced simulations, and inference of cosmological parameters. It is argued that the more traditional 'shallow learning' (i.e. with pre-processing feature extraction) is actually quite deep, as it brings in human knowledge, while 'deep learning' might be perceived as a black box, unless supplemented by explainability tools. The 'killer applications' of ML for Cosmology are still to come. New ways to train the next generation of scientists for the Data Intensive Science challenges ahead are also discussed.

{"title":"A Multitask, Multilingual, Multimodal Evaluation of ChatGPT on Reasoning, Hallucination, and Interactivity","abstract":"This paper proposes a framework for quantitatively evaluating interactive LLMs such as ChatGPT using publicly available data sets. We carry out an extensive technical evaluation of ChatGPT using 23 data sets covering 8 different common NLP application tasks. We evaluate the multitask, multilingual and multi-modal aspects of ChatGPT based on these data sets and a newly designed multimodal dataset. We find that ChatGPT outperforms LLMs with zero-shot learning on most tasks and even outperforms fine-tuned models on some tasks. We find that it is better at understanding non-Latin script languages than generating them. It is able to generate multimodal content from textual prompts, via an intermediate code generation step. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT is 63.41% accurate on average in 10 different reasoning categories under logical reasoning, non-textual reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, hence making it an unreliable reasoner. It is, for example, better at deductive than inductive reasoning. ChatGPT suffers from hallucination problems like other LLMs and it generates more extrinsic hallucinations from its parametric memory as it does not have access to an external knowledge base. Finally, the interactive feature of ChatGPT enables human collaboration with the underlying LLM to improve its performance, i.e, 8% ROUGE-1 on summarization and 2% ChrF++ on machine translation, in a multi-turn \"prompt engineering\" fashion. We also release codebase for evaluation set extraction.","created":"2023-02-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04023v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"Reliable Natural Language Understanding with Large Language Models and Answer Set Programming","abstract":"Humans understand language by extracting information (meaning) from sentences, combining it with existing commonsense knowledge, and then performing reasoning to draw conclusions. While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT are able to leverage patterns in the text to solve a variety of NLP tasks, they fall short in problems that require reasoning. They also cannot reliably explain the answers generated for a given question. In order to emulate humans better, we propose STAR, a framework that combines LLMs with Answer Set Programming (ASP). We show how LLMs can be used to effectively extract knowledge -- represented as predicates -- from language. Goal-directed ASP is then employed to reliably reason over this knowledge. We apply the STAR framework to three different NLU tasks requiring reasoning: qualitative reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and goal-directed conversation. Our experiments reveal that STAR is able to bridge the gap of reasoning in NLU tasks, leading to significant performance improvements, especially for smaller LLMs, i.e., LLMs with a smaller number of parameters. NLU applications developed using the STAR framework are also explainable: along with the predicates generated, a justification in the form of a proof tree can be produced for a given output.","created":"2023-02-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03780v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"ChatGPT and Software Testing Education: Promises & Perils","abstract":"Over the past decade, predictive language modeling for code has proven to be a valuable tool for enabling new forms of automation for developers. More recently, we have seen the advent of general purpose \"large language models\", based on neural transformer architectures, that have been trained on massive datasets of human written text spanning code and natural language. However, despite the demonstrated representational power of such models, interacting with them has historically been constrained to specific task settings, limiting their general applicability. Many of these limitations were recently overcome with the introduction of ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI and trained to operate as a conversational agent, enabling it to answer questions and respond to a wide variety of commands from end users. The introduction of models, such as ChatGPT, has already spurred fervent discussion from educators, ranging from fear that students could use these AI tools to circumvent learning, to excitement about the new types of learning opportunities that they might unlock. However, given the nascent nature of these tools, we currently lack fundamental knowledge related to how well they perform in different educational settings, and the potential promise (or danger) that they might pose to traditional forms of instruction. As such, in this paper, we examine how well ChatGPT performs when tasked with answering common questions in a popular software testing curriculum. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT can provide correct or partially correct answers in 55.6% of cases, provide correct or partially correct explanations of answers in 53.0% of cases, and that prompting the tool in a shared question context leads to a marginally higher rate of correct responses. Based on these findings, we discuss the potential promises and perils related to the use of ChatGPT by students and instructors.","created":"2023-02-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03287v3","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

We tailor regulatory duties to these different actors along the value chain and suggest four strategies to ensure that LGAIMs are trustworthy and deployed for the benefit of society at large. Rules in the AI Act and other direct regulation must match the specificities of pre-trained models. In particular, regulation should focus on concrete high-risk applications, and not the pre-trained model itself, and should include (i) obligations regarding transparency and (ii) risk management.

Research in Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) has contributed towards the development of such techniques. However, the implementation of workable NLIs has always been challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, as well as in consequence of unclear and poorly written user queries which pose problems for existing language models in discerning user intent. Instead of pursuing the usual path of developing new iterations of language models, this study uniquely proposes leveraging the advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 to convert free-form natural language directly into code for appropriate visualisations. This paper presents a novel system, Chat2VIS, which takes advantage of the capabilities of LLMs and demonstrates how, with effective prompt engineering, the complex problem of language understanding can be solved more efficiently, resulting in simpler and more accurate end-to-end solutions than prior approaches. Chat2VIS shows that LLMs together with the proposed prompts offer a reliable approach to rendering visualisations from natural language queries, even when queries are highly misspecified and underspecified. This solution also presents a significant reduction in costs for the development of NLI systems, while attaining greater visualisation inference abilities compared to traditional NLP approaches that use hand-crafted grammar rules and tailored models. This study also presents how LLM prompts can be constructed in a way that preserves data security and privacy while being generalisable to different datasets.

{"title":"Can ChatGPT Write a Good Boolean Query for Systematic Review Literature Search?","abstract":"Systematic reviews are comprehensive reviews of the literature for a highly focused research question. These reviews are often treated as the highest form of evidence in evidence-based medicine, and are the key strategy to answer research questions in the medical field. To create a high-quality systematic review, complex Boolean queries are often constructed to retrieve studies for the review topic. However, it often takes a long time for systematic review researchers to construct a high quality systematic review Boolean query, and often the resulting queries are far from effective. Poor queries may lead to biased or invalid reviews, because they missed to retrieve key evidence, or to extensive increase in review costs, because they retrieved too many irrelevant studies. Recent advances in Transformer-based generative models have shown great potential to effectively follow instructions from users and generate answers based on the instructions being made. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of the latest of such models, ChatGPT, in generating effective Boolean queries for systematic review literature search. Through a number of extensive experiments on standard test collections for the task, we find that ChatGPT is capable of generating queries that lead to high search precision, although trading-off this for recall. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of ChatGPT in generating effective Boolean queries for systematic review literature search. The ability of ChatGPT to follow complex instructions and generate queries with high precision makes it a valuable tool for researchers conducting systematic reviews, particularly for rapid reviews where time is a constraint and often trading-off higher precision for lower recall is acceptable.","created":"2023-02-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03495v3","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

The results showed that while the responses and translation abilities of ChatGPT are remarkable, they still fall short of what a typical human reaction would be.","created":"2023-02-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12038v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Mathematical Capabilities of ChatGPT","abstract":"We investigate the mathematical capabilities of ChatGPT by testing it on publicly available datasets, as well as hand-crafted ones, and measuring its performance against other models trained on a mathematical corpus, such as Minerva. We also test whether ChatGPT can be a useful assistant to professional mathematicians by emulating various use cases that come up in the daily professional activities of mathematicians (question answering, theorem searching). In contrast to formal mathematics, where large databases of formal proofs are available (e.g., the Lean Mathematical Library), current datasets of natural-language mathematics, used to benchmark language models, only cover elementary mathematics. We address this issue by introducing a new dataset: GHOSTS. It is the first natural-language dataset made and curated by working researchers in mathematics that (1) aims to cover graduate-level mathematics and (2) provides a holistic overview of the mathematical capabilities of language models. We benchmark ChatGPT on GHOSTS and evaluate performance against fine-grained criteria. We make this new dataset publicly available to assist a community-driven comparison of ChatGPT with (future) large language models in terms of advanced mathematical comprehension. We conclude that contrary to many positive reports in the media (a potential case of selection bias), ChatGPT's mathematical abilities are significantly below those of an average mathematics graduate student. Our results show that ChatGPT often understands the question but fails to provide correct solutions. Hence, if your goal is to use it to pass a university exam, you would be better off copying from your average peer!","created":"2023-01-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13867v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Numeracy from Literacy: Data Science as an Emergent Skill from Large Language Models","abstract":"Large language models (LLM) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and GPT-3 offer unique testbeds for exploring the translation challenges of turning literacy into numeracy. Previous publicly-available transformer models from eighteen months prior and 1000 times smaller failed to provide basic arithmetic. The statistical analysis of four complex datasets described here combines arithmetic manipulations that cannot be memorized or encoded by simple rules. The work examines whether next-token prediction succeeds from sentence completion into the realm of actual numerical understanding. For example, the work highlights cases for descriptive statistics on in-memory datasets that the LLM initially loads from memory or generates randomly using python libraries. The resulting exploratory data analysis showcases the model's capabilities to group by or pivot categorical sums, infer feature importance, derive correlations, and predict unseen test cases using linear regression. To extend the model's testable range, the research deletes and appends random rows such that recall alone cannot explain emergent numeracy.","created":"2023-01-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13382v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Conversational Automated Program Repair","abstract":"Automated Program Repair (APR) can help developers automatically generate patches for bugs. Due to the impressive performance obtained using Large Pre-Trained Language Models (LLMs) on many code related tasks, researchers have started to directly use LLMs for APR. However, prior approaches simply repeatedly sample the LLM given the same constructed input/prompt created from the original buggy code, which not only leads to generating the same incorrect patches repeatedly but also miss the critical information in testcases. To address these limitations, we propose conversational APR, a new paradigm for program repair that alternates between patch generation and validation in a conversational manner. In conversational APR, we iteratively build the input to the model by combining previously generated patches with validation feedback. As such, we leverage the long-term context window of LLMs to not only avoid generating previously incorrect patches but also incorporate validation feedback to help the model understand the semantic meaning of the program under test. We evaluate 10 different LLM including the newly developed ChatGPT model to demonstrate the improvement of conversational APR over the prior LLM for APR approach.","created":"2023-01-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13246v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Exploring AI Ethics of ChatGPT: A Diagnostic Analysis","abstract":"Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) have permitted the synthesis and comprehension of coherent text in an open-ended way, therefore translating the theoretical algorithms into practical applications. The large language-model (LLM) has significantly impacted businesses such as report summarization softwares and copywriters. Observations indicate, however, that LLMs may exhibit social prejudice and toxicity, posing ethical and societal dangers of consequences resulting from irresponsibility. Large-scale benchmarks for accountable LLMs should consequently be developed. Although several empirical investigations reveal the existence of a few ethical difficulties in advanced LLMs, there is no systematic examination and user study of the ethics of current LLMs use. To further educate future efforts on constructing ethical LLMs responsibly, we perform a qualitative research method on OpenAI's ChatGPT to better understand the practical features of ethical dangers in recent LLMs. We analyze ChatGPT comprehensively from four perspectives: 1) \\textit{Bias} 2) \\textit{Reliability} 3) \\textit{Robustness} 4) \\textit{Toxicity}. In accordance with our stated viewpoints, we empirically benchmark ChatGPT on multiple sample datasets. We find that a significant number of ethical risks cannot be addressed by existing benchmarks, and hence illustrate them via additional case studies. In addition, we examine the implications of our findings on the AI ethics of ChatGPT, as well as future problems and practical design considerations for LLMs. We believe that our findings may give light on future efforts to determine and mitigate the ethical hazards posed by machines in LLM applications.","created":"2023-01-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12867v3","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"ChatGPT or Human? Detect and Explain. Explaining Decisions of Machine Learning Model for Detecting Short ChatGPT-generated Text","abstract":"ChatGPT has the ability to generate grammatically flawless and seemingly-human replies to different types of questions from various domains. The number of its users and of its applications is growing at an unprecedented rate. Unfortunately, use and abuse come hand in hand. In this paper, we study whether a machine learning model can be effectively trained to accurately distinguish between original human and seemingly human (that is, ChatGPT-generated) text, especially when this text is short. Furthermore, we employ an explainable artificial intelligence framework to gain insight into the reasoning behind the model trained to differentiate between ChatGPT-generated and human-generated text. The goal is to analyze model's decisions and determine if any specific patterns or characteristics can be identified. Our study focuses on short online reviews, conducting two experiments comparing human-generated and ChatGPT-generated text. The first experiment involves ChatGPT text generated from custom queries, while the second experiment involves text generated by rephrasing original human-generated reviews. We fine-tune a Transformer-based model and use it to make predictions, which are then explained using SHAP. We compare our model with a perplexity score-based approach and find that disambiguation between human and ChatGPT-generated reviews is more challenging for the ML model when using rephrased text. However, our proposed approach still achieves an accuracy of 79%. Using explainability, we observe that ChatGPT's writing is polite, without specific details, using fancy and atypical vocabulary, impersonal, and typically it does not express feelings.","created":"2023-01-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13852v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

With multiple possible solutions available, each with its own set of trade-offs, it is essential for programmers to evaluate the various options and select the one that best suits the specific requirements and constraints of a project. Whether it is choosing from a range of libraries, weighing the pros and cons of different architecture and design solutions, or finding unique ways to fulfill user requirements, the ability to think creatively is crucial for making informed decisions that will result in efficient and effective software. However, the interfaces of current chatbot tools for programmers, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot, are optimized for presenting a single solution, even for complex queries. While other solutions can be requested, they are not displayed by default and are not intuitive to access.

Just how human-like are these responses when it comes to dialogues about physics, in particular about the standard content of introductory physics courses? This study explores that question by having ChatGTP, the pre-eminent language model in 2023, work through representative assessment content of an actual calculus-based physics course and grading the responses in the same way human responses would be graded.

It then investigates the production of truth in InstructGPT, a large language model, highlighting how data harvesting, model architectures, and social feedback mechanisms weave together disparate understandings of veracity. It conceptualizes this performance as an operationalization of truth, where distinct, often conflicting claims are smoothly synthesized and confidently presented into truth-statements. We argue that these same logics and inconsistencies play out in Instruct's successor, ChatGPT, reiterating truth as a non-trivial problem. We suggest that enriching sociality and thickening \"reality\" are two promising vectors for enhancing the truth-evaluating capacities of future language models.

Participants: A US representative sample of 430 study participants aged 18 and above. 53.2% of respondents analyzed were women; their average age was 47.1. Exposure: Ten representative non-administrative patient-provider interactions were extracted from the EHR. Patients' questions were placed in ChatGPT with a request for the chatbot to respond using approximately the same word count as the human provider's response. In the survey, each patient's question was followed by a provider- or ChatGPT-generated response. Participants were informed that five responses were provider-generated and five were chatbot-generated. Participants were asked, and incentivized financially, to correctly identify the response source. Participants were also asked about their trust in chatbots' functions in patient-provider communication, using a Likert scale of 1-5. Results: The correct classification of responses ranged between 49.0% to 85.7% for different questions. On average, chatbot responses were correctly identified 65.5% of the time, and provider responses were correctly distinguished 65.1% of the time. On average, responses toward patients' trust in chatbots' functions were weakly positive (mean Likert score: 3.4), with lower trust as the health-related complexity of the task in questions increased. Conclusions: ChatGPT responses to patient questions were weakly distinguishable from provider responses. Laypeople appear to trust the use of chatbots to answer lower risk health questions.","created":"2023-01-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10035v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"An Analysis of the Automatic Bug Fixing Performance of ChatGPT","abstract":"To support software developers in finding and fixing software bugs, several automated program repair techniques have been introduced. Given a test suite, standard methods usually either synthesize a repair, or navigate a search space of software edits to find test-suite passing variants. Recent program repair methods are based on deep learning approaches. One of these novel methods, which is not primarily intended for automated program repair, but is still suitable for it, is ChatGPT. The bug fixing performance of ChatGPT, however, is so far unclear. Therefore, in this paper we evaluate ChatGPT on the standard bug fixing benchmark set, QuixBugs, and compare the performance with the results of several other approaches reported in the literature. We find that ChatGPT's bug fixing performance is competitive to the common deep learning approaches CoCoNut and Codex and notably better than the results reported for the standard program repair approaches. In contrast to previous approaches, ChatGPT offers a dialogue system through which further information, e.g., the expected output for a certain input or an observed error message, can be entered. By providing such hints to ChatGPT, its success rate can be further increased, fixing 31 out of 40 bugs, outperforming state-of-the-art.","created":"2023-01-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08653v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

Comparison Corpus, Evaluation, and Detection","abstract":"The introduction of ChatGPT has garnered widespread attention in both academic and industrial communities. ChatGPT is able to respond effectively to a wide range of human questions, providing fluent and comprehensive answers that significantly surpass previous public chatbots in terms of security and usefulness. On one hand, people are curious about how ChatGPT is able to achieve such strength and how far it is from human experts. On the other hand, people are starting to worry about the potential negative impacts that large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT could have on society, such as fake news, plagiarism, and social security issues. In this work, we collected tens of thousands of comparison responses from both human experts and ChatGPT, with questions ranging from open-domain, financial, medical, legal, and psychological areas. We call the collected dataset the Human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus (HC3).

{"title":"Modeling Label Semantics Improves Activity Recognition","abstract":"Human activity recognition (HAR) aims to classify sensory time series into different activities, with wide applications in activity tracking, healthcare, human computer interaction, etc. Existing HAR works improve recognition performance by designing more complicated feature extraction methods, but they neglect the label semantics by simply treating labels as integer IDs. We find that many activities in the current HAR datasets have shared label names, e.g., \"open door\" and \"open fridge\", \"walk upstairs\" and \"walk downstairs\". Through some exploratory analysis, we find that such shared structure in activity names also maps to similarity in the input features. To this end, we design a sequence-to-sequence framework to decode the label name semantics rather than classifying labels as integer IDs. Our proposed method decomposes learning activities into learning shared tokens (\"open\", \"walk\"), which is easier than learning the joint distribution (\"open fridge\", \"walk upstairs\") and helps transfer learning to activities with insufficient data samples. For datasets originally without shared tokens in label names, we also offer an automated method, using OpenAI's ChatGPT, to generate shared actions and objects. Extensive experiments on seven HAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

{"title":"Transformers Go for the LOLs: Generating (Humourous) Titles from Scientific Abstracts End-to-End","abstract":"We consider the end-to-end abstract-to-title generation problem, exploring seven recent transformer based models (including ChatGPT) fine-tuned on more than 30k abstract-title pairs from NLP and machine learning venues. As an extension, we also consider the harder problem of generating humorous paper titles. For the latter, we compile the first large-scale humor annotated dataset for scientific papers in the NLP/ML domains, comprising almost 2.5k titles. We evaluate all models using human and automatic metrics. Our human evaluation suggests that our best end-to-end system performs similarly to human authors (but arguably slightly worse). Generating funny titles is more difficult, however, and our automatic systems clearly underperform relative to humans and often learn dataset artefacts of humor. Finally, ChatGPT, without any fine-tuning, performs on the level of our best fine-tuned system.","created":"2022-12-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10522v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"ByGPT5: End-to-End Style-conditioned Poetry Generation with Token-free Language Models","abstract":"State-of-the-art poetry generation systems are often complex. They either consist of task-specific model pipelines, incorporate prior knowledge in the form of manually created constraints or both. In contrast, end-to-end models would not suffer from the overhead of having to model prior knowledge and could learn the nuances of poetry from data alone, reducing the degree of human supervision required. In this work, we investigate end-to-end poetry generation conditioned on styles such as rhyme, meter, and alliteration. We identify and address lack of training data and mismatching tokenization algorithms as possible limitations of past attempts. In particular, we successfully pre-train and release ByGPT5, a new token-free decoder-only language model, and fine-tune it on a large custom corpus of English and German quatrains annotated with our styles. We show that ByGPT5 outperforms other models such as mT5, ByT5, GPT-2 and ChatGPT, while also being more parameter efficient and performing favorably compared to humans. In addition, we analyze its runtime performance and introspect the model's understanding of style conditions. We make our code, models, and datasets publicly available.","created":"2022-12-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10474v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Are Deep Neural Networks SMARTer than Second Graders?","abstract":"Recent times have witnessed an increasing number of applications of deep neural networks towards solving tasks that require superior cognitive abilities, e.g., playing Go, generating art, question answering (such as ChatGPT), etc. Such a dramatic progress raises the question: how generalizable are neural networks in solving problems that demand broad skills? To answer this question, we propose SMART: a Simple Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task and the associated SMART-101 dataset, for evaluating the abstraction, deduction, and generalization abilities of neural networks in solving visuo-linguistic puzzles designed specifically for children in the 6-8 age group. Our dataset consists of 101 unique puzzles; each puzzle comprises a picture and a question, and their solution needs a mix of several elementary skills, including arithmetic, algebra, and spatial reasoning, among others. To scale our dataset towards training deep neural networks, we programmatically generate entirely new instances for each puzzle while retaining their solution algorithm. To benchmark the performance on the SMART-101 dataset, we propose a vision and language meta-learning model using varied state-of-the-art backbone neural networks. Our experiments reveal that while powerful deep models offer reasonable performances on puzzles that they are trained on, they are not better than random accuracy when analyzed for generalization. We also evaluate the recent ChatGPT large language model on a subset of our dataset and find that while ChatGPT produces convincing reasoning abilities, the answers are often incorrect.","created":"2022-12-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09993v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"Million-scale Object Detection with Large Vision Model","abstract":"Over the past few years, there has been growing interest in developing a broad, universal, and general-purpose computer vision system. Such a system would have the potential to solve a wide range of vision tasks simultaneously, without being restricted to a specific problem or data domain. This is crucial for practical, real-world computer vision applications. In this study, we focus on the million-scale multi-domain universal object detection problem, which presents several challenges, including cross-dataset category label duplication, label conflicts, and the need to handle hierarchical taxonomies. Furthermore, there is an ongoing challenge in the field to find a resource-efficient way to leverage large pre-trained vision models for million-scale cross-dataset object detection. To address these challenges, we introduce our approach to label handling, hierarchy-aware loss design, and resource-efficient model training using a pre-trained large model. Our method was ranked second in the object detection track of the Robust Vision Challenge 2022 (RVC 2022). We hope that our detailed study will serve as a useful reference and alternative approach for similar problems in the computer vision community.

This capacity raises concerns about the potential use of ChatGPT as a tool for academic misconduct in online exams. The study found that ChatGPT is capable of exhibiting critical thinking skills and generating highly realistic text with minimal input, making it a potential threat to the integrity of online exams, particularly in tertiary education settings where such exams are becoming more prevalent. Returning to invigilated and oral exams could form part of the solution, while using advanced proctoring techniques and AI-text output detectors may be effective in addressing this issue, they are not likely to be foolproof solutions. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of large language models like ChatGPT and to devise strategies for combating the risk of cheating using these tools.

With varying success, the experimental prompts generate examples of keyloggers, logic bombs, obfuscated worms, and payment-fulfilled ransomware. The empirical results illustrate cases that support the broad gain of functionality, including self-replication and self-modification, evasion, and strategic understanding of complex cybersecurity goals.

ChatGPT developed by OpenAI is one such implementation of a large, pre-trained language model that has gained immense popularity among early adopters, where certain users go to the extent of characterizing it as a disruptive technology in many domains. Understanding such early adopters' sentiments is important because it can provide insights into the potential success or failure of the technology, as well as its strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we conduct a mixed-method study using 10,732 tweets from early ChatGPT users. We first use topic modelling to identify the main topics and then perform an in-depth qualitative sentiment analysis of each topic. Our results show that the majority of the early adopters have expressed overwhelmingly positive sentiments related to topics such as Disruptions to software development, Entertainment and exercising creativity. Only a limited percentage of users expressed concerns about issues such as the potential for misuse of ChatGPT, especially regarding topics such as Impact on educational aspects. We discuss these findings by providing specific examples for each topic and then detail implications related to addressing these concerns for both researchers and users.","created":"2022-12-12","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05856v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

We score the original and generated content against the OpenAI GPT-2 Output Detector from 2019, and establish multiple cases where the generated content proves original and undetectable (98%).

However, the successful application of AI is dependent on the availability of high-quality data, the addressing of ethical concerns, and the recognition of the limitations of AI-based approaches. In this article, the benefits, challenges and drawbacks of AI in this field are reviewed, and possible strategies and approaches for overcoming the present obstacles are proposed. The use of data augmentation, explainable AI, and the integration of AI with traditional experimental methods, as well as the potential advantages of AI in pharmaceutical research are also discussed.

{"title":"The European AI Liability Directives -- Critique of a Half-Hearted Approach and Lessons for the Future","abstract":"As ChatGPT et al. conquer the world, the optimal liability framework for AI systems remains an unsolved problem across the globe. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive and a revision of the Product Liability Directive. They constitute the final cornerstone of EU AI regulation. Crucially, the liability proposals and the EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a Brussels Effect in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and beyond.   This paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the Commission proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality. Hence, second, the article suggests amendments, which are collected in an Annex at the end of the paper. Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. This includes: a comprehensive framework for AI liability; provisions to support innovation; an extension to non-discrimination/algorithmic fairness, as well as explainable AI; and sustainability. I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI and XAI, but potentially also sustainable AI (SAI).","created":"2022-11-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13960v5","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"What would Harry say? Building Dialogue Agents for Characters in a Story","abstract":"We have a Christmas gift for Harry Potter fans all over the world. In this paper, we present Harry Potter Dialogue (HPD), a dataset that helps train Harry Potter-like dialogue agents. Such a task is typically viewed as a variant of personalized dialogue agents, but they differ significantly in three respects: 1) Harry lived in a virtual world of wizards, thus, real-world commonsense may not apply to Harry's conversations; 2) Harry's behavior is strongly linked to background information in conversations: the scene, its attributes and its relationship to other speakers; and 3) Such backgrounds are dynamically altered as the storyline goes on. The HPD dataset, as the first dataset to facilitate the study of dialogue agent construction for characters within a story, provides rich contextual information about each dialogue session such as scenes, character attributes, and relations. More importantly, all the background information will change over the course of the story. In addition, HPD could support both dialogue generation and retrieval tasks. We evaluate baselines such as Dialog-GPT and BOB to determine the extent to which they can generate Harry Potter-like responses. The experimental results disappoint us in that although the generated responses are fluent, they still seem out of character for Harry. Besides, we validate the current most robust dialogue agent, ChatGPT, which also can't generate plausible Harry-Potter-like responses in some cases, either.

On the Limits of Social Intelligence in Large LMs","abstract":"Social intelligence and Theory of Mind (ToM), i.e., the ability to reason about the different mental states, intents, and reactions of all people involved, allow humans to effectively navigate and understand everyday social interactions. As NLP systems are used in increasingly complex social situations, their ability to grasp social dynamics becomes crucial. In this work, we examine the open question of social intelligence and Theory of Mind in modern NLP systems from an empirical and theory-based perspective. We show that one of today's largest language models (GPT-3; Brown et al., 2020) lacks this kind of social intelligence out-of-the box, using two tasks: SocialIQa (Sap et al., 2019), which measures models' ability to understand intents and reactions of participants of social interactions, and ToMi (Le et al., 2019), which measures whether models can infer mental states and realities of participants of situations. Our results show that models struggle substantially at these Theory of Mind tasks, with well-below-human accuracies of 55% and 60% on SocialIQa and ToMi, respectively. To conclude, we draw on theories from pragmatics to contextualize this shortcoming of large language models, by examining the limitations stemming from their data, neural architecture, and training paradigms. Challenging the prevalent narrative that only scale is needed, we posit that person-centric NLP approaches might be more effective towards neural Theory of Mind.   In our updated version, we also analyze newer instruction tuned and RLFH models for neural ToM. We find that even ChatGPT and GPT-4 do not display emergent Theory of Mind; strikingly even GPT-4 performs only 60% accuracy on the ToMi questions related to mental states and realities.","created":"2022-10-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13312v2","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"SparseFormer: Sparse Visual Recognition via Limited Latent Tokens","abstract":"Human visual recognition is a sparse process, where only a few salient visual cues are attended to rather than traversing every detail uniformly. However, most current vision networks follow a dense paradigm, processing every single visual unit (e.g,, pixel or patch) in a uniform manner. In this paper, we challenge this dense paradigm and present a new method, coined SparseFormer, to imitate human's sparse visual recognition in an end-to-end manner. SparseFormer learns to represent images using a highly limited number of tokens (down to 49) in the latent space with sparse feature sampling procedure instead of processing dense units in the original pixel space. Therefore, SparseFormer circumvents most of dense operations on the image space and has much lower computational costs. Experiments on the ImageNet classification benchmark dataset show that SparseFormer achieves performance on par with canonical or well-established models while offering better accuracy-throughput tradeoff. Moreover, the design of our network can be easily extended to the video classification with promising performance at lower computational costs. We hope that our work can provide an alternative way for visual modeling and inspire further research on sparse neural architectures.

In this work, we present an automatic system that removes clutter from 3D scenes and inpaints with coherent geometry and texture. We propose techniques for its two key components: 3D segmentation from shared properties and 3D inpainting, both of which are important porblems. The definition of 3D scene clutter (frequently-moving objects) is not well captured by commonly-studied object categories in computer vision. To tackle the lack of well-defined clutter annotations, we group noisy fine-grained labels, leverage virtual rendering, and impose an instance-level area-sensitive loss. Once clutter is removed, we inpaint geometry and texture in the resulting holes by merging inpainted RGB-D images. This requires novel voting and pruning strategies that guarantee multi-view consistency across individually inpainted images for mesh reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNet and Matterport dataset show that our method outperforms baselines for clutter segmentation and 3D inpainting, both visually and quantitatively.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03763v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

Existing question synthesis methods pre-trained question generation (QG) systems on reading comprehension datasets with text descriptions as inputs. However, QG models only learn to ask association questions (e.g., ``what is someone doing...'') and result in inferior performance due to the poor transfer of association knowledge to CVidQA, which focuses on causal questions like ``why is someone doing ...''. Observing this, we proposed to exploit causal knowledge to generate question-answer pairs, and proposed a novel framework, Causal Knowledge Extraction from Language Models (CaKE-LM), leveraging causal commonsense knowledge from language models to tackle CVidQA. To extract knowledge from LMs, CaKE-LM generates causal questions containing two events with one triggering another (e.g., ``score a goal'' triggers ``soccer player kicking ball'') by prompting LM with the action (soccer player kicking ball) to retrieve the intention (to score a goal). CaKE-LM significantly outperforms conventional methods by 4% to 6% of zero-shot CVidQA accuracy on NExT-QA and Causal-VidQA datasets.

{"title":"Did the Universe Reheat After Recombination?","abstract":"A key assumption of the standard cosmological model is that the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation scales with cosmological redshift $z$ as $T_{\\rm CMB}(z) \\propto (1+z)$ at all times after recombination at $z_\\star \\simeq 1090$. However, this assumption has only been precisely tested at $z \\lesssim 3$. Here, we consider cosmological models with post-recombination reheating (PRR), in which the CMB monopole temperature abruptly increases due to energy injection after last scattering. Such a scenario can potentially resolve tensions between inferences of the current cosmic expansion rate (the Hubble constant, $H_0$). We consider an explicit model in which a metastable sub-component of dark matter (DM) decays to Standard Model photons, whose spectral energy distribution is assumed to be close to that of the CMB blackbody. A fit to Planck CMB anisotropy, COBE/FIRAS CMB monopole, and SH0ES distance-ladder measurements yields $H_0 = 71.2 \\pm 1.1$ km/s/Mpc, matter fluctuation amplitude $S_8 = 0.774 \\pm 0.018$, and CMB temperature increase $\\delta T_{\\rm CMB} = 0.109^{+0.033}_{-0.044}$ K, which is sourced by DM decay at $z \\gtrsim 10$. However, matter density constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation and supernovae data highly constrain this scenario, with a joint fit to all datasets yielding $H_0 = 68.69 \\pm 0.35$ km/s/Mpc, $S_8 = 0.8035 \\pm 0.0081$, and $\\delta T_{\\rm CMB} < 0.0342$ K (95% CL upper limit). These bounds can be weakened if additional dark relativistic species are present in the early universe, yielding higher $H_0$. We conclude that current data disfavor models with significant PRR solely through its impact on background and linear-theory observables, completely independent of CMB spectral distortion constraints. However, a small amount of such energy injection could play a role in restoring cosmological concordance.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03750v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

Differentially private mechanisms can be optimized for queries of interest in the energy sector, with provable privacy and accuracy trade-offs, and can help design differentially private databases for further analysis and research.

The consequences impacting targeted individuals and institutions can be dire. In this work, we study the evolutions of deep learning architectures, particularly CNNs and Transformers. We identified eight promising deep learning architectures, designed and developed our deepfake detection models and conducted experiments over well-established deepfake datasets. These datasets included the latest second and third generation deepfake datasets. We evaluated the effectiveness of our developed single model detectors in deepfake detection and cross datasets evaluations.

{"title":"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Modular Multi-Object Navigation","abstract":"Our work focuses on the Multi-Object Navigation (MultiON) task, where an agent needs to navigate to multiple objects in a given sequence. We systematically investigate the inherent modularity of this task by dividing our approach to contain four modules: (a) an object detection module trained to identify objects from RGB images, (b) a map building module to build a semantic map of the observed objects, (c) an exploration module enabling the agent to explore its surroundings, and finally (d) a navigation module to move to identified target objects. We focus on the navigation and the exploration modules in this work. We show that we can effectively leverage a PointGoal navigation model in the MultiON task instead of learning to navigate from scratch. Our experiments show that a PointGoal agent-based navigation module outperforms analytical path planning on the MultiON task. We also compare exploration strategies and surprisingly find that a random exploration strategy significantly outperforms more advanced exploration methods. We additionally create MultiON 2.0, a new large-scale dataset as a test-bed for our approach.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03696v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Sound Dynamic Deadlock Prediction in Linear Time","abstract":"Deadlocks are one of the most notorious concurrency bugs, and significant research has focused on detecting them efficiently. Dynamic predictive analyses work by observing concurrent executions, and reason about alternative interleavings that can witness concurrency bugs. Such techniques offer scalability and sound bug reports, and have emerged as an effective approach for concurrency bug detection, such as data races. Effective dynamic deadlock prediction, however, has proven a challenging task, as no deadlock predictor currently meets the requirements of soundness, high-precision, and efficiency. In this paper, we first formally establish that this tradeoff is unavoidable, by showing that (a) sound and complete deadlock prediction is intractable, in general, and (b) even the seemingly simpler task of determining the presence of potential deadlocks, which often serve as unsound witnesses for actual predictable deadlocks, is intractable. The main contribution of this work is a new class of predictable deadlocks, called sync(hronization)-preserving deadlocks. Informally, these are deadlocks that can be predicted by reordering the observed execution while preserving the relative order of conflicting critical sections. We present two algorithms for sound deadlock prediction based on this notion. Our first algorithm SyncPDOffline detects all sync-preserving deadlocks, with running time that is linear per abstract deadlock pattern, a novel notion also introduced in this work. Our second algorithm SyncPDOnline predicts all sync-preserving deadlocks that involve two threads in a strictly online fashion, runs in overall linear time, and is better suited for a runtime monitoring setting. We implemented both our algorithms and evaluated their ability to perform offline and online deadlock-prediction on a large dataset of standard benchmarks.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03692v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

The reason is traditional detection techniques cannot work without the decryption of encrypted traffic. Currently, research on encrypted malicious traffic detection without decryption has focused on feature extraction and the choice of machine learning or deep learning algorithms. In this paper, we first provide an in-depth analysis of traffic features and compare different state-of-the-art traffic feature creation approaches, while proposing a novel concept for encrypted traffic feature which is specifically designed for encrypted malicious traffic analysis. In addition, we propose a framework for encrypted malicious traffic detection. The framework is a two-layer detection framework which consists of both deep learning and traditional machine learning algorithms. Through comparative experiments, it outperforms classical deep learning and traditional machine learning algorithms, such as ResNet and Random Forest. Moreover, to provide sufficient training data for the deep learning model, we also curate a dataset composed entirely of public datasets. The composed dataset is more comprehensive than using any public dataset alone.

{"title":"T2Ranking: A large-scale Chinese Benchmark for Passage Ranking","abstract":"Passage ranking involves two stages: passage retrieval and passage re-ranking, which are important and challenging topics for both academics and industries in the area of Information Retrieval (IR). However, the commonly-used datasets for passage ranking usually focus on the English language. For non-English scenarios, such as Chinese, the existing datasets are limited in terms of data scale, fine-grained relevance annotation and false negative issues. To address this problem, we introduce T2Ranking, a large-scale Chinese benchmark for passage ranking. T2Ranking comprises more than 300K queries and over 2M unique passages from real-world search engines. Expert annotators are recruited to provide 4-level graded relevance scores (fine-grained) for query-passage pairs instead of binary relevance judgments (coarse-grained). To ease the false negative issues, more passages with higher diversities are considered when performing relevance annotations, especially in the test set, to ensure a more accurate evaluation. Apart from the textual query and passage data, other auxiliary resources are also provided, such as query types and XML files of documents which passages are generated from, to facilitate further studies. To evaluate the dataset, commonly used ranking models are implemented and tested on T2Ranking as baselines. The experimental results show that T2Ranking is challenging and there is still scope for improvement.

{"title":"Fairness through Aleatoric Uncertainty","abstract":"We propose a unique solution to tackle the often-competing goals of fairness and utility in machine learning classification tasks. While fairness ensures that the model's predictions are unbiased and do not discriminate against any particular group, utility focuses on maximizing the accuracy of the model's predictions. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between uncertainty and fairness. Our approach leverages this concept by employing Bayesian learning to estimate the uncertainty in sample predictions where the estimation is independent of confounding effects related to the protected attribute. Through empirical evidence, we show that samples with low classification uncertainty are modeled more accurately and fairly than those with high uncertainty, which may have biased representations and higher prediction errors. To address the challenge of balancing fairness and utility, we propose a novel fairness-utility objective that is defined based on uncertainty quantification. The weights in this objective are determined by the level of uncertainty, allowing us to optimize both fairness and utility simultaneously. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the fairness-utility tradeoff and this applies to both group and individual fairness metrics. This work presents a fresh perspective on the trade-off between accuracy and fairness in machine learning and highlights the potential of using uncertainty as a means to achieve optimal fairness and utility.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03646v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"FedDiSC: A Computation-efficient Federated Learning Framework for Power Systems Disturbance and Cyber Attack Discrimination","abstract":"With the growing concern about the security and privacy of smart grid systems, cyberattacks on critical power grid components, such as state estimation, have proven to be one of the top-priority cyber-related issues and have received significant attention in recent years. However, cyberattack detection in smart grids now faces new challenges, including privacy preservation and decentralized power zones with strategic data owners. To address these technical bottlenecks, this paper proposes a novel Federated Learning-based privacy-preserving and communication-efficient attack detection framework, known as FedDiSC, that enables Discrimination between power System disturbances and Cyberattacks. Specifically, we first propose a Federated Learning approach to enable Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition subsystems of decentralized power grid zones to collaboratively train an attack detection model without sharing sensitive power related data. Secondly, we put forward a representation learning-based Deep Auto-Encoder network to accurately detect power system and cybersecurity anomalies. Lastly, to adapt our proposed framework to the timeliness of real-world cyberattack detection in SGs, we leverage the use of a gradient privacy-preserving quantization scheme known as DP-SIGNSGD to improve its communication efficiency. Extensive simulations of the proposed framework on publicly available Industrial Control Systems datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve superior detection accuracy while preserving the privacy of sensitive power grid related information. Furthermore, we find that the gradient quantization scheme utilized improves communication efficiency by 40% when compared to a traditional federated learning approach without gradient quantization which suggests suitability in a real-world scenario.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03640v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

We introduce a novel federated learning setting (AFCL) where the continual learning of multiple tasks happens at each client with different orderings and in asynchronous time slots. We tackle this novel task using prototype-based learning, a representation loss, fractal pre-training, and a modified aggregation policy. Our approach, called FedSpace, effectively tackles this task as shown by the results on the CIFAR-100 dataset using 3 different federated splits with 50, 100, and 500 clients, respectively.

{"title":"What does ChatGPT return about human values? Exploring value bias in ChatGPT using a descriptive value theory","abstract":"There has been concern about ideological basis and possible discrimination in text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). We test possible value biases in ChatGPT using a psychological value theory. We designed a simple experiment in which we used a number of different probes derived from the Schwartz basic value theory (items from the revised Portrait Value Questionnaire, the value type definitions, value names). We prompted ChatGPT via the OpenAI API repeatedly to generate text and then analyzed the generated corpus for value content with a theory-driven value dictionary using a bag of words approach. Overall, we found little evidence of explicit value bias. The results showed sufficient construct and discriminant validity for the generated text in line with the theoretical predictions of the psychological model, which suggests that the value content was carried through into the outputs with high fidelity. We saw some merging of socially oriented values, which may suggest that these values are less clearly differentiated at a linguistic level or alternatively, this mixing may reflect underlying universal human motivations. We outline some possible applications of our findings for both applications of ChatGPT for corporate usage and policy making as well as future research avenues. We also highlight possible implications of this relatively high-fidelity replication of motivational content using a linguistic model for the theorizing about human values.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03612v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Look how they have grown: Non-destructive Leaf Detection and Size Estimation of Tomato Plants for 3D Growth Monitoring","abstract":"Smart farming is a growing field as technology advances. Plant characteristics are crucial indicators for monitoring plant growth. Research has been done to estimate characteristics like leaf area index, leaf disease, and plant height. However, few methods have been applied to non-destructive measurements of leaf size. In this paper, an automated non-destructive imaged-based measuring system is presented, which uses 2D and 3D data obtained using a Zivid 3D camera, creating 3D virtual representations (digital twins) of the tomato plants. Leaves are detected from corresponding 2D RGB images and mapped to their 3D point cloud using the detected leaf masks, which then pass the leaf point cloud to the plane fitting algorithm to extract the leaf size to provide data for growth monitoring. The performance of the measurement platform has been measured through a comprehensive trial on real-world tomato plants with quantified performance metrics compared to ground truth measurements. Three tomato leaf and height datasets (including 50+ 3D point cloud files of tomato plants) were collected and open-sourced in this project. The proposed leaf size estimation method demonstrates an RMSE value of 4.47mm and an R^2 value of 0.87. The overall measurement system (leaf detection and size estimation algorithms combine) delivers an RMSE value of 8.13mm and an R^2 value of 0.899.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03610v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

In this survey, we present a detailed review for training acceleration. We consider the fundamental update formulation and split its basic components into five main perspectives: (1) data-centric: including dataset regularization, data sampling, and data-centric curriculum learning techniques, which can significantly reduce the computational complexity of the data samples; (2) model-centric, including acceleration of basic modules, compression training, model initialization and model-centric curriculum learning techniques, which focus on accelerating the training via reducing the calculations on parameters; (3) optimization-centric, including the selection of learning rate, the employment of large batchsize, the designs of efficient objectives, and model average techniques, which pay attention to the training policy and improving the generality for the large-scale models; (4) budgeted training, including some distinctive acceleration methods on source-constrained situations; (5) system-centric, including some efficient open-source distributed libraries/systems which provide adequate hardware support for the implementation of acceleration algorithms.

This paper uses contrastive learning to refine audio representations for each machine ID, rather than for each audio sample.

What we possess are numerous isolated filed-specific datasets, thus, it is appealing to jointly pretrain models across aggregation of datasets to enhance data volume and diversity. In this paper, we propose a strong framework for utilizing Multiple datasets to pretrain DETR-like detectors, termed METR, without the need for manual label spaces integration. It converts the typical multi-classification in object detection into binary classification by introducing a pre-trained language model. Specifically, we design a category extraction module for extracting potential categories involved in an image and assign these categories into different queries by language embeddings. Each query is only responsible for predicting a class-specific object. Besides, to adapt our novel detection paradigm, we propose a group bipartite matching strategy that limits the ground truths to match queries assigned to the same category. Extensive experiments demonstrate that METR achieves extraordinary results on either multi-task joint training or the pretrain & finetune paradigm. Notably, our pre-trained models have high flexible transferability and increase the performance upon various DETR-like detectors on COCO val2017 benchmark.

Supervised deep learning for segmentation has achieved unparalleled success when sufficient training data with annotated labels are available. However, annotation is known to be expensive to obtain, especially for histopathology images where the target regions are usually with high morphology variations and irregular shapes. Thus, weakly supervised learning with sparse annotations of points is promising to reduce the annotation workload. In this work, we propose a contrast-based variational model to generate segmentation results, which serve as reliable complementary supervision to train a deep segmentation model for histopathology images. The proposed method considers the common characteristics of target regions in histopathology images and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. It can generate more regionally consistent and smoother boundary segmentation, and is more robust to unlabeled `novel' regions.

{"title":"DualRefine: Self-Supervised Depth and Pose Estimation Through Iterative Epipolar Sampling and Refinement Toward Equilibrium","abstract":"Self-supervised multi-frame depth estimation achieves high accuracy by computing matching costs of pixel correspondences between adjacent frames, injecting geometric information into the network. These pixel-correspondence candidates are computed based on the relative pose estimates between the frames. Accurate pose predictions are essential for precise matching cost computation as they influence the epipolar geometry. Furthermore, improved depth estimates can, in turn, be used to align pose estimates.   Inspired by traditional structure-from-motion (SfM) principles, we propose the DualRefine model, which tightly couples depth and pose estimation through a feedback loop. Our novel update pipeline uses a deep equilibrium model framework to iteratively refine depth estimates and a hidden state of feature maps by computing local matching costs based on epipolar geometry. Importantly, we used the refined depth estimates and feature maps to compute pose updates at each step. This update in the pose estimates slowly alters the epipolar geometry during the refinement process. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate competitive depth prediction and odometry prediction performance surpassing published self-supervised baselines.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03560v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Hierarchical Disentanglement-Alignment Network for Robust SAR Vehicle Recognition","abstract":"Due to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging characteristics, SAR vehicle recognition faces the problem of extracting discriminative and robust target features from a small dataset. Deep learning has shown impressive performance on the MSTAR dataset. However, data bias in a small dataset, such as background correlation, impairs the causality of these methods, i.e., discriminative features contain target and background differences. Moreover, different operating conditions of SAR lead to target signatures and background clutter variations in imaging results. However, many deep learning-based methods only verify robustness to target or background variations in the current experimental setting. In this paper, we propose a novel domain alignment framework named Hierarchical Disentanglement-Alignment Network (HDANet) to enhance features' causality and robustness. Concisely, HDANet consists of three parts: The first part uses data augmentation to generate signature variations for domain alignment. The second part disentangles the target features through a multitask-assisted mask to prevent non-causal clutter from interfering with subsequent alignment and recognition. Thirdly, a contrastive loss is employed for domain alignment to extract robust target features, and the SimSiam structure is applied to mitigate conflicts between contrastive loss and feature discrimination. Finally, the proposed method shows high robustness across MSTAR's multiple target, sensor, and environment variants. Noteworthy, we add a new scene variant to verify the robustness to target and background variations. Moreover, the saliency map and Shapley value qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate causality.

ML developers must carefully collect and curate their datasets, and document their provenance. They must also make sure to respect intellectual property rights, preserve individual privacy, and use data in an ethical way. Over the past few years, ML models have significantly increased in size and complexity. These models require a very large amount of data and compute capacity to train, to the extent that any defects in the training corpus cannot be trivially remedied by retraining the model from scratch. Despite sophisticated controls on training data and a significant amount of effort dedicated to ensuring that training corpora are properly composed, the sheer volume of data required for the models makes it challenging to manually inspect each datum comprising a training corpus. One potential fix for training corpus data defects is model disgorgement -- the elimination of not just the improperly used data, but also the effects of improperly used data on any component of an ML model. Model disgorgement techniques can be used to address a wide range of issues, such as reducing bias or toxicity, increasing fidelity, and ensuring responsible usage of intellectual property. In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy of possible disgorgement methods that are applicable to modern ML systems. In particular, we investigate the meaning of \"removing the effects\" of data in the trained model in a way that does not require retraining from scratch.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03545v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

This works as a regularization to properly align topics and prevent degenerate topic representations of words, which mitigates the repetitive topic issue. To address the low-coverage dictionary issue, we further propose a cross-lingual vocabulary linking method that finds more linked cross-lingual words for topic alignment beyond the translations of a given dictionary.

It is especially challenging to surpass the performance of tree-like ensembles, such as XGBoost or Random Forests, on small-sized datasets (less than 1k samples). To tackle this challenge, we introduce HyperTab, a hypernetwork-based approach to solving small sample problems on tabular datasets. By combining the advantages of Random Forests and neural networks, HyperTab generates an ensemble of neural networks, where each target model is specialized to process a specific lower-dimensional view of the data. Since each view plays the role of data augmentation, we virtually increase the number of training samples while keeping the number of trainable parameters unchanged, which prevents model overfitting. We evaluated HyperTab on more than 40 tabular datasets of a varying number of samples and domains of origin, and compared its performance with shallow and deep learning models representing the current state-of-the-art.

GIA can also be used for the interaction of other features because of the universality of its structure.

{"title":"ChatPipe: Orchestrating Data Preparation Program by Optimizing Human-ChatGPT Interactions","abstract":"Orchestrating a high-quality data preparation program is essential for successful machine learning (ML), but it is known to be time and effort consuming. Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models like ChatGPT in generating programs by interacting with users through natural language prompts, there are still limitations. Specifically, a user must provide specific prompts to iteratively guide ChatGPT in improving data preparation programs, which requires a certain level of expertise in programming, the dataset used and the ML task. Moreover, once a program has been generated, it is non-trivial to revisit a previous version or make changes to the program without starting the process over again. In this paper, we present ChatPipe, a novel system designed to facilitate seamless interaction between users and ChatGPT. ChatPipe provides users with effective recommendation on next data preparation operations, and guides ChatGPT to generate program for the operations. Also, ChatPipe enables users to easily roll back to previous versions of the program, which facilitates more efficient experimentation and testing. We have developed a web application for ChatPipe and prepared several real-world ML tasks from Kaggle. These tasks can showcase the capabilities of ChatPipe and enable VLDB attendees to easily experiment with our novel features to rapidly orchestrate a high-quality data preparation program.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03540v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Adjustable Privacy using Autoencoder-based Learning Structure","abstract":"Inference centers need more data to have a more comprehensive and beneficial learning model, and for this purpose, they need to collect data from data providers. On the other hand, data providers are cautious about delivering their datasets to inference centers in terms of privacy considerations. In this paper, by modifying the structure of the autoencoder, we present a method that manages the utility-privacy trade-off well. To be more precise, the data is first compressed using the encoder, then confidential and non-confidential features are separated and uncorrelated using the classifier. The confidential feature is appropriately combined with noise, and the non-confidential feature is enhanced, and at the end, data with the original data format is produced by the decoder. The proposed architecture also allows data providers to set the level of privacy required for confidential features. The proposed method has been examined for both image and categorical databases, and the results show a significant performance improvement compared to previous methods.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03538v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Domain Adaptive Multiple Instance Learning for Instance-level Prediction of Pathological Images","abstract":"Pathological image analysis is an important process for detecting abnormalities such as cancer from cell images. However, since the image size is generally very large, the cost of providing detailed annotations is high, which makes it difficult to apply machine learning techniques. One way to improve the performance of identifying abnormalities while keeping the annotation cost low is to use only labels for each slide, or to use information from another dataset that has already been labeled. However, such weak supervisory information often does not provide sufficient performance. In this paper, we proposed a new task setting to improve the classification performance of the target dataset without increasing annotation costs. And to solve this problem, we propose a pipeline that uses multiple instance learning (MIL) and domain adaptation (DA) methods. Furthermore, in order to combine the supervisory information of both methods effectively, we propose a method to create pseudo-labels with high confidence. We conducted experiments on the pathological image dataset we created for this study and showed that the proposed method significantly improves the classification performance compared to existing methods.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03537v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"A Mixer Layer is Worth One Graph Convolution: Unifying MLP-Mixers and GCNs for Human Motion Prediction","abstract":"The past few years has witnessed the dominance of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) over human motion prediction, while their performance is still far from satisfactory. Recently, MLP-Mixers show competitive results on top of being more efficient and simple. To extract features, GCNs typically follow an aggregate-and-update paradigm, while Mixers rely on token mixing and channel mixing operations. The two research paths have been independently established in the community. In this paper, we develop a novel perspective by unifying Mixers and GCNs. We show that a mixer layer can be seen as a graph convolutional layer applied to a fully-connected graph with parameterized adjacency. Extending this theoretical finding to the practical side, we propose Meta-Mixing Network (M$^2$-Net). Assisted with a novel zero aggregation operation, our network is capable of capturing both the structure-agnostic and the structure-sensitive dependencies in a collaborative manner. Not only is it computationally efficient, but most importantly, it also achieves state-of-the-art performance. An extensive evaluation on the Human3.6M, AMASS, and 3DPW datasets shows that M$^2$-Net consistently outperforms all other approaches. We hope our work brings the community one step further towards truly predictable human motion.

{"title":"From Retrieval to Generation: Efficient and Effective Entity Set Expansion","abstract":"Entity Set Expansion (ESE) is a critical task aiming to expand entities of the target semantic class described by a small seed entity set. Most existing ESE methods are retrieval-based frameworks that need to extract the contextual features of entities and calculate the similarity between seed entities and candidate entities. To achieve the two purposes, they should iteratively traverse the corpus and the entity vocabulary provided in the datasets, resulting in poor efficiency and scalability. The experimental results indicate that the time consumed by the retrieval-based ESE methods increases linearly with entity vocabulary and corpus size. In this paper, we firstly propose a generative ESE framework, Generative Entity Set Expansion (GenExpan), which utilizes a generative pre-trained language model to accomplish ESE task. Specifically, a prefix tree is employed to guarantee the validity of entity generation, and automatically generated class names are adopted to guide the model to generate target entities. Moreover, we propose Knowledge Calibration and Generative Ranking to further bridge the gap between generic knowledge of the language model and the goal of ESE task. Experiments on publicly available datasets show that GenExpan is efficient and effective. For efficiency, expansion time consumed by GenExpan is independent of entity vocabulary and corpus size, and GenExpan achieves an average 600% speedup compared to strong baselines. For expansion performance, our framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art ESE methods.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03531v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Lift3D: Synthesize 3D Training Data by Lifting 2D GAN to 3D Generative Radiance Field","abstract":"This work explores the use of 3D generative models to synthesize training data for 3D vision tasks. The key requirements of the generative models are that the generated data should be photorealistic to match the real-world scenarios, and the corresponding 3D attributes should be aligned with given sampling labels. However, we find that the recent NeRF-based 3D GANs hardly meet the above requirements due to their designed generation pipeline and the lack of explicit 3D supervision. In this work, we propose Lift3D, an inverted 2D-to-3D generation framework to achieve the data generation objectives. Lift3D has several merits compared to prior methods: (1) Unlike previous 3D GANs that the output resolution is fixed after training, Lift3D can generalize to any camera intrinsic with higher resolution and photorealistic output. (2) By lifting well-disentangled 2D GAN to 3D object NeRF, Lift3D provides explicit 3D information of generated objects, thus offering accurate 3D annotations for downstream tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework by augmenting autonomous driving datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our data generation framework can effectively improve the performance of 3D object detectors.

{"title":"On-site Noise Exposure technique for noise-robust machine fault classification","abstract":"In-situ classification of faulty sounds is an important issue in machine health monitoring and diagnosis. However, in a noisy environment such as a factory, machine sound is always mixed up with environmental noises, and noise-only periods can exist when a machine is not in operation. Therefore, a deep neural network (DNN)-based fault classifier has to be able to distinguish noise from machine sound and be robust to mixed noises. To deal with these problems, we investigate on-site noise exposure (ONE) that exposes a DNN model to the noises recorded in the same environment where the machine operates. Like the outlier exposure technique, noise exposure trains a DNN classifier to produce a uniform predicted probability distribution against noise-only data. During inference, the DNN classifier trained by ONE outputs the maximum softmax probability as the noise score and determines the noise-only period. We mix machine sound and noises of the ToyADMOS2 dataset to simulate highly noisy data. A ResNet-based classifier trained by ONE is evaluated and compared with those trained by other out-of-distribution detection techniques. The test results show that exposing a model to on-site noises can make a model more robust than using other noises or detection techniques.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03522v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Generative Recommendation: Towards Next-generation Recommender Paradigm","abstract":"Recommender systems typically retrieve items from an item corpus for personalized recommendations. However, such a retrieval-based recommender paradigm faces two limitations: 1) the human-generated items in the corpus might fail to satisfy the users' diverse information needs, and 2) users usually adjust the recommendations via passive and inefficient feedback such as clicks. Nowadays, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has revealed significant success across various domains, offering the potential to overcome these limitations: 1) generative AI can produce personalized items to meet users' specific information needs, and 2) the newly emerged ChatGPT significantly facilitates users to express information needs more precisely via natural language instructions. In this light, the boom of AIGC points the way towards the next-generation recommender paradigm with two new objectives: 1) generating personalized content through generative AI, and 2) integrating user instructions to guide content generation.   To this end, we propose a novel Generative Recommender paradigm named GeneRec, which adopts an AI generator to personalize content generation and leverages user instructions to acquire users' information needs. Specifically, we pre-process users' instructions and traditional feedback (e.g., clicks) via an instructor to output the generation guidance. Given the guidance, we instantiate the AI generator through an AI editor and an AI creator to repurpose existing items and create new items, respectively. Eventually, GeneRec can perform content retrieval, repurposing, and creation to meet users' information needs. Besides, to ensure the trustworthiness of the generated items, we emphasize various fidelity checks such as authenticity and legality checks. Lastly, we study the feasibility of implementing the AI editor and AI creator on micro-video generation, showing promising results.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03516v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"Multispectral Imaging for Differential Face Morphing Attack Detection: A Preliminary Study","abstract":"Face morphing attack detection is emerging as an increasingly challenging problem owing to advancements in high-quality and realistic morphing attack generation. Reliable detection of morphing attacks is essential because these attacks are targeted for border control applications. This paper presents a multispectral framework for differential morphing-attack detection (D-MAD). The D-MAD methods are based on using two facial images that are captured from the ePassport (also called the reference image) and the trusted device (for example, Automatic Border Control (ABC) gates) to detect whether the face image presented in ePassport is morphed. The proposed multispectral D-MAD framework introduce a multispectral image captured as a trusted capture to capture seven different spectral bands to detect morphing attacks. Extensive experiments were conducted on the newly created datasets with 143 unique data subjects that were captured using both visible and multispectral cameras in multiple sessions.

Among all the local flowers in Bangladesh, the rose is one of the most popular and demanded flowers. Roses are the most desirable flower not only in Bangladesh but also throughout the world. Roses can be used for many other purposes apart from decoration. As roses have a great demand in the flower business so rose breed detection will be very essential. However, there is no remarkable work for breed detection of a particular flower unlike the classification of different flowers. In this research, we have proposed a model to detect rose breeds from images using transfer learning techniques. For such work in flowers, resources are not enough in image processing and classification, so we needed a large dataset of the massive number of images to train our model. we have used 1939 raw images of five different breeds and we have generated 9306 images for the training dataset and 388 images for the testing dataset to validate the model using augmentation. We have applied four transfer learning models in this research, which are Inception V3, ResNet50, Xception, and VGG16.

{"title":"Continuous Input Embedding Size Search For Recommender Systems","abstract":"Latent factor models are the most popular backbones for today's recommender systems owing to their prominent performance. Latent factor models represent users and items as real-valued embedding vectors for pairwise similarity computation, and all embeddings are traditionally restricted to a uniform size that is relatively large (e.g., 256-dimensional). With the exponentially expanding user base and item catalog in contemporary e-commerce, this design is admittedly becoming memory-inefficient. To facilitate lightweight recommendation, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently opened up opportunities for identifying varying embedding sizes for different users/items. However, challenged by search efficiency and learning an optimal RL policy, existing RL-based methods are restricted to highly discrete, predefined embedding size choices. This leads to a largely overlooked potential of introducing finer granularity into embedding sizes to obtain better recommendation effectiveness under a given memory budget. In this paper, we propose continuous input embedding size search (CIESS), a novel RL-based method that operates on a continuous search space with arbitrary embedding sizes to choose from. In CIESS, we further present an innovative random walk-based exploration strategy to allow the RL policy to efficiently explore more candidate embedding sizes and converge to a better decision. CIESS is also model-agnostic and hence generalizable to a variety of latent factor RSs, whilst experiments on two real-world datasets have shown state-of-the-art performance of CIESS under different memory budgets when paired with three popular recommendation models.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03501v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"UniSeg: A Prompt-driven Universal Segmentation Model as well as A Strong Representation Learner","abstract":"The universal model emerges as a promising trend for medical image segmentation, paving up the way to build medical imaging large model (MILM). One popular strategy to build universal models is to encode each task as a one-hot vector and generate dynamic convolutional layers at the end of the decoder to extract the interested target. Although successful, it ignores the correlations among tasks and meanwhile is too late to make the model 'aware' of the ongoing task. To address both issues, we propose a prompt-driven Universal Segmentation model (UniSeg) for multi-task medical image segmentation using diverse modalities and domains. We first devise a learnable universal prompt to describe the correlations among all tasks and then convert this prompt and image features into a task-specific prompt, which is fed to the decoder as a part of its input. Thus, we make the model 'aware' of the ongoing task early and boost the task-specific training of the whole decoder. Our results indicate that the proposed UniSeg outperforms other universal models and single-task models on 11 upstream tasks. Moreover, UniSeg also beats other pre-trained models on two downstream datasets, providing the community with a high-quality pre-trained model for 3D medical image segmentation.

{"title":"ParaGraph: Weighted Graph Representation for Performance Optimization of HPC Kernels","abstract":"GPU-based HPC clusters are attracting more scientific application developers due to their extensive parallelism and energy efficiency. In order to achieve portability among a variety of multi/many core architectures, a popular choice for an application developer is to utilize directive-based parallel programming models, such as OpenMP. However, even with OpenMP, the developer must choose from among many strategies for exploiting a GPU or a CPU. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) approaches have brought significant advances in the optimizations of HPC applications. To this end, several ways have been proposed to represent application characteristics for ML models. However, the available techniques fail to capture features that are crucial for exposing parallelism. In this paper, we introduce a new graph-based program representation for parallel applications that extends the Abstract Syntax Tree to represent control and data flow information. The originality of this work lies in the addition of new edges exploiting the implicit ordering and parent-child relationships in ASTs, as well as the introduction of edge weights to account for loop and condition information. We evaluate our proposed representation by training a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict the runtime of an OpenMP code region across CPUs and GPUs. Various transformations utilizing collapse and data transfer between the CPU and GPU are used to construct the dataset. The predicted runtime of the model is used to determine which transformation provides the best performance. Results show that our approach is indeed effective and has normalized RMSE as low as 0.004 to at most 0.01 in its runtime predictions.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03487v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

However, the traditional mini-batch method may not learn the under-represented samples and complex patterns in the data, leading to a longer time for generalization. To address this problem, a variant of the traditional algorithm has been proposed, which trains the network focusing on mini-batches with high loss. The study evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed training using various deep neural networks trained on three benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10).

Furthermore, we introduce a hyper-parameter delta ({\\delta}) that decides how many mini-batches are considered for training. Experiments on various values of {\\delta} found that the performance of the proposed method for smaller {\\delta} values generally results in similar test accuracy and faster generalization. We show that the proposed method generalizes in 26.47% less number of epochs than the traditional mini-batch method in EfficientNet-B4 on STL-10.

{"title":"PSLT: A Light-weight Vision Transformer with Ladder Self-Attention and Progressive Shift","abstract":"Vision Transformer (ViT) has shown great potential for various visual tasks due to its ability to model long-range dependency. However, ViT requires a large amount of computing resource to compute the global self-attention. In this work, we propose a ladder self-attention block with multiple branches and a progressive shift mechanism to develop a light-weight transformer backbone that requires less computing resources (e.g. a relatively small number of parameters and FLOPs), termed Progressive Shift Ladder Transformer (PSLT). First, the ladder self-attention block reduces the computational cost by modelling local self-attention in each branch. In the meanwhile, the progressive shift mechanism is proposed to enlarge the receptive field in the ladder self-attention block by modelling diverse local self-attention for each branch and interacting among these branches. Second, the input feature of the ladder self-attention block is split equally along the channel dimension for each branch, which considerably reduces the computational cost in the ladder self-attention block (with nearly 1/3 the amount of parameters and FLOPs), and the outputs of these branches are then collaborated by a pixel-adaptive fusion. Therefore, the ladder self-attention block with a relatively small number of parameters and FLOPs is capable of modelling long-range interactions. Based on the ladder self-attention block, PSLT performs well on several vision tasks, including image classification, objection detection and person re-identification. On the ImageNet-1k dataset, PSLT achieves a top-1 accuracy of 79.9% with 9.2M parameters and 1.9G FLOPs, which is comparable to several existing models with more than 20M parameters and 4G FLOPs.

Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted in EA tasks due to GNNs' impressive ability to capture structure information. However, we have observed that the oversimplified settings of the existing common EA datasets are distant from real-world scenarios, which obstructs a full understanding of the advancements achieved by recent methods. This phenomenon makes us ponder: Do existing GNN-based EA methods really make great progress?   In this paper, to study the performance of EA methods in realistic settings, we focus on the alignment of highly heterogeneous KGs (HHKGs) (e.g., event KGs and general KGs) which are different with regard to the scale and structure, and share fewer overlapping entities. First, we sweep the unreasonable settings, and propose two new HHKG datasets that closely mimic real-world EA scenarios. Then, based on the proposed datasets, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate previous representative EA methods, and reveal interesting findings about the progress of GNN-based EA methods. We find that the structural information becomes difficult to exploit but still valuable in aligning HHKGs. This phenomenon leads to inferior performance of existing EA methods, especially GNN-based methods. Our findings shed light on the potential problems resulting from an impulsive application of GNN-based methods as a panacea for all EA datasets. Finally, we introduce a simple but effective method: Simple-HHEA, which comprehensively utilizes entity name, structure, and temporal information.

Most widely used methods do not employ deep learning and do not exploit the inherently multimodal nature of documents. Notably, record linkage is typically conceptualized as a string-matching problem. This study develops CLIPPINGS, (Contrastively Linking Pooled Pre-trained Embeddings), a multimodal framework for record linkage. CLIPPINGS employs end-to-end training of symmetric vision and language bi-encoders, aligned through contrastive language-image pre-training, to learn a metric space where the pooled image-text representation for a given instance is close to representations in the same class and distant from representations in different classes. At inference time, instances can be linked by retrieving their nearest neighbor from an offline exemplar embedding index or by clustering their representations. The study examines two challenging applications: constructing comprehensive supply chains for mid-20th century Japan through linking firm level financial records - with each firm name represented by its crop in the document image and the corresponding OCR - and detecting which image-caption pairs in a massive corpus of historical U.S. newspapers came from the same underlying photo wire source. CLIPPINGS outperforms widely used string matching methods by a wide margin and also outperforms unimodal methods.

Although existing SSL methods have shown good performances under those evaluation protocols, we observe that the performances are very sensitive to the hyperparameters involved in LP and TL. We argue that this is an undesirable behavior since truly generic representations should be easily adapted to any other visual recognition task, i.e., the learned representations should be robust to the settings of LP and TL hyperparameters. In this work, we try to figure out the cause of performance sensitivity by conducting extensive experiments with state-of-the-art SSL methods. First, we find that input normalization for LP is crucial to eliminate performance variations according to the hyperparameters. Specifically, batch normalization before feeding inputs to a linear classifier considerably improves the stability of evaluation, and also resolves inconsistency of $k$-NN and LP metrics. Second, for TL, we demonstrate that a weight decay parameter in SSL significantly affects the transferability of learned representations, which cannot be identified by LP or $k$-NN evaluations on the upstream dataset. We believe that the findings of this study will be beneficial for the community by drawing attention to the shortcomings in the current SSL evaluation schemes and underscoring the need to reconsider them.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03456v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"Supervised Contrastive Learning with Heterogeneous Similarity for Distribution Shifts","abstract":"Distribution shifts are problems where the distribution of data changes between training and testing, which can significantly degrade the performance of a model deployed in the real world. Recent studies suggest that one reason for the degradation is a type of overfitting, and that proper regularization can mitigate the degradation, especially when using highly representative models such as neural networks. In this paper, we propose a new regularization using the supervised contrastive learning to prevent such overfitting and to train models that do not degrade their performance under the distribution shifts. We extend the cosine similarity in contrastive loss to a more general similarity measure and propose to use different parameters in the measure when comparing a sample to a positive or negative example, which is analytically shown to act as a kind of margin in contrastive loss. Experiments on benchmark datasets that emulate distribution shifts, including subpopulation shift and domain generalization, demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing regularization methods.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03440v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"Cleansing Jewel: A Neural Spelling Correction Model Built On Google OCR-ed Tibetan Manuscripts","abstract":"Scholars in the humanities rely heavily on ancient manuscripts to study history, religion, and socio-political structures in the past. Many efforts have been devoted to digitizing these precious manuscripts using OCR technology, but most manuscripts were blemished over the centuries so that an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) program cannot be expected to capture faded graphs and stains on pages. This work presents a neural spelling correction model built on Google OCR-ed Tibetan Manuscripts to auto-correct OCR-ed noisy output. This paper is divided into four sections: dataset, model architecture, training and analysis. First, we feature-engineered our raw Tibetan etext corpus into two sets of structured data frames -- a set of paired toy data and a set of paired real data. Then, we implemented a Confidence Score mechanism into the Transformer architecture to perform spelling correction tasks. According to the Loss and Character Error Rate, our Transformer + Confidence score mechanism architecture proves to be superior to Transformer, LSTM-2-LSTM and GRU-2-GRU architectures. Finally, to examine the robustness of our model, we analyzed erroneous tokens, visualized Attention and Self-Attention heatmaps in our model.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03427v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"Towards Corpus-Scale Discovery of Selection Biases in News Coverage: Comparing What Sources Say About Entities as a Start","abstract":"News sources undergo the process of selecting newsworthy information when covering a certain topic. The process inevitably exhibits selection biases, i.e. news sources' typical patterns of choosing what information to include in news coverage, due to their agenda differences. To understand the magnitude and implications of selection biases, one must first discover (1) on what topics do sources typically have diverging definitions of \"newsworthy\" information, and (2) do the content selection patterns correlate with certain attributes of the news sources, e.g. ideological leaning, etc.   The goal of the paper is to investigate and discuss the challenges of building scalable NLP systems for discovering patterns of media selection biases directly from news content in massive-scale news corpora, without relying on labeled data. To facilitate research in this domain, we propose and study a conceptual framework, where we compare how sources typically mention certain controversial entities, and use such as indicators for the sources' content selection preferences. We empirically show the capabilities of the framework through a case study on NELA-2020, a corpus of 1.8M news articles in English from 519 news sources worldwide. We demonstrate an unsupervised representation learning method to capture the selection preferences for how sources typically mention controversial entities. Our experiments show that that distributional divergence of such representations, when studied collectively across entities and news sources, serve as good indicators for an individual source's ideological leaning. We hope our findings will provide insights for future research on media selection biases.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03414v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"$R^{2}$Former: Unified $R$etrieval and $R$eranking Transformer for Place Recognition","abstract":"Visual Place Recognition (VPR) estimates the location of query images by matching them with images in a reference database. Conventional methods generally adopt aggregated CNN features for global retrieval and RANSAC-based geometric verification for reranking. However, RANSAC only employs geometric information but ignores other possible information that could be useful for reranking, e.g. local feature correlations, and attention values. In this paper, we propose a unified place recognition framework that handles both retrieval and reranking with a novel transformer model, named $R^{2}$Former. The proposed reranking module takes feature correlation, attention value, and xy coordinates into account, and learns to determine whether the image pair is from the same location. The whole pipeline is end-to-end trainable and the reranking module alone can also be adopted on other CNN or transformer backbones as a generic component. Remarkably, $R^{2}$Former significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on major VPR datasets with much less inference time and memory consumption. It also achieves the state-of-the-art on the hold-out MSLS challenge set and could serve as a simple yet strong solution for real-world large-scale applications. Experiments also show vision transformer tokens are comparable and sometimes better than CNN local features on local matching.

{"title":"Localized Region Contrast for Enhancing Self-Supervised Learning in Medical Image Segmentation","abstract":"Recent advancements in self-supervised learning have demonstrated that effective visual representations can be learned from unlabeled images. This has led to increased interest in applying self-supervised learning to the medical domain, where unlabeled images are abundant and labeled images are difficult to obtain. However, most self-supervised learning approaches are modeled as image level discriminative or generative proxy tasks, which may not capture the finer level representations necessary for dense prediction tasks like multi-organ segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework that integrates Localized Region Contrast (LRC) to enhance existing self-supervised pre-training methods for medical image segmentation. Our approach involves identifying Super-pixels by Felzenszwalb's algorithm and performing local contrastive learning using a novel contrastive sampling loss. Through extensive experiments on three multi-organ segmentation datasets, we demonstrate that integrating LRC to an existing self-supervised method in a limited annotation setting significantly improves segmentation performance. Moreover, we show that LRC can also be applied to fully-supervised pre-training methods to further boost performance.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03406v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

From this point, we can note the importance of building a new structured dataset to solve the lack of structured data.

The dataset consists of more than thirty-six thousand records. In addition, this work proposes long short term memory (LSTM) units and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for building the named entity recognition model in the Arabic language.

{"title":"Exposing and Mitigating Spurious Correlations for Cross-Modal Retrieval","abstract":"Cross-modal retrieval methods are the preferred tool to search databases for the text that best matches a query image and vice versa. However, image-text retrieval models commonly learn to memorize spurious correlations in the training data, such as frequent object co-occurrence, instead of looking at the actual underlying reasons for the prediction in the image. For image-text retrieval, this manifests in retrieved sentences that mention objects that are not present in the query image. In this work, we introduce ODmAP@k, an object decorrelation metric that measures a model's robustness to spurious correlations in the training data. We use automatic image and text manipulations to control the presence of such object correlations in designated test data. Additionally, our data synthesis technique is used to tackle model biases due to spurious correlations of semantically unrelated objects in the training data. We apply our proposed pipeline, which involves the finetuning of image-text retrieval frameworks on carefully designed synthetic data, to three state-of-the-art models for image-text retrieval. This results in significant improvements for all three models, both in terms of the standard retrieval performance and in terms of our object decorrelation metric.

The latest large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, exhibit dramatic capabilities on diverse natural language processing tasks. However, existing studies on ChatGPT's zero-shot performance for mental health analysis have limitations in inadequate evaluation, utilization of emotional information, and explainability of methods. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate the mental health analysis and emotional reasoning ability of ChatGPT on 11 datasets across 5 tasks, including binary and multi-class mental health condition detection, cause/factor detection of mental health conditions, emotion recognition in conversations, and causal emotion entailment. We empirically analyze the impact of different prompting strategies with emotional cues on ChatGPT's mental health analysis ability and explainability. Experimental results show that ChatGPT outperforms traditional neural network methods but still has a significant gap with advanced task-specific methods. The qualitative analysis shows its potential in explainability compared with advanced black-box methods but also limitations on robustness and inaccurate reasoning. Prompt engineering with emotional cues is found to be effective in improving its performance on mental health analysis but requires the proper way of emotion infusion.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03347v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Spintronic Physical Reservoir for Autonomous Prediction and Long-Term Household Energy Load Forecasting","abstract":"In this study, we have shown autonomous long-term prediction with a spintronic physical reservoir. Due to the short-term memory property of the magnetization dynamics, non-linearity arises in the reservoir states which could be used for long-term prediction tasks using simple linear regression for online training. During the prediction stage, the output is directly fed to the input of the reservoir for autonomous prediction. We employ our proposed reservoir for the modeling of the chaotic time series such as Mackey-Glass and dynamic time-series data, such as household building energy loads. Since only the last layer of a RC needs to be trained with linear regression, it is well suited for learning in real time on edge devices. Here we show that a skyrmion based magnetic tunnel junction can potentially be used as a prototypical RC but any nanomagnetic magnetic tunnel junction with nonlinear magnetization behavior can implement such a RC. By comparing our spintronic physical RC approach with state-of-the-art energy load forecasting algorithms, such as LSTMs and RNNs, we conclude that the proposed framework presents good performance in achieving high predictions accuracy, while also requiring low memory and energy both of which are at a premium in hardware resource and power constrained edge applications. Further, the proposed approach is shown to require very small training datasets and at the same time being at least 16X energy efficient compared to the state-of-the-art sequence to sequence LSTM for accurate household load predictions.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03343v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

To visualize the data in a formal context, Ganter and Glodeanu proposed a biplot based on two ordinal factors. For the biplot to be useful, it is important that these factors comprise as much data points as possible, i.e., that they cover a large part of the incidence relation. In this work, we investigate such ordinal two-factorizations. First, we investigate for formal contexts that omit ordinal two-factorizations the disjointness of the two factors. Then, we show that deciding on the existence of two-factorizations of a given size is an NP-complete problem which makes computing maximal factorizations computationally expensive. Finally, we provide the algorithm Ord2Factor that allows us to compute large ordinal two-factorizations.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03338v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"DSVAE: Interpretable Disentangled Representation for Synthetic Speech Detection","abstract":"Tools to generate high quality synthetic speech signal that is perceptually indistinguishable from speech recorded from human speakers are easily available. Several approaches have been proposed for detecting synthetic speech. Many of these approaches use deep learning methods as a black box without providing reasoning for the decisions they make. This limits the interpretability of these approaches. In this paper, we propose Disentangled Spectrogram Variational Auto Encoder (DSVAE) which is a two staged trained variational autoencoder that processes spectrograms of speech using disentangled representation learning to generate interpretable representations of a speech signal for detecting synthetic speech. DSVAE also creates an activation map to highlight the spectrogram regions that discriminate synthetic and bona fide human speech signals. We evaluated the representations obtained from DSVAE using the ASVspoof2019 dataset. Our experimental results show high accuracy (>98%) on detecting synthetic speech from 6 known and 10 out of 11 unknown speech synthesizers. We also visualize the representation obtained from DSVAE for 17 different speech synthesizers and verify that they are indeed interpretable and discriminate bona fide and synthetic speech from each of the synthesizers.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03323v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"$\\text{DC}^2$: Dual-Camera Defocus Control by Learning to Refocus","abstract":"Smartphone cameras today are increasingly approaching the versatility and quality of professional cameras through a combination of hardware and software advancements. However, fixed aperture remains a key limitation, preventing users from controlling the depth of field (DoF) of captured images. At the same time, many smartphones now have multiple cameras with different fixed apertures -- specifically, an ultra-wide camera with wider field of view and deeper DoF and a higher resolution primary camera with shallower DoF. In this work, we propose $\\text{DC}^2$, a system for defocus control for synthetically varying camera aperture, focus distance and arbitrary defocus effects by fusing information from such a dual-camera system. Our key insight is to leverage real-world smartphone camera dataset by using image refocus as a proxy task for learning to control defocus. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on real-world data demonstrate our system's efficacy where we outperform state-of-the-art on defocus deblurring, bokeh rendering, and image refocus. Finally, we demonstrate creative post-capture defocus control enabled by our method, including tilt-shift and content-based defocus effects.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03285v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Visual Dependency Transformers: Dependency Tree Emerges from Reversed Attention","abstract":"Humans possess a versatile mechanism for extracting structured representations of our visual world. When looking at an image, we can decompose the scene into entities and their parts as well as obtain the dependencies between them. To mimic such capability, we propose Visual Dependency Transformers (DependencyViT) that can induce visual dependencies without any labels. We achieve that with a novel neural operator called \\emph{reversed attention} that can naturally capture long-range visual dependencies between image patches. Specifically, we formulate it as a dependency graph where a child token in reversed attention is trained to attend to its parent tokens and send information following a normalized probability distribution rather than gathering information in conventional self-attention. With such a design, hierarchies naturally emerge from reversed attention layers, and a dependency tree is progressively induced from leaf nodes to the root node unsupervisedly.   DependencyViT offers several appealing benefits. (i) Entities and their parts in an image are represented by different subtrees, enabling part partitioning from dependencies; (ii) Dynamic visual pooling is made possible. The leaf nodes which rarely send messages can be pruned without hindering the model performance, based on which we propose the lightweight DependencyViT-Lite to reduce the computational and memory footprints; (iii) DependencyViT works well on both self- and weakly-supervised pretraining paradigms on ImageNet, and demonstrates its effectiveness on 8 datasets and 5 tasks, such as unsupervised part and saliency segmentation, recognition, and detection.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03282v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"LANe: Lighting-Aware Neural Fields for Compositional Scene Synthesis","abstract":"Neural fields have recently enjoyed great success in representing and rendering 3D scenes. However, most state-of-the-art implicit representations model static or dynamic scenes as a whole, with minor variations. Existing work on learning disentangled world and object neural fields do not consider the problem of composing objects into different world neural fields in a lighting-aware manner. We present Lighting-Aware Neural Field (LANe) for the compositional synthesis of driving scenes in a physically consistent manner. Specifically, we learn a scene representation that disentangles the static background and transient elements into a world-NeRF and class-specific object-NeRFs to allow compositional synthesis of multiple objects in the scene. Furthermore, we explicitly designed both the world and object models to handle lighting variation, which allows us to compose objects into scenes with spatially varying lighting. This is achieved by constructing a light field of the scene and using it in conjunction with a learned shader to modulate the appearance of the object NeRFs. We demonstrate the performance of our model on a synthetic dataset of diverse lighting conditions rendered with the CARLA simulator, as well as a novel real-world dataset of cars collected at different times of the day. Our approach shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art compositional scene synthesis on the challenging dataset setup, via composing object-NeRFs learned from one scene into an entirely different scene whilst still respecting the lighting variations in the novel scene.

Recent NeRF based methods achieve impressive fidelity of 3D reconstruction, but bake the lighting and shadows into the radiance field, while mesh-based methods that facilitate intrinsic decomposition through differentiable rendering have not yet scaled to the complexity and scale of outdoor scenes. We present a novel inverse rendering framework for large urban scenes capable of jointly reconstructing the scene geometry, spatially-varying materials, and HDR lighting from a set of posed RGB images with optional depth. Specifically, we use a neural field to account for the primary rays, and use an explicit mesh (reconstructed from the underlying neural field) for modeling secondary rays that produce higher-order lighting effects such as cast shadows. By faithfully disentangling complex geometry and materials from lighting effects, our method enables photorealistic relighting with specular and shadow effects on several outdoor datasets. Moreover, it supports physics-based scene manipulations such as virtual object insertion with ray-traced shadow casting.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03266v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

For example, by simply adding CoT instruction ``Let's think step-by-step'' to each input query of MultiArith dataset, GPT-3's accuracy can be improved from 17.7\\% to 78.7\\%. However, it is not clear whether CoT is still effective on more recent instruction finetuned (IFT) LLMs such as ChatGPT. Surprisingly, on ChatGPT, CoT is no longer effective for certain tasks such as arithmetic reasoning while still keeping effective on other reasoning tasks. Moreover, on the former tasks, ChatGPT usually achieves the best performance and can generate CoT even without being instructed to do so. Hence, it is plausible that ChatGPT has already been trained on these tasks with CoT and thus memorized the instruction so it implicitly follows such an instruction when applied to the same queries, even without CoT. Our analysis reflects a potential risk of overfitting/bias toward instructions introduced in IFT, which becomes more common in training LLMs. In addition, it indicates possible leakage of the pretraining recipe, e.g., one can verify whether a dataset and instruction were used in training ChatGPT. Our experiments report new baseline results of ChatGPT on a variety of reasoning tasks and shed novel insights into LLM's profiling, instruction memorization, and pretraining dataset leakage.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03262v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

To mitigate this problem, we introduce an unsupervised auxiliary task of learning an implicit underlying surface representation simultaneously on source and target data.

We show through a rigorous human evaluation that asking the Gpt-3.5 (text-davinci-003) LLM to translate an entire literary paragraph (e.g., from a novel) at once results in higher-quality translations than standard sentence-by-sentence translation across 18 linguistically-diverse language pairs (e.g., translating into and out of Japanese, Polish, and English). Our evaluation, which took approximately 350 hours of effort for annotation and analysis, is conducted by hiring translators fluent in both the source and target language and asking them to provide both span-level error annotations as well as preference judgments of which system's translations are better. We observe that discourse-level LLM translators commit fewer mistranslations, grammar errors, and stylistic inconsistencies than sentence-level approaches. With that said, critical errors still abound, including occasional content omissions, and a human translator's intervention remains necessary to ensure that the author's voice remains intact.

However, GWAS studies have technical variations that affect the reproducibility of identified biomarkers, such as differences in genotyping platforms and selection criteria for individuals to be genotyped. To address this issue, we collected five GWAS datasets from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) and explored several data integration strategies. We evaluated the agreement among different strategies in terms of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that were identified as potential PD biomarkers. Our results showed a low concordance of biomarkers discovered using different datasets or integration strategies. However, we identified fifty SNPs that were identified at least twice, which could potentially serve as novel PD biomarkers.

{"title":"Data AUDIT: Identifying Attribute Utility- and Detectability-Induced Bias in Task Models","abstract":"To safely deploy deep learning-based computer vision models for computer-aided detection and diagnosis, we must ensure that they are robust and reliable. Towards that goal, algorithmic auditing has received substantial attention. To guide their audit procedures, existing methods rely on heuristic approaches or high-level objectives (e.g., non-discrimination in regards to protected attributes, such as sex, gender, or race). However, algorithms may show bias with respect to various attributes beyond the more obvious ones, and integrity issues related to these more subtle attributes can have serious consequences. To enable the generation of actionable, data-driven hypotheses which identify specific dataset attributes likely to induce model bias, we contribute a first technique for the rigorous, quantitative screening of medical image datasets. Drawing from literature in the causal inference and information theory domains, our procedure decomposes the risks associated with dataset attributes in terms of their detectability and utility (defined as the amount of information knowing the attribute gives about a task label). To demonstrate the effectiveness and sensitivity of our method, we develop a variety of datasets with synthetically inserted artifacts with different degrees of association to the target label that allow evaluation of inherited model biases via comparison of performance against true counterfactual examples. Using these datasets and results from hundreds of trained models, we show our screening method reliably identifies nearly imperceptible bias-inducing artifacts. Lastly, we apply our method to the natural attributes of a popular skin-lesion dataset and demonstrate its success. Our approach provides a means to perform more systematic algorithmic audits and guide future data collection efforts in pursuit of safer and more reliable models.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03218v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"On the Pareto Front of Multilingual Neural Machine Translation","abstract":"In this work, we study how the generalization performance of a given direction changes with its sampling ratio in Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT). By training over 200 multilingual models with various model sizes, directions, and total numbers of tasks, we find that scalarization leads to a multitask trade-off front that deviates from the traditional Pareto front when there exists data imbalance in the training corpus. That is, the performance of certain translation directions does not improve with the increase of its weight in the multi-task optimization objective, which poses a great challenge to improve the overall performance of all directions. Based on our observations, we propose the Double Power Law to predict the unique performance trade-off front in MNMT, which is robust across various languages, data adequacy, and the number of tasks. Finally, we formulate the sample ratio selection problem in MNMT as an optimization problem based on the Double Power Law, which achieves better performance than temperature searching and gradient manipulation methods using up to half of the total training budget in our experiments.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03216v2","tag":"new-dataset"}}

However, these models have not been shown to scale up the size of the genome, which are on the order of 1e3-1e4 genes. We introduce a new learner, SP-GIES, that jointly learns from interventional and observational datasets and achieves almost 4x speedup against an existing learner for 1,000 node networks. SP-GIES achieves an AUC-PR score of 0.91 on 1,000 node networks, and scales up to 2,000 node networks - this is 4x larger than existing works. We also show how SP-GIES improves downstream optimal experimental design strategies for selecting interventional experiments to perform on the system. This is an important step forward in realizing causal discovery at scale via autonomous experimental design.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03210v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"SLM: End-to-end Feature Selection via Sparse Learnable Masks","abstract":"Feature selection has been widely used to alleviate compute requirements during training, elucidate model interpretability, and improve model generalizability. We propose SLM -- Sparse Learnable Masks -- a canonical approach for end-to-end feature selection that scales well with respect to both the feature dimension and the number of samples. At the heart of SLM lies a simple but effective learnable sparse mask, which learns which features to select, and gives rise to a novel objective that provably maximizes the mutual information (MI) between the selected features and the labels, which can be derived from a quadratic relaxation of mutual information from first principles. In addition, we derive a scaling mechanism that allows SLM to precisely control the number of features selected, through a novel use of sparsemax. This allows for more effective learning as demonstrated in ablation studies. Empirically, SLM achieves state-of-the-art results against a variety of competitive baselines on eight benchmark datasets, often by a significant margin, especially on those with real-world challenges such as class imbalance.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03202v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Micron-BERT: BERT-based Facial Micro-Expression Recognition","abstract":"Micro-expression recognition is one of the most challenging topics in affective computing. It aims to recognize tiny facial movements difficult for humans to perceive in a brief period, i.e., 0.25 to 0.5 seconds. Recent advances in pre-training deep Bidirectional Transformers (BERT) have significantly improved self-supervised learning tasks in computer vision. However, the standard BERT in vision problems is designed to learn only from full images or videos, and the architecture cannot accurately detect details of facial micro-expressions. This paper presents Micron-BERT ($\\mu$-BERT), a novel approach to facial micro-expression recognition. The proposed method can automatically capture these movements in an unsupervised manner based on two key ideas. First, we employ Diagonal Micro-Attention (DMA) to detect tiny differences between two frames. Second, we introduce a new Patch of Interest (PoI) module to localize and highlight micro-expression interest regions and simultaneously reduce noisy backgrounds and distractions. By incorporating these components into an end-to-end deep network, the proposed $\\mu$-BERT significantly outperforms all previous work in various micro-expression tasks. $\\mu$-BERT can be trained on a large-scale unlabeled dataset, i.e., up to 8 million images, and achieves high accuracy on new unseen facial micro-expression datasets. Empirical experiments show $\\mu$-BERT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art performance on four micro-expression benchmarks, including SAMM, CASME II, SMIC, and CASME3, by significant margins.

We describe different kinds of representations for indoor scenes, various indoor scene datasets available for research in the aforementioned areas, and discuss notable works employing machine learning models for such scene modeling tasks based on these representations. Specifically, we focus on the analysis and synthesis of 3D indoor scenes. With respect to analysis, we focus on four basic scene understanding tasks -- 3D object detection, 3D scene segmentation, 3D scene reconstruction and 3D scene similarity. And for synthesis, we mainly discuss neural scene synthesis works, though also highlighting model-driven methods that allow for human-centric, progressive scene synthesis. We identify the challenges involved in modeling scenes for these tasks and the kind of machinery that needs to be developed to adapt to the data representation, and the task setting in general. For each of these tasks, we provide a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art works across different axes such as the choice of data representation, backbone, evaluation metric, input, output, etc., providing an organized review of the literature.

{"title":"CloSET: Modeling Clothed Humans on Continuous Surface with Explicit Template Decomposition","abstract":"Creating animatable avatars from static scans requires the modeling of clothing deformations in different poses. Existing learning-based methods typically add pose-dependent deformations upon a minimally-clothed mesh template or a learned implicit template, which have limitations in capturing details or hinder end-to-end learning. In this paper, we revisit point-based solutions and propose to decompose explicit garment-related templates and then add pose-dependent wrinkles to them. In this way, the clothing deformations are disentangled such that the pose-dependent wrinkles can be better learned and applied to unseen poses. Additionally, to tackle the seam artifact issues in recent state-of-the-art point-based methods, we propose to learn point features on a body surface, which establishes a continuous and compact feature space to capture the fine-grained and pose-dependent clothing geometry. To facilitate the research in this field, we also introduce a high-quality scan dataset of humans in real-world clothing. Our approach is validated on two existing datasets and our newly introduced dataset, showing better clothing deformation results in unseen poses.

{"title":"Bridging the Language Gap: Knowledge Injected Multilingual Question Answering","abstract":"Question Answering (QA) is the task of automatically answering questions posed by humans in natural languages. There are different settings to answer a question, such as abstractive, extractive, boolean, and multiple-choice QA. As a popular topic in natural language processing tasks, extractive question answering task (extractive QA) has gained extensive attention in the past few years. With the continuous evolvement of the world, generalized cross-lingual transfer (G-XLT), where question and answer context are in different languages, poses some unique challenges over cross-lingual transfer (XLT), where question and answer context are in the same language. With the boost of corresponding development of related benchmarks, many works have been done to improve the performance of various language QA tasks. However, only a few works are dedicated to the G-XLT task. In this work, we propose a generalized cross-lingual transfer framework to enhance the model's ability to understand different languages. Specifically, we first assemble triples from different languages to form multilingual knowledge. Since the lack of knowledge between different languages greatly limits models' reasoning ability, we further design a knowledge injection strategy via leveraging link prediction techniques to enrich the model storage of multilingual knowledge. In this way, we can profoundly exploit rich semantic knowledge. Experiment results on real-world datasets MLQA demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the performance by a large margin, outperforming the baseline method by 13.18%/12.00% F1/EM on average.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03159v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Patch-wise Features for Blur Image Classification","abstract":"Images captured through smartphone cameras often suffer from degradation, blur being one of the major ones, posing a challenge in processing these images for downstream tasks. In this paper we propose low-compute lightweight patch-wise features for image quality assessment. Using our method we can discriminate between blur vs sharp image degradation. To this end, we train a decision-tree based XGBoost model on various intuitive image features like gray level variance, first and second order gradients, texture features like local binary patterns. Experiments conducted on an open dataset show that the proposed low compute method results in 90.1% mean accuracy on the validation set, which is comparable to the accuracy of a compute-intensive VGG16 network with 94% mean accuracy fine-tuned to this task. To demonstrate the generalizability of our proposed features and model we test the model on BHBID dataset and an internal dataset where we attain accuracy of 98% and 91%, respectively.

{"title":"Zero-Shot Next-Item Recommendation using Large Pretrained Language Models","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive zero-shot performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, demonstrating their capabilities for inference without training examples. Despite their success, no research has yet explored the potential of LLMs to perform next-item recommendations in the zero-shot setting. We have identified two major challenges that must be addressed to enable LLMs to act effectively as recommenders. First, the recommendation space can be extremely large for LLMs, and LLMs do not know about the target user's past interacted items and preferences. To address this gap, we propose a prompting strategy called Zero-Shot Next-Item Recommendation (NIR) prompting that directs LLMs to make next-item recommendations. Specifically, the NIR-based strategy involves using an external module to generate candidate items based on user-filtering or item-filtering. Our strategy incorporates a 3-step prompting that guides GPT-3 to carry subtasks that capture the user's preferences, select representative previously watched movies, and recommend a ranked list of 10 movies. We evaluate the proposed approach using GPT-3 on MovieLens 100K dataset and show that it achieves strong zero-shot performance, even outperforming some strong sequential recommendation models trained on the entire training dataset. These promising results highlight the ample research opportunities to use LLMs as recommenders.

This research proposes a feature-selection strategy based on the criteria used by insightful people, which could improve ML performance. Our ML model employs features selected by people who correctly evaluated the athletes' future performance. We tested out a strategy to predict the LPGA players' next day performance using their interview video. We asked study participants to predict the players' next day score after watching the interviews and asked why. Using combined features of the facial landmarks' movements, derived from the participants, and meta-data showed a better F1-score than using each feature separately.

{"title":"Improving Visual Question Answering Models through Robustness Analysis and In-Context Learning with a Chain of Basic Questions","abstract":"Deep neural networks have been critical in the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), with research traditionally focused on improving model accuracy. Recently, however, there has been a trend towards evaluating the robustness of these models against adversarial attacks. This involves assessing the accuracy of VQA models under increasing levels of noise in the input, which can target either the image or the proposed query question, dubbed the main question. However, there is currently a lack of proper analysis of this aspect of VQA. This work proposes a new method that utilizes semantically related questions, referred to as basic questions, acting as noise to evaluate the robustness of VQA models. It is hypothesized that as the similarity of a basic question to the main question decreases, the level of noise increases. To generate a reasonable noise level for a given main question, a pool of basic questions is ranked based on their similarity to the main question, and this ranking problem is cast as a LASSO optimization problem. Additionally, this work proposes a novel robustness measure, R_score, and two basic question datasets to standardize the analysis of VQA model robustness. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method effectively analyzes the robustness of VQA models. Moreover, the experiments show that in-context learning with a chain of basic questions can enhance model accuracy.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03147v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

Recently these systems have proved to perform better than humans on held-out test sets of datasets e.g. SQuAD, but their robustness is not guaranteed. The QA model's brittleness is exposed when evaluated on adversarial generated examples by a performance drop. In this study, we explore the robustness of MRC models to entity renaming, with entities from low-resource regions such as Africa. We propose EntSwap, a method for test-time perturbations, to create a test set whose entities have been renamed. In particular, we rename entities of type: country, person, nationality, location, organization, and city, to create AfriSQuAD2. Using the perturbed test set, we evaluate the robustness of three popular MRC models. We find that compared to base models, large models perform well comparatively on novel entities. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that entity type person highly challenges the MRC models' performance.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03145v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

We evaluate detection accuracy and f1score on a real-world dataset CRESCI2017, comprising three bot account categories and five bot sample sets. Our system achieves the highest average accuracy of 98.34% and f1score of 97.99% on two content-intensive bot sets, outperforming previous work and becoming state-of-the-art.

{"title":"From Saliency to DINO: Saliency-guided Vision Transformer for Few-shot Keypoint Detection","abstract":"Unlike current deep keypoint detectors that are trained to recognize limited number of body parts, few-shot keypoint detection (FSKD) attempts to localize any keypoints, including novel or base keypoints, depending on the reference samples. FSKD requires the semantically meaningful relations for keypoint similarity learning to overcome the ubiquitous noise and ambiguous local patterns. One rescue comes with vision transformer (ViT) as it captures long-range relations well. However, ViT may model irrelevant features outside of the region of interest due to the global attention matrix, thus degrading similarity learning between support and query features. In this paper, we present a novel saliency-guided vision transformer, dubbed SalViT, for few-shot keypoint detection. Our SalViT enjoys a uniquely designed masked self-attention and a morphology learner, where the former introduces saliency map as a soft mask to constrain the self-attention on foregrounds, while the latter leverages the so-called power normalization to adjust morphology of saliency map, realizing ``dynamically changing receptive field''. Moreover, as salinecy detectors add computations, we show that attentive masks of DINO transformer can replace saliency. On top of SalViT, we also investigate i) transductive FSKD that enhances keypoint representations with unlabelled data and ii) FSKD under occlusions. We show that our model performs well on five public datasets and achieves ~10% PCK higher than the normally trained model under severe occlusions.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03140v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Simplifying Content-Based Neural News Recommendation: On User Modeling and Training Objectives","abstract":"The advent of personalized news recommendation has given rise to increasingly complex recommender architectures. Most neural news recommenders rely on user click behavior and typically introduce dedicated user encoders that aggregate the content of clicked news into user embeddings (early fusion). These models are predominantly trained with standard point-wise classification objectives. The existing body of work exhibits two main shortcomings: (1) despite general design homogeneity, direct comparisons between models are hindered by varying evaluation datasets and protocols; (2) it leaves alternative model designs and training objectives vastly unexplored. In this work, we present a unified framework for news recommendation, allowing for a systematic and fair comparison of news recommenders across several crucial design dimensions: (i) candidate-awareness in user modeling, (ii) click behavior fusion, and (iii) training objectives. Our findings challenge the status quo in neural news recommendation. We show that replacing sizable user encoders with parameter-efficient dot products between candidate and clicked news embeddings (late fusion) often yields substantial performance gains.

Since all participants can directly influence the systems by uploading gradients, FedRecs are vulnerable to poisoning attacks of malicious clients. However, most existing poisoning attacks on FedRecs are either based on some prior knowledge or with less effectiveness. To reveal the real vulnerability of FedRecs, in this paper, we present a new poisoning attack method to manipulate target items' ranks and exposure rates effectively in the top-$K$ recommendation without relying on any prior knowledge. Specifically, our attack manipulates target items' exposure rate by a group of synthetic malicious users who upload poisoned gradients considering target items' alternative products. We conduct extensive experiments with two widely used FedRecs (Fed-NCF and Fed-LightGCN) on two real-world recommendation datasets. The experimental results show that our attack can significantly improve the exposure rate of unpopular target items with extremely fewer malicious users and fewer global epochs than state-of-the-art attacks. In addition to disclosing the security hole, we design a novel countermeasure for poisoning attacks on FedRecs. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical gradient clipping with sparsified updating to defend against existing poisoning attacks.

{"title":"ETPNav: Evolving Topological Planning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments","abstract":"Vision-language navigation is a task that requires an agent to follow instructions to navigate in environments. It becomes increasingly crucial in the field of embodied AI, with potential applications in autonomous navigation, search and rescue, and human-robot interaction. In this paper, we propose to address a more practical yet challenging counterpart setting - vision-language navigation in continuous environments (VLN-CE). To develop a robust VLN-CE agent, we propose a new navigation framework, ETPNav, which focuses on two critical skills: 1) the capability to abstract environments and generate long-range navigation plans, and 2) the ability of obstacle-avoiding control in continuous environments. ETPNav performs online topological mapping of environments by self-organizing predicted waypoints along a traversed path, without prior environmental experience. It privileges the agent to break down the navigation procedure into high-level planning and low-level control. Concurrently, ETPNav utilizes a transformer-based cross-modal planner to generate navigation plans based on topological maps and instructions. The plan is then performed through an obstacle-avoiding controller that leverages a trial-and-error heuristic to prevent navigation from getting stuck in obstacles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ETPNav yields more than 10% and 20% improvements over prior state-of-the-art on R2R-CE and RxR-CE datasets, respectively.

In this tutorial, we focus on data processing on FPGAs, a technology that has received less attention than, e.g., TPUs or GPUs but that is, however, increasingly being deployed in the cloud for data processing tasks due to the architectural flexibility of FPGAs, along with their ability to process data at line rate, something not possible with other types of processors or accelerators.

{"title":"Revisiting Dense Retrieval with Unanswerable Counterfactuals","abstract":"The retriever-reader framework is popular for open-domain question answering (ODQA), where a retriever samples for the reader a set of relevant candidate passages from a large corpus. A key assumption behind this method is that high relevance scores from the retriever likely indicate high answerability from the reader, which implies a high probability that the retrieved passages contain answers to a given question. In this work, we empirically dispel this belief and observe that recent dense retrieval models based on DPR often rank unanswerable counterfactual passages higher than their answerable original passages. To address such answer-unawareness in dense retrievers, we seek to use counterfactual samples as additional training resources to better synchronize the relevance measurement of DPR with the answerability of question-passage pairs. Specifically, we present counterfactually-Pivoting Contrastive Learning (PiCL), a novel representation learning approach for passage retrieval that leverages counterfactual samples as pivots between positive and negative samples in their learned embedding space. We incorporate PiCL into the retriever training to show the effectiveness of PiCL on ODQA benchmarks and the robustness of the learned models.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03031v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"TagGPT: Large Language Models are Zero-shot Multimodal Taggers","abstract":"Tags are pivotal in facilitating the effective distribution of multimedia content in various applications in the contemporary Internet era, such as search engines and recommendation systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks. In this work, we propose TagGPT, a fully automated system capable of tag extraction and multimodal tagging in a completely zero-shot fashion. Our core insight is that, through elaborate prompt engineering, LLMs are able to extract and reason about proper tags given textual clues of multimodal data, e.g., OCR, ASR, title, etc. Specifically, to automatically build a high-quality tag set that reflects user intent and interests for a specific application, TagGPT predicts large-scale candidate tags from a series of raw data via prompting LLMs, filtered with frequency and semantics. Given a new entity that needs tagging for distribution, TagGPT introduces two alternative options for zero-shot tagging, i.e., a generative method with late semantic matching with the tag set, and another selective method with early matching in prompts. It is well noticed that TagGPT provides a system-level solution based on a modular framework equipped with a pre-trained LLM (GPT-3.5 used here) and a sentence embedding model (SimCSE used here), which can be seamlessly replaced with any more advanced one you want. TagGPT is applicable for various modalities of data in modern social media and showcases strong generalization ability to a wide range of applications.

Existing methods are often limited in scope and use optimality criteria (e.g., A-optimality) with well-known deficiencies, such as lack of invariance to the measurement-scale of the data and parameterisation of the model. A unified theory of optimal subsampling design is still lacking. We present a theory of optimal design for general data subsampling problems, including finite population inference, parametric density estimation, and regression modelling. Our theory encompasses and generalises most existing methods in the field of optimal subdata selection based on unequal probability sampling and inverse probability weighting. We derive optimality conditions for a general class of optimality criteria, and present corresponding algorithms for finding optimal sampling schemes under Poisson and multinomial sampling designs. We present a novel class of transformation- and parameterisation-invariant linear optimality criteria which enjoy the best of two worlds: the computational tractability of A-optimality and invariance properties similar to D-optimality. The methodology is illustrated on an application in the traffic safety domain. In our experiments, the proposed invariant linear optimality criteria achieve 92-99% D-efficiency with 90-95% lower computational demand. In contrast, the A-optimality criterion has only 46% and 60% D-efficiency on two of the examples.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03019v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"IoT Federated Blockchain Learning at the Edge","abstract":"IoT devices are sorely underutilized in the medical field, especially within machine learning for medicine, yet they offer unrivaled benefits. IoT devices are low-cost, energy-efficient, small and intelligent devices. In this paper, we propose a distributed federated learning framework for IoT devices, more specifically for IoMT (Internet of Medical Things), using blockchain to allow for a decentralized scheme improving privacy and efficiency over a centralized system; this allows us to move from the cloud-based architectures, that are prevalent, to the edge. The system is designed for three paradigms: 1) Training neural networks on IoT devices to allow for collaborative training of a shared model whilst decoupling the learning from the dataset to ensure privacy. Training is performed in an online manner simultaneously amongst all participants, allowing for the training of actual data that may not have been present in a dataset collected in the traditional way and dynamically adapt the system whilst it is being trained. 2) Training of an IoMT system in a fully private manner such as to mitigate the issue with confidentiality of medical data and to build robust, and potentially bespoke, models where not much, if any, data exists. 3) Distribution of the actual network training, something federated learning itself does not do, to allow hospitals, for example, to utilize their spare computing resources to train network models.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03006v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Natural Language Robot Programming: NLP integrated with autonomous robotic grasping","abstract":"In this paper, we present a grammar-based natural language framework for robot programming, specifically for pick-and-place tasks. Our approach uses a custom dictionary of action words, designed to store together words that share meaning, allowing for easy expansion of the vocabulary by adding more action words from a lexical database. We validate our Natural Language Robot Programming (NLRP) framework through simulation and real-world experimentation, using a Franka Panda robotic arm equipped with a calibrated camera-in-hand and a microphone. Participants were asked to complete a pick-and-place task using verbal commands, which were converted into text using Google's Speech-to-Text API and processed through the NLRP framework to obtain joint space trajectories for the robot. Our results indicate that our approach has a high system usability score. The framework's dictionary can be easily extended without relying on transfer learning or large data sets. In the future, we plan to compare the presented framework with different approaches of human-assisted pick-and-place tasks via a comprehensive user study.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02993v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Spritz-PS: Validation of Synthetic Face Images Using a Large Dataset of Printed Documents","abstract":"The capability of doing effective forensic analysis on printed and scanned (PS) images is essential in many applications. PS documents may be used to conceal the artifacts of images which is due to the synthetic nature of images since these artifacts are typically present in manipulated images and the main artifacts in the synthetic images can be removed after the PS. Due to the appeal of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), synthetic face images generated with GANs models are difficult to differentiate from genuine human faces and may be used to create counterfeit identities. Additionally, since GANs models do not account for physiological constraints for generating human faces and their impact on human IRISes, distinguishing genuine from synthetic IRISes in the PS scenario becomes extremely difficult. As a result of the lack of large-scale reference IRIS datasets in the PS scenario, we aim at developing a novel dataset to become a standard for Multimedia Forensics (MFs) investigation which is available at [45]. In this paper, we provide a novel dataset made up of a large number of synthetic and natural printed IRISes taken from VIPPrint Printed and Scanned face images. We extracted irises from face images and it is possible that the model due to eyelid occlusion captured the incomplete irises. To fill the missing pixels of extracted iris, we applied techniques to discover the complex link between the iris images. To highlight the problems involved with the evaluation of the dataset's IRIS images, we conducted a large number of analyses employing Siamese Neural Networks to assess the similarities between genuine and synthetic human IRISes, such as ResNet50, Xception, VGG16, and MobileNet-v2. For instance, using the Xception network, we achieved 56.76\\% similarity of IRISes for synthetic images and 92.77% similarity of IRISes for real images.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02982v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Smart Contract and DeFi Security: Insights from Tool Evaluations and Practitioner Surveys","abstract":"The growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem built on blockchain technology and smart contracts has led to an increased demand for secure and reliable smart contract development. However, attacks targeting smart contracts are increasing, causing an estimated \\$6.45 billion in financial losses. Researchers have proposed various automated security tools to detect vulnerabilities, but their real-world impact remains uncertain.   In this paper, we aim to shed light on the effectiveness of automated security tools in identifying vulnerabilities that can lead to high-profile attacks, and their overall usage within the industry. Our comprehensive study encompasses an evaluation of five SoTA automated security tools, an analysis of 127 high-impact real-world attacks resulting in \\$2.3 billion in losses, and a survey of 49 developers and auditors working in leading DeFi protocols. Our findings reveal a stark reality: the tools could have prevented a mere 8% of the attacks in our dataset, amounting to \\$149 million out of the \\$2.3 billion in losses. Notably, all preventable attacks were related to reentrancy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, practitioners distinguish logic-related bugs and protocol layer vulnerabilities as significant threats that are not adequately addressed by existing security tools. Our results emphasize the need to develop specialized tools catering to the distinct demands and expectations of developers and auditors. Further, our study highlights the necessity for continuous advancements in security tools to effectively tackle the ever-evolving challenges confronting the DeFi ecosystem.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02981v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"On the Limits of Cross-Authentication Checks for GNSS Signals","abstract":"Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are implementing security mechanisms: examples are Galileo open service navigation message authentication (OS-NMA) and GPS chips-message robust authentication (CHIMERA). Each of these mechanisms operates in a single band. However, nowadays, even commercial GNSS receivers typically compute the position, velocity, and time (PVT) solution using multiple constellations and signals from multiple bands at once, significantly improving both accuracy and availability. Hence, cross-authentication checks have been proposed, based on the PVT obtained from the mixture of authenticated and non-authenticated signals.   In this paper, first, we formalize the models for the cross-authentication checks. Next, we describe, for each check, a spoofing attack to generate a fake signal leading the victim to a target PVT without notice. We analytically relate the degrees of the freedom of the attacker in manipulating the victim's solution to both the employed security checks and the number of open signals that can be tampered with by the attacker. We test the performance of the considered attack strategies on an experimental dataset. Lastly, we show the limits of the PVT-based GNSS cross-authentication checks, where both authenticated and non-authenticated signals are used.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02977v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Training a Two Layer ReLU Network Analytically","abstract":"Neural networks are usually trained with different variants of gradient descent based optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or the Adam optimizer. Recent theoretical work states that the critical points (where the gradient of the loss is zero) of two-layer ReLU networks with the square loss are not all local minima. However, in this work we will explore an algorithm for training two-layer neural networks with ReLU-like activation and the square loss that alternatively finds the critical points of the loss function analytically for one layer while keeping the other layer and the neuron activation pattern fixed. Experiments indicate that this simple algorithm can find deeper optima than Stochastic Gradient Descent or the Adam optimizer, obtaining significantly smaller training loss values on four out of the five real datasets evaluated. Moreover, the method is faster than the gradient descent methods and has virtually no tuning parameters.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02972v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Synthetic Hard Negative Samples for Contrastive Learning","abstract":"Contrastive learning has emerged as an essential approach for self-supervised learning in computer vision. The central objective of contrastive learning is to maximize the similarities between two augmented versions of the same image (positive pairs), while minimizing the similarities between different images (negative pairs). Recent studies have demonstrated that harder negative samples, i.e., those that are difficult to distinguish from anchor sample, play a more critical role in contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose a novel featurelevel method, namely sampling synthetic hard negative samples for contrastive learning (SSCL), to exploit harder negative samples more effectively. Specifically, 1) we generate more and harder negative samples by mixing negative samples, and then sample them by controlling the contrast of anchor sample with the other negative samples. 2) Considering that the negative samples obtained by sampling may have the problem of false negative samples, we further debias the negative samples. Our proposed method improves the classification performance on different image datasets and can be readily applied to existing methods.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02971v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"A Closer Look at Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation","abstract":"Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) is a complex task that involves accurately segmenting the corresponding sounding object based on audio-visual queries. Successful audio-visual learning requires two essential components: 1) an unbiased dataset with high-quality pixel-level multi-class labels, and 2) a model capable of effectively linking audio information with its corresponding visual object. However, these two requirements are only partially addressed by current methods, with training sets containing biased audio-visual data, and models that generalise poorly beyond this biased training set. In this work, we propose a new strategy to build cost-effective and relatively unbiased audio-visual semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our strategy, called Visual Post-production (VPO), explores the observation that it is not necessary to have explicit audio-visual pairs extracted from single video sources to build such benchmarks. We also refine the previously proposed AVSBench to transform it into the audio-visual semantic segmentation benchmark AVSBench-Single+. Furthermore, this paper introduces a new pixel-wise audio-visual contrastive learning method to enable a better generalisation of the model beyond the training set. We verify the validity of the VPO strategy by showing that state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained with datasets built by matching audio and visual data from different sources or with datasets containing audio and visual data from the same video source produce almost the same accuracy. Then, using the proposed VPO benchmarks and AVSBench-Single+, we show that our method produces more accurate audio-visual semantic segmentation than SOTA models. Code and dataset will be available.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02970v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"HGCC: Enhancing Hyperbolic Graph Convolution Networks on Heterogeneous Collaborative Graph for Recommendation","abstract":"Due to the naturally power-law distributed nature of user-item interaction data in recommendation tasks, hyperbolic space modeling has recently been introduced into collaborative filtering methods. Among them, hyperbolic GCN combines the advantages of GCN and hyperbolic space and achieves a surprising performance. However, these methods only partially exploit the nature of hyperbolic space in their designs due to completely random embedding initialization and an inaccurate tangent space aggregation. In addition, the data used in these works mainly focus on user-item interaction data only, which further limits the performance of the models. In this paper, we propose a hyperbolic GCN collaborative filtering model, HGCC, which improves the existing hyperbolic GCN structure for collaborative filtering and incorporates side information. It keeps the long-tailed nature of the collaborative graph by adding power law prior to node embedding initialization; then, it aggregates neighbors directly in multiple hyperbolic spaces through the gyromidpoint method to obtain more accurate computation results; finally, the gate fusion with prior is used to fuse multiple embeddings of one node from different hyperbolic space automatically. Experimental results on four real datasets show that our model is highly competitive and outperforms leading baselines, including hyperbolic GCNs. Further experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed approach and give a further explanation by the learned embedding.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02961v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"InterFormer: Real-time Interactive Image Segmentation","abstract":"Interactive image segmentation enables annotators to efficiently perform pixel-level annotation for segmentation tasks. However, the existing interactive segmentation pipeline suffers from inefficient computations of interactive models because of the following two issues. First, annotators' later click is based on models' feedback of annotators' former click. This serial interaction is unable to utilize model's parallelism capabilities. Second, the model has to repeatedly process the image, the annotator's current click, and the model's feedback of the annotator's former clicks at each step of interaction, resulting in redundant computations. For efficient computation, we propose a method named InterFormer that follows a new pipeline to address these issues. InterFormer extracts and preprocesses the computationally time-consuming part i.e. image processing from the existing process. Specifically, InterFormer employs a large vision transformer (ViT) on high-performance devices to preprocess images in parallel, and then uses a lightweight module called interactive multi-head self attention (I-MSA) for interactive segmentation. Furthermore, the I-MSA module's deployment on low-power devices extends the practical application of interactive segmentation. The I-MSA module utilizes the preprocessed features to efficiently response to the annotator inputs in real-time. The experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of InterFormer, which outperforms previous interactive segmentation models in terms of computational efficiency and segmentation quality, achieve real-time high-quality interactive segmentation on CPU-only devices.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02942v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"All Keypoints You Need: Detecting Arbitrary Keypoints on the Body of Triple, High, and Long Jump Athletes","abstract":"Performance analyses based on videos are commonly used by coaches of athletes in various sports disciplines. In individual sports, these analyses mainly comprise the body posture. This paper focuses on the disciplines of triple, high, and long jump, which require fine-grained locations of the athlete's body. Typical human pose estimation datasets provide only a very limited set of keypoints, which is not sufficient in this case. Therefore, we propose a method to detect arbitrary keypoints on the whole body of the athlete by leveraging the limited set of annotated keypoints and auto-generated segmentation masks of body parts. Evaluations show that our model is capable of detecting keypoints on the head, torso, hands, feet, arms, and legs, including also bent elbows and knees. We analyze and compare different techniques to encode desired keypoints as the model's input and their embedding for the Transformer backbone.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02939v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Boundary-Denoising for Video Activity Localization","abstract":"Video activity localization aims at understanding the semantic content in long untrimmed videos and retrieving actions of interest. The retrieved action with its start and end locations can be used for highlight generation, temporal action detection, etc. Unfortunately, learning the exact boundary location of activities is highly challenging because temporal activities are continuous in time, and there are often no clear-cut transitions between actions. Moreover, the definition of the start and end of events is subjective, which may confuse the model. To alleviate the boundary ambiguity, we propose to study the video activity localization problem from a denoising perspective. Specifically, we propose an encoder-decoder model named DenoiseLoc. During training, a set of action spans is randomly generated from the ground truth with a controlled noise scale. Then we attempt to reverse this process by boundary denoising, allowing the localizer to predict activities with precise boundaries and resulting in faster convergence speed. Experiments show that DenoiseLoc advances %in several video activity understanding tasks. For example, we observe a gain of +12.36% average mAP on QV-Highlights dataset and +1.64% mAP@0.5 on THUMOS'14 dataset over the baseline. Moreover, DenoiseLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance on TACoS and MAD datasets, but with much fewer predictions compared to other current methods.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02934v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Convolutional neural networks for crack detection on flexible road pavements","abstract":"Flexible road pavements deteriorate primarily due to traffic and adverse environmental conditions. Cracking is the most common deterioration mechanism; the surveying thereof is typically conducted manually using internationally defined classification standards.

{"title":"Mask Detection and Classification in Thermal Face Images","abstract":"Face masks are recommended to reduce the transmission of many viruses, especially SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the automatic detection of whether there is a mask on the face, what type of mask is worn, and how it is worn is an important research topic. In this work, the use of thermal imaging was considered to analyze the possibility of detecting (localizing) a mask on the face, as well as to check whether it is possible to classify the type of mask on the face. The previously proposed dataset of thermal images was extended and annotated with the description of a type of mask and a location of a mask within a face. Different deep learning models were adapted. The best model for face mask detection turned out to be the Yolov5 model in the \"nano\" version, reaching mAP higher than 97% and precision of about 95%. High accuracy was also obtained for mask type classification.

This highlights the predominance of the disease, especially in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of Africa, parts of South-east Asia, Central and Southern America. Malaria is caused due to the Plasmodium parasite which is circulated through the bites of the female Anopheles mosquito. Hence, the detection of the parasite in human blood smears could confirm malarial infestation. Since the manual identification of Plasmodium is a lengthy and time-consuming task subject to variability in accuracy, we propose an automated, computer-aided diagnostic method to classify malarial thin smear blood cell images as parasitized and uninfected by using the ResNet50 Deep Neural Network. In this paper, we have used the pre-trained ResNet50 model on the open-access database provided by the National Library of Medicine's Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communication for 150 epochs. The results obtained showed accuracy, precision, and recall values of 98.75%, 99.3% and 99.5% on the ResNet50(proposed) model.

We propose LSketch that works for heterogeneous graph streams, which effectively preserves the label information carried by the streams in real scenes, thereby enriching the expressive ability of sketches. In addition, as graph streams continue to evolve over time, edges too old may lose their practical significance.

{"title":"VPFusion: Towards Robust Vertical Representation Learning for 3D Object Detection","abstract":"Efficient point cloud representation is a fundamental element of Lidar-based 3D object detection. Recent grid-based detectors usually divide point clouds into voxels or pillars and construct single-stream networks in Bird's Eye View. However, these point cloud encoding paradigms underestimate the point representation in the vertical direction, which cause the loss of semantic or fine-grained information, especially for vertical sensitive objects like pedestrian and cyclists. In this paper, we propose an explicit vertical multi-scale representation learning framework, VPFusion, to combine the complementary information from both voxel and pillar streams. Specifically, VPFusion first builds upon a sparse voxel-pillar-based backbone. The backbone divides point clouds into voxels and pillars, then encodes features with 3D and 2D sparse convolution simultaneously. Next, we introduce the Sparse Fusion Layer (SFL), which establishes a bidirectional pathway for sparse voxel and pillar features to enable the interaction between them. Additionally, we present the Dense Fusion Neck (DFN) to effectively combine the dense feature maps from voxel and pillar branches with multi-scale.

{"title":"Learning to Learn with Indispensable Connections","abstract":"Meta-learning aims to solve unseen tasks with few labelled instances. Nevertheless, despite its effectiveness for quick learning in existing optimization-based methods, it has several flaws. Inconsequential connections are frequently seen during meta-training, which results in an over-parameterized neural network. Because of this, meta-testing observes unnecessary computations and extra memory overhead. To overcome such flaws. We propose a novel meta-learning method called Meta-LTH that includes indispensible (necessary) connections. We applied the lottery ticket hypothesis technique known as magnitude pruning to generate these crucial connections that can effectively solve few-shot learning problem. We aim to perform two things: (a) to find a sub-network capable of more adaptive meta-learning and (b) to learn new low-level features of unseen tasks and recombine those features with the already learned features during the meta-test phase. Experimental results show that our proposed Met-LTH method outperformed existing first-order MAML algorithm for three different classification datasets. Our method improves the classification accuracy by approximately 2% (20-way 1-shot task setting) for omniglot dataset.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02862v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"Towards an Effective and Efficient Transformer for Rain-by-snow Weather Removal","abstract":"Rain-by-snow weather removal is a specialized task in weather-degraded image restoration aiming to eliminate coexisting rain streaks and snow particles. In this paper, we propose RSFormer, an efficient and effective Transformer that addresses this challenge. Initially, we explore the proximity of convolution networks (ConvNets) and vision Transformers (ViTs) in hierarchical architectures and experimentally find they perform approximately at intra-stage feature learning. On this basis, we utilize a Transformer-like convolution block (TCB) that replaces the computationally expensive self-attention while preserving attention characteristics for adapting to input content. We also demonstrate that cross-stage progression is critical for performance improvement, and propose a global-local self-attention sampling mechanism (GLASM) that down-/up-samples features while capturing both global and local dependencies. Finally, we synthesize two novel rain-by-snow datasets, RSCityScape and RS100K, to evaluate our proposed RSFormer. Extensive experiments verify that RSFormer achieves the best trade-off between performance and time-consumption compared to other restoration methods. For instance, it outperforms Restormer with a 1.53% reduction in the number of parameters and a 15.6% reduction in inference time.

{"title":"A review of ensemble learning and data augmentation models for class imbalanced problems: combination, implementation and evaluation","abstract":"Class imbalance (CI) in classification problems arises when the number of observations belonging to one class is lower than the other classes. Ensemble learning that combines multiple models to obtain a robust model has been prominently used with data augmentation methods to address class imbalance problems. In the last decade, a number of strategies have been added to enhance ensemble learning and data augmentation methods, along with new methods such as generative adversarial networks (GANs). A combination of these has been applied in many studies, but the true rank of different combinations would require a computational review. In this paper, we present a computational review to evaluate data augmentation and ensemble learning methods used to address prominent benchmark CI problems. We propose a general framework that evaluates 10 data augmentation and 10 ensemble learning methods for CI problems. Our objective was to identify the most effective combination for improving classification performance on imbalanced datasets. The results indicate that combinations of data augmentation methods with ensemble learning can significantly improve classification performance on imbalanced datasets. These findings have important implications for the development of more effective approaches for handling imbalanced datasets in machine learning applications.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02858v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Optimization of probabilistic quantum search algorithm with a priori information","abstract":"A quantum computer encodes information in quantum states and runs quantum algorithms to surpass the classical counterparts by exploiting quantum superposition and quantum correlation. Grover's quantum search algorithm is a typical quantum algorithm that proves the superiority of quantum computing over classical computing. It has a quadratic reduction in the query complexity of database search, and is known to be optimal when no a priori information about the elements of the database is provided. In this work, we consider a probabilistic Grover's search algorithm allowing nonzero probability of failure for a database with general a priori probability distribution of the elements, and minimize the number of oracle calls by optimizing the initial state of the quantum system and the reflection axis of the diffusion operator. The initial state and the reflection axis are allowed not to coincide, and thus the quantum search algorithm rotates the quantum system in a three-dimensional subspace spanned by the initial state, the reflection axis and the search target state. The number of oracle calls is minimized by a variational method, and formal analytical results are obtained with the assumption of low failure probability. The results show that for nonuniform a priori distribution of the oracle elements, the number of oracle calls can be significantly reduced given a small decrease in the success probability of the quantum search algorithm, leading to a lower average number of oracle calls to find the solution of the search problem. The result is applied to a simple but nontrivial database model which has $N$ elements with nonuniform two-valued a priori probabilities to show the effect of the optimized search algorithm. The paper is concluded with a discussion about the generalization to higher-order results that allows a larger failure probability for the quantum search algorithm.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02856v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"SS-shapelets: Semi-supervised Clustering of Time Series Using Representative Shapelets","abstract":"Shapelets that discriminate time series using local features (subsequences) are promising for time series clustering. Existing time series clustering methods may fail to capture representative shapelets because they discover shapelets from a large pool of uninformative subsequences, and thus result in low clustering accuracy. This paper proposes a Semi-supervised Clustering of Time Series Using Representative Shapelets (SS-Shapelets) method, which utilizes a small number of labeled and propagated pseudo-labeled time series to help discover representative shapelets, thereby improving the clustering accuracy. In SS-Shapelets, we propose two techniques to discover representative shapelets for the effective clustering of time series. 1) A \\textit{salient subsequence chain} ($SSC$) that can extract salient subsequences (as candidate shapelets) of a labeled/pseudo-labeled time series, which helps remove massive uninformative subsequences from the pool. 2) A \\textit{linear discriminant selection} ($LDS$) algorithm to identify shapelets that can capture representative local features of time series in different classes, for convenient clustering. Experiments on UCR time series datasets demonstrate that SS-shapelets discovers representative shapelets and achieves higher clustering accuracy than counterpart semi-supervised time series clustering methods.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03292v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

We show that this type of regularization improves robustness on a range of benchmarks such as Imagenet-C and Stylized Imagenet. It adds little computational overhead and, furthermore, does not require a priori knowledge of a large set of image transformations. We find that this approach further complements recent advances in model architecture and data augmentation, attaining a state-of-the-art mCE of 44.8 with an EfficientNet-B8 model and RandAugment, which is a reduction of 16 mCE compared to the baseline.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02847v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"NTK-SAP: Improving neural network pruning by aligning training dynamics","abstract":"Pruning neural networks before training has received increasing interest due to its potential to reduce training time and memory. One popular method is to prune the connections based on a certain metric, but it is not entirely clear what metric is the best choice. Recent advances in neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory suggest that the training dynamics of large enough neural networks is closely related to the spectrum of the NTK. Motivated by this finding, we propose to prune the connections that have the least influence on the spectrum of the NTK. This method can help maintain the NTK spectrum, which may help align the training dynamics to that of its dense counterpart. However, one possible issue is that the fixed-weight-NTK corresponding to a given initial point can be very different from the NTK corresponding to later iterates during the training phase. We further propose to sample multiple realizations of random weights to estimate the NTK spectrum. Note that our approach is weight-agnostic, which is different from most existing methods that are weight-dependent. In addition, we use random inputs to compute the fixed-weight-NTK, making our method data-agnostic as well. We name our foresight pruning algorithm Neural Tangent Kernel Spectrum-Aware Pruning (NTK-SAP). Empirically, our method achieves better performance than all baselines on multiple datasets.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02840v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

Considering that provenance graphs provide rich historical information and have the powerful attacks historic correlation ability to identify anomalous activities, TBDetector employs provenance analysis for APT detection, which summarizes long-running system execution with space efficiency and utilizes transformer with self-attention based encoder-decoder to extract long-term contextual features of system states to detect slow-acting attacks. Furthermore, we further introduce anomaly scores to investigate the anomaly of different system states, where each state is calculated with an anomaly score corresponding to its similarity score and isolation score. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have conducted experiments on five public datasets, i.e., streamspot, cadets, shellshock, clearscope, and wget_baseline. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have exhibited better performance of our proposed method.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02838v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Longitudinal Multimodal Transformer Integrating Imaging and Latent Clinical Signatures From Routine EHRs for Pulmonary Nodule Classification","abstract":"The accuracy of predictive models for solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) diagnosis can be greatly increased by incorporating repeat imaging and medical context, such as electronic health records (EHRs). However, clinically routine modalities such as imaging and diagnostic codes can be asynchronous and irregularly sampled over different time scales which are obstacles to longitudinal multimodal learning. In this work, we propose a transformer-based multimodal strategy to integrate repeat imaging with longitudinal clinical signatures from routinely collected EHRs for SPN classification. We perform unsupervised disentanglement of latent clinical signatures and leverage time-distance scaled self-attention to jointly learn from clinical signatures expressions and chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Our classifier is pretrained on 2,668 scans from a public dataset and 1,149 subjects with longitudinal chest CTs, billing codes, medications, and laboratory tests from EHRs of our home institution. Evaluation on 227 subjects with challenging SPNs revealed a significant AUC improvement over a longitudinal multimodal baseline (0.824 vs 0.752 AUC), as well as improvements over a single cross-section multimodal scenario (0.809 AUC) and a longitudinal imaging-only scenario (0.741 AUC). This work demonstrates significant advantages with a novel approach for co-learning longitudinal imaging and non-imaging phenotypes with transformers.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02836v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"GIF: A General Graph Unlearning Strategy via Influence Function","abstract":"With the greater emphasis on privacy and security in our society, the problem of graph unlearning -- revoking the influence of specific data on the trained GNN model, is drawing increasing attention. However, ranging from machine unlearning to recently emerged graph unlearning methods, existing efforts either resort to retraining paradigm, or perform approximate erasure that fails to consider the inter-dependency between connected neighbors or imposes constraints on GNN structure, therefore hard to achieve satisfying performance-complexity trade-offs.   In this work, we explore the influence function tailored for graph unlearning, so as to improve the unlearning efficacy and efficiency for graph unlearning. We first present a unified problem formulation of diverse graph unlearning tasks \\wrt node, edge, and feature. Then, we recognize the crux to the inability of traditional influence function for graph unlearning, and devise Graph Influence Function (GIF), a model-agnostic unlearning method that can efficiently and accurately estimate parameter changes in response to a $\\epsilon$-mass perturbation in deleted data. The idea is to supplement the objective of the traditional influence function with an additional loss term of the influenced neighbors due to the structural dependency. Further deductions on the closed-form solution of parameter changes provide a better understanding of the unlearning mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on four representative GNN models and three benchmark datasets to justify the superiority of GIF for diverse graph unlearning tasks in terms of unlearning efficacy, model utility, and unlearning efficiency.

{"title":"DoUnseen: Zero-Shot Object Detection for Robotic Grasping","abstract":"How can we segment varying numbers of objects where each specific object represents its own separate class? To make the problem even more realistic, how can we add and delete classes on the fly without retraining? This is the case of robotic applications where no datasets of the objects exist or application that includes thousands of objects (E.g., in logistics) where it is impossible to train a single model to learn all of the objects. Most current research on object segmentation for robotic grasping focuses on class-level object segmentation (E.g., box, cup, bottle), closed sets (specific objects of a dataset; for example, YCB dataset), or deep learning-based template matching. In this work, we are interested in open sets where the number of classes is unknown, varying, and without pre-knowledge about the objects' types. We consider each specific object as its own separate class. Our goal is to develop a zero-shot object detector that requires no training and can add any object as a class just by capturing a few images of the object. Our main idea is to break the segmentation pipelines into two steps by combining unseen object segmentation networks cascaded by zero-shot classifiers. We evaluate our zero-shot object detector on unseen datasets and compare it to a trained Mask R-CNN on those datasets. The results show that the performance varies from practical to unsuitable depending on the environment setup and the objects being handled.

Our second contribution is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the annotations, focusing on how different demographic groups are represented. Our last contribution lies in evaluating three prevailing vision-and-language tasks: image captioning, text-image CLIP embeddings, and text-to-image generation, showing that societal bias is a persistent problem in all of them.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02828v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Pragmatically Appropriate Diversity for Dialogue Evaluation","abstract":"Linguistic pragmatics state that a conversation's underlying speech acts can constrain the type of response which is appropriate at each turn in the conversation. When generating dialogue responses, neural dialogue agents struggle to produce diverse responses. Currently, dialogue diversity is assessed using automatic metrics, but the underlying speech acts do not inform these metrics.   To remedy this, we propose the notion of Pragmatically Appropriate Diversity, defined as the extent to which a conversation creates and constrains the creation of multiple diverse responses. Using a human-created multi-response dataset, we find significant support for the hypothesis that speech acts provide a signal for the diversity of the set of next responses. Building on this result, we propose a new human evaluation task where creative writers predict the extent to which conversations inspire the creation of multiple diverse responses. Our studies find that writers' judgments align with the Pragmatically Appropriate Diversity of conversations. Our work suggests that expectations for diversity metric scores should vary depending on the speech act.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02812v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"Source-free Domain Adaptation Requires Penalized Diversity","abstract":"While neural networks are capable of achieving human-like performance in many tasks such as image classification, the impressive performance of each model is limited to its own dataset. Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) was introduced to address knowledge transfer between different domains in the absence of source data, thus, increasing data privacy. Diversity in representation space can be vital to a model`s adaptability in varied and difficult domains. In unsupervised SFDA, the diversity is limited to learning a single hypothesis on the source or learning multiple hypotheses with a shared feature extractor. Motivated by the improved predictive performance of ensembles, we propose a novel unsupervised SFDA algorithm that promotes representational diversity through the use of separate feature extractors with Distinct Backbone Architectures (DBA). Although diversity in feature space is increased, the unconstrained mutual information (MI) maximization may potentially introduce amplification of weak hypotheses. Thus we introduce the Weak Hypothesis Penalization (WHP) regularizer as a mitigation strategy. Our work proposes Penalized Diversity (PD) where the synergy of DBA and WHP is applied to unsupervised source-free domain adaptation for covariate shift. In addition, PD is augmented with a weighted MI maximization objective for label distribution shift. Empirical results on natural, synthetic, and medical domains demonstrate the effectiveness of PD under different distributional shifts.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02798v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Context-Aware Classification of Legal Document Pages","abstract":"For many business applications that require the processing, indexing, and retrieval of professional documents such as legal briefs (in PDF format etc.), it is often essential to classify the pages of any given document into their corresponding types beforehand. Most existing studies in the field of document image classification either focus on single-page documents or treat multiple pages in a document independently. Although in recent years a few techniques have been proposed to exploit the context information from neighboring pages to enhance document page classification, they typically cannot be utilized with large pre-trained language models due to the constraint on input length. In this paper, we present a simple but effective approach that overcomes the above limitation. Specifically, we enhance the input with extra tokens carrying sequential information about previous pages - introducing recurrence - which enables the usage of pre-trained Transformer models like BERT for context-aware page classification. Our experiments conducted on two legal datasets in English and Portuguese respectively show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of document page classification compared to the non-recurrent setup as well as the other context-aware baselines.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02787v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"FACE-AUDITOR: Data Auditing in Facial Recognition Systems","abstract":"Few-shot-based facial recognition systems have gained increasing attention due to their scalability and ability to work with a few face images during the model deployment phase. However, the power of facial recognition systems enables entities with moderate resources to canvas the Internet and build well-performed facial recognition models without people's awareness and consent. To prevent the face images from being misused, one straightforward approach is to modify the raw face images before sharing them, which inevitably destroys the semantic information, increases the difficulty of retroactivity, and is still prone to adaptive attacks. Therefore, an auditing method that does not interfere with the facial recognition model's utility and cannot be quickly bypassed is urgently needed.   In this paper, we formulate the auditing process as a user-level membership inference problem and propose a complete toolkit FACE-AUDITOR that can carefully choose the probing set to query the few-shot-based facial recognition model and determine whether any of a user's face images is used in training the model. We further propose to use the similarity scores between the original face images as reference information to improve the auditing performance. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world face image datasets show that FACE-AUDITOR can achieve auditing accuracy of up to $99\\%$. Finally, we show that FACE-AUDITOR is robust in the presence of several perturbation mechanisms to the training images or the target models.

However, despite the success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in medical image segmentation, they still face challenges in handling fine-scale features and variations in image scales. These challenges are particularly evident in complex and challenging segmentation tasks, such as the BraTS multi-label brain tumor segmentation challenge. In this task, accurately segmenting the various tumor sub-components, which vary significantly in size and shape, remains a significant challenge, with even state-of-the-art methods producing substantial errors. Therefore, we propose two architectures, FMG-Net and W-Net, that incorporate the principles of geometric multigrid methods for solving linear systems of equations into CNNs to address these challenges. Our experiments on the BraTS 2020 dataset demonstrate that both FMG-Net and W-Net outperform the widely used U-Net architecture regarding tumor subcomponent segmentation accuracy and training efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating the principles of multigrid methods into CNNs to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical imaging segmentation.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02725v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

This study investigates the utility of self-supervised pretraining prior to conducting supervised fine-tuning for the downstream task of lung sliding classification in M-mode lung ultrasound images. We propose a novel pairwise relationship that couples M-mode images constructed from the same B-mode image and investigate the utility of data augmentation procedure specific to M-mode lung ultrasound. The results indicate that self-supervised pretraining yields better performance than full supervision, most notably for feature extractors not initialized with ImageNet-pretrained weights. Moreover, we observe that including a vast volume of unlabelled data results in improved performance on external validation datasets, underscoring the value of self-supervision for improving generalizability in automatic ultrasound interpretation. To the authors' best knowledge, this study is the first to characterize the influence of self-supervised pretraining for M-mode ultrasound.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02724v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

Still, model sizes can make deployment in latency-sensitive or web-scale implementations difficult. This paper studies the relationship between model size, structured pruning, inference efficiency, and summarization accuracy on widely used summarization datasets. We show that model accuracy is tied to the encoder size while inference efficiency is connected to the decoder. Using asymmetric pruning can lead to nearly 3x improvement in inference latency with ~1 point loss in Rouge-2. Moreover, we find both the average degradation and the role of asymmetry to be consistent across model sizes and variations in datasets.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02721v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Domain Generalization with Adversarial Intensity Attack for Medical Image Segmentation","abstract":"Most statistical learning algorithms rely on an over-simplified assumption, that is, the train and test data are independent and identically distributed. In real-world scenarios, however, it is common for models to encounter data from new and different domains to which they were not exposed to during training. This is often the case in medical imaging applications due to differences in acquisition devices, imaging protocols, and patient characteristics. To address this problem, domain generalization (DG) is a promising direction as it enables models to handle data from previously unseen domains by learning domain-invariant features robust to variations across different domains. To this end, we introduce a novel DG method called Adversarial Intensity Attack (AdverIN), which leverages adversarial training to generate training data with an infinite number of styles and increase data diversity while preserving essential content information. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on various multi-domain segmentation datasets, including 2D retinal fundus optic disc/cup and 3D prostate MRI. Our results demonstrate that AdverIN significantly improves the generalization ability of the segmentation models, achieving significant improvement on these challenging datasets.

We also incorporate a set of spatial-temporal knowledge to regularize the learning of such a sequence-to-sequence model. We collect a set of challenging aerial videos and compare the proposed method to the alternative algorithms.

In this work, we present a novel variant of the Unet model called the NUMSnet that transmits pixel neighborhood features across scans through nested layers to achieve accurate multi-class semantic segmentations with minimal training data. We analyze the semantic segmentation performance of the NUMSnet model in comparison with several Unet model variants to segment 3-7 regions of interest using only 10% of images for training per Lung-CT and Heart-CT volumetric image stacks. The proposed NUMSnet model achieves up to 20% improvement in segmentation recall with 4-9% improvement in Dice scores for Lung-CT stacks and 2.5-10% improvement in Dice scores for Heart-CT stacks when compared to the Unet++ model. The NUMSnet model needs to be trained by ordered images around the central scan of each volumetric stack. Propagation of image feature information from the 6 nested layers of the Unet++ model are found to have better computation and segmentation performances than propagation of all up-sampling layers in a Unet++ model. The NUMSnet model achieves comparable segmentation performances to existing works, while being trained on as low as 5\\% of the training images. Also, transfer learning allows faster convergence of the NUMSnet model for multi-class semantic segmentation from pathology in Lung-CT images to cardiac segmentations in Heart-CT stacks. Thus, the proposed model can standardize multi-class semantic segmentation on a variety of volumetric image stacks with minimal training dataset. This can significantly reduce the cost, time and inter-observer variabilities associated with computer-aided detections and treatment.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02713v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Structured prompt interrogation and recursive extraction of semantics (SPIRES): A method for populating knowledge bases using zero-shot learning","abstract":"Creating knowledge bases and ontologies is a time consuming task that relies on a manual curation. AI/NLP approaches can assist expert curators in populating these knowledge bases, but current approaches rely on extensive training data, and are not able to populate arbitrary complex nested knowledge schemas.   Here we present Structured Prompt Interrogation and Recursive Extraction of Semantics (SPIRES), a Knowledge Extraction approach that relies on the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot learning (ZSL) and general-purpose query answering from flexible prompts and return information conforming to a specified schema. Given a detailed, user-defined knowledge schema and an input text, SPIRES recursively performs prompt interrogation against GPT-3+ to obtain a set of responses matching the provided schema. SPIRES uses existing ontologies and vocabularies to provide identifiers for all matched elements.   We present examples of use of SPIRES in different domains, including extraction of food recipes, multi-species cellular signaling pathways, disease treatments, multi-step drug mechanisms, and chemical to disease causation graphs. Current SPIRES accuracy is comparable to the mid-range of existing Relation Extraction (RE) methods, but has the advantage of easy customization, flexibility, and, crucially, the ability to perform new tasks in the absence of any training data. This method supports a general strategy of leveraging the language interpreting capabilities of LLMs to assemble knowledge bases, assisting manual knowledge curation and acquisition while supporting validation with publicly-available databases and ontologies external to the LLM.

To achieve this end, an Implicit Video Function (IVF) is learned to represent a single motion blurred image with concurrent events, enabling the latent sharp image restoration of arbitrary timestamps in the range of imaging exposures. Specifically, a dual attention transformer is proposed to efficiently leverage merits from both modalities, i.e., the high temporal resolution of event features and the smoothness of image features, alleviating temporal ambiguities while suppressing the event noise. The proposed network is trained only with the supervision of ground-truth images of limited referenced timestamps. Motion- and texture-guided supervisions are employed simultaneously to enhance restorations of the non-referenced timestamps and improve the overall sharpness.

{"title":"A Certified Radius-Guided Attack Framework to Image Segmentation Models","abstract":"Image segmentation is an important problem in many safety-critical applications. Recent studies show that modern image segmentation models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, while existing attack methods mainly follow the idea of attacking image classification models. We argue that image segmentation and classification have inherent differences, and design an attack framework specially for image segmentation models. Our attack framework is inspired by certified radius, which was originally used by defenders to defend against adversarial perturbations to classification models. We are the first, from the attacker perspective, to leverage the properties of certified radius and propose a certified radius guided attack framework against image segmentation models. Specifically, we first adapt randomized smoothing, the state-of-the-art certification method for classification models, to derive the pixel's certified radius. We then focus more on disrupting pixels with relatively smaller certified radii and design a pixel-wise certified radius guided loss, when plugged into any existing white-box attack, yields our certified radius-guided white-box attack. Next, we propose the first black-box attack to image segmentation models via bandit. We design a novel gradient estimator, based on bandit feedback, which is query-efficient and provably unbiased and stable. We use this gradient estimator to design a projected bandit gradient descent (PBGD) attack, as well as a certified radius-guided PBGD (CR-PBGD) attack. We prove our PBGD and CR-PBGD attacks can achieve asymptotically optimal attack performance with an optimal rate. We evaluate our certified-radius guided white-box and black-box attacks on multiple modern image segmentation models and datasets. Our results validate the effectiveness of our certified radius-guided attack framework.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02693v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"High-fidelity Pseudo-labels for Boosting Weakly-Supervised Segmentation","abstract":"The task of image-level weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has gained popularity in recent years, as it reduces the vast data annotation cost for training segmentation models. The typical approach for WSSS involves training an image classification network using global average pooling (GAP) on convolutional feature maps. This enables the estimation of object locations based on class activation maps (CAMs), which identify the importance of image regions. The CAMs are then used to generate pseudo-labels, in the form of segmentation masks, to supervise a segmentation model in the absence of pixel-level ground truth. In case of the SEAM baseline, a previous work proposed to improve CAM learning in two ways: (1) Importance sampling, which is a substitute for GAP, and (2) the feature similarity loss, which utilizes a heuristic that object contours almost exclusively align with color edges in images. In this work, we propose a different probabilistic interpretation of CAMs for these techniques, rendering the likelihood more appropriate than the multinomial posterior. As a result, we propose an add-on method that can boost essentially any previous WSSS method, improving both the region similarity and contour quality of all implemented state-of-the-art baselines. This is demonstrated on a wide variety of baselines on the PASCAL VOC dataset. Experiments on the MS COCO dataset show that performance gains can also be achieved in a large-scale setting.

While various deepfake detection and text fake news detection methods have been proposed, they are only designed for single-modality forgery based on binary classification, let alone analyzing and reasoning subtle forgery traces across different modalities. In this paper, we highlight a new research problem for multi-modal fake media, namely Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM^4). DGM^4 aims to not only detect the authenticity of multi-modal media, but also ground the manipulated content (i.e., image bounding boxes and text tokens), which requires deeper reasoning of multi-modal media manipulation. To support a large-scale investigation, we construct the first DGM^4 dataset, where image-text pairs are manipulated by various approaches, with rich annotation of diverse manipulations.

Our new goal-conditioned policy architecture \"$\\textbf{BE}$havior generation with $\\textbf{S}$c$\\textbf{O}$re-based Diffusion Policies\" (BESO) leverages a generative, score-based diffusion model as its policy. BESO decouples the learning of the score model from the inference sampling process, and, hence allows for fast sampling strategies to generate goal-specified behavior in just 3 denoising steps, compared to 30+ steps of other diffusion based policies. Furthermore, BESO is highly expressive and can effectively capture multi-modality present in the solution space of the play data. Unlike previous methods such as Latent Plans or C-Bet, BESO does not rely on complex hierarchical policies or additional clustering for effective goal-conditioned behavior learning.

{"title":"Learning to Compare Longitudinal Images","abstract":"Longitudinal studies, where a series of images from the same set of individuals are acquired at different time-points, represent a popular technique for studying and characterizing temporal dynamics in biomedical applications. The classical approach for longitudinal comparison involves normalizing for nuisance variations, such as image orientation or contrast differences, via pre-processing. Statistical analysis is, in turn, conducted to detect changes of interest, either at the individual or population level. This classical approach can suffer from pre-processing issues and limitations of the statistical modeling. For example, normalizing for nuisance variation might be hard in settings where there are a lot of idiosyncratic changes. In this paper, we present a simple machine learning-based approach that can alleviate these issues. In our approach, we train a deep learning model (called PaIRNet, for Pairwise Image Ranking Network) to compare pairs of longitudinal images, with or without supervision. In the self-supervised setup, for instance, the model is trained to temporally order the images, which requires learning to recognize time-irreversible changes.

By adapting recent work on computing intrinsic dimensionalities, our method is able to select the features that can discriminate data and thus weaken the curse of dimensionality.

Unlike existing works that generate dance movements using a single modality such as music, our goal is to produce richer dance movements guided by the instructive information provided by the text. However, the lack of paired motion data with both music and text modalities limits the ability to generate dance movements that integrate both. To alleviate this challenge, we propose to utilize a 3D human motion VQ-VAE to project the motions of the two datasets into a latent space consisting of quantized vectors, which effectively mix the motion tokens from the two datasets with different distributions for training. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal transformer to integrate text instructions into motion generation architecture for generating 3D dance movements without degrading the performance of music-conditioned dance generation.

Extensive experiments show that our approach can generate realistic and coherent dance movements conditioned on both text and music while maintaining comparable performance with the two single modalities.

{"title":"Quiz-based Knowledge Tracing","abstract":"Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to assess individuals' evolving knowledge states according to their learning interactions with different exercises in online learning systems (OIS), which is critical in supporting decision-making for subsequent intelligent services, such as personalized learning source recommendation. Existing researchers have broadly studied KT and developed many effective methods. However, most of them assume that students' historical interactions are uniformly distributed in a continuous sequence, ignoring the fact that actual interaction sequences are organized based on a series of quizzes with clear boundaries, where interactions within a quiz are consecutively completed, but interactions across different quizzes are discrete and may be spaced over days. In this paper, we present the Quiz-based Knowledge Tracing (QKT) model to monitor students' knowledge states according to their quiz-based learning interactions. Specifically, as students' interactions within a quiz are continuous and have the same or similar knowledge concepts, we design the adjacent gate followed by a global average pooling layer to capture the intra-quiz short-term knowledge influence. Then, as various quizzes tend to focus on different knowledge concepts, we respectively measure the inter-quiz knowledge substitution by the gated recurrent unit and the inter-quiz knowledge complementarity by the self-attentive encoder with a novel recency-aware attention mechanism. Finally, we integrate the inter-quiz long-term knowledge substitution and complementarity across different quizzes to output students' evolving knowledge states. Extensive experimental results on three public real-world datasets demonstrate that QKT achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Further analyses confirm that QKT is promising in designing more effective quizzes.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02413v2","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"PrivGraph: Differentially Private Graph Data Publication by Exploiting Community Information","abstract":"Graph data is used in a wide range of applications, while analyzing graph data without protection is prone to privacy breach risks. To mitigate the privacy risks, we resort to the standard technique of differential privacy to publish a synthetic graph. However, existing differentially private graph synthesis approaches either introduce excessive noise by directly perturbing the adjacency matrix, or suffer significant information loss during the graph encoding process. In this paper, we propose an effective graph synthesis algorithm PrivGraph by exploiting the community information. Concretely, PrivGraph differentially privately partitions the private graph into communities, extracts intra-community and inter-community information, and reconstructs the graph from the extracted graph information. We validate the effectiveness of PrivGraph on six real-world graph datasets and seven commonly used graph metrics.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02401v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"How good Neural Networks interpretation methods really are? A quantitative benchmark","abstract":"Saliency Maps (SMs) have been extensively used to interpret deep learning models decision by highlighting the features deemed relevant by the model. They are used on highly nonlinear problems, where linear feature selection (FS) methods fail at highlighting relevant explanatory variables. However, the reliability of gradient-based feature attribution methods such as SM has mostly been only qualitatively (visually) assessed, and quantitative benchmarks are currently missing, partially due to the lack of a definite ground truth on image data. Concerned about the apophenic biases introduced by visual assessment of these methods, in this paper we propose a synthetic quantitative benchmark for Neural Networks (NNs) interpretation methods. For this purpose, we built synthetic datasets with nonlinearly separable classes and increasing number of decoy (random) features, illustrating the challenge of FS in high-dimensional settings. We also compare these methods to conventional approaches such as mRMR or Random Forests. Our results show that our simple synthetic datasets are sufficient to challenge most of the benchmarked methods. TreeShap, mRMR and LassoNet are the best performing FS methods. We also show that, when quantifying the relevance of a few non linearly-entangled predictive features diluted in a large number of irrelevant noisy variables, neural network-based FS and interpretation methods are still far from being reliable.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02383v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"What's in a Name? Beyond Class Indices for Image Recognition","abstract":"Existing machine learning models demonstrate excellent performance in image object recognition after training on a large-scale dataset under full supervision. However, these models only learn to map an image to a predefined class index, without revealing the actual semantic meaning of the object in the image. In contrast, vision-language models like CLIP are able to assign semantic class names to unseen objects in a `zero-shot' manner, although they still rely on a predefined set of candidate names at test time. In this paper, we reconsider the recognition problem and task a vision-language model to assign class names to images given only a large and essentially unconstrained vocabulary of categories as prior information. We use non-parametric methods to establish relationships between images which allow the model to automatically narrow down the set of possible candidate names. Specifically, we propose iteratively clustering the data and voting on class names within them, showing that this enables a roughly 50\\% improvement over the baseline on ImageNet. Furthermore, we tackle this problem both in unsupervised and partially supervised settings, as well as with a coarse-grained and fine-grained search space as the unconstrained dictionary.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02364v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Segmentation of Planning Target Volume in CT Series for Total Marrow Irradiation Using U-Net","abstract":"Radiotherapy (RT) is a key component in the treatment of various cancers, including Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). Precise delineation of organs at risk (OARs) and target areas is essential for effective treatment planning. Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques, such as Total Marrow Irradiation (TMI) and Total Marrow and Lymph node Irradiation (TMLI), provide more precise radiation delivery compared to Total Body Irradiation (TBI). However, these techniques require time-consuming manual segmentation of structures in Computerized Tomography (CT) scans by the Radiation Oncologist (RO). In this paper, we present a deep learning-based auto-contouring method for segmenting Planning Target Volume (PTV) for TMLI treatment using the U-Net architecture. We trained and compared two segmentation models with two different loss functions on a dataset of 100 patients treated with TMLI at the Humanitas Research Hospital between 2011 and 2021. Despite challenges in lymph node areas, the best model achieved an average Dice score of 0.816 for PTV segmentation. Our findings are a preliminary but significant step towards developing a segmentation model that has the potential to save radiation oncologists a considerable amount of time. This could allow for the treatment of more patients, resulting in improved clinical practice efficiency and more reproducible contours.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02353v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Self-supervised 3D Human Pose Estimation from a Single Image","abstract":"We propose a new self-supervised method for predicting 3D human body pose from a single image. The prediction network is trained from a dataset of unlabelled images depicting people in typical poses and a set of unpaired 2D poses. By minimising the need for annotated data, the method has the potential for rapid application to pose estimation of other articulated structures (e.g. animals). The self-supervision comes from an earlier idea exploiting consistency between predicted pose under 3D rotation. Our method is a substantial advance on state-of-the-art self-supervised methods in training a mapping directly from images, without limb articulation constraints or any 3D empirical pose prior. We compare performance with state-of-the-art self-supervised methods using benchmark datasets that provide images and ground-truth 3D pose (Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP). Despite the reduced requirement for annotated data, we show that the method outperforms on Human3.6M and matches performance on MPI-INF-3DHP. Qualitative results on a dataset of human hands show the potential for rapidly learning to predict 3D pose for articulated structures other than the human body.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02349v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"Few-shot Semantic Image Synthesis with Class Affinity Transfer","abstract":"Semantic image synthesis aims to generate photo realistic images given a semantic segmentation map. Despite much recent progress, training them still requires large datasets of images annotated with per-pixel label maps that are extremely tedious to obtain. To alleviate the high annotation cost, we propose a transfer method that leverages a model trained on a large source dataset to improve the learning ability on small target datasets via estimated pairwise relations between source and target classes. The class affinity matrix is introduced as a first layer to the source model to make it compatible with the target label maps, and the source model is then further finetuned for the target domain. To estimate the class affinities we consider different approaches to leverage prior knowledge: semantic segmentation on the source domain, textual label embeddings, and self-supervised vision features. We apply our approach to GAN-based and diffusion-based architectures for semantic synthesis. Our experiments show that the different ways to estimate class affinity can be effectively combined, and that our approach significantly improves over existing state-of-the-art transfer approaches for generative image models.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02321v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Efficient CNNs via Passive Filter Pruning","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown state-of-the-art performance in various applications. However, CNNs are resource-hungry due to their requirement of high computational complexity and memory storage. Recent efforts toward achieving computational efficiency in CNNs involve filter pruning methods that eliminate some of the filters in CNNs based on the \\enquote{importance} of the filters. The majority of existing filter pruning methods are either \"active\", which use a dataset and generate feature maps to quantify filter importance, or \"passive\", which compute filter importance using entry-wise norm of the filters without involving data. Under a high pruning ratio where large number of filters are to be pruned from the network, the entry-wise norm methods eliminate relatively smaller norm filters without considering the significance of the filters in producing the node output, resulting in degradation in the performance. To address this, we present a passive filter pruning method where the filters are pruned based on their contribution in producing output by considering the operator norm of the filters. The proposed pruning method generalizes better across various CNNs compared to that of the entry-wise norm-based pruning methods. In comparison to the existing active filter pruning methods, the proposed pruning method is at least 4.5 times faster in computing filter importance and is able to achieve similar performance compared to that of the active filter pruning methods. The efficacy of the proposed pruning method is evaluated on audio scene classification and image classification using various CNNs architecture such as VGGish, DCASE21_Net, VGG-16 and ResNet-50.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02319v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

People with different personalities may respond differently to the same situation. However, such individual personalities were ignored in the previous studies. In this work, we introduce a new Personality-aware Human-centric Multimodal Reasoning (Personality-aware HMR) task, and accordingly construct a new dataset based on The Big Bang Theory television shows, to predict the behavior of a specific person at a specific moment, given the multimodal information of its past and future moments. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) was annotated and utilized in the task to represent individuals' personalities. We benchmark the task by proposing three baseline methods, two were adapted from the related tasks and one was newly proposed for our task. The experimental results demonstrate that personality can effectively improve the performance of human-centric multimodal reasoning. To further solve the lack of personality annotation in real-life scenes, we introduce an extended task called Personality-predicted HMR, and propose the corresponding methods, to predict the MBTI personality at first, and then use the predicted personality to help multimodal reasoning. The experimental results show that our method can accurately predict personality and achieves satisfactory multimodal reasoning performance without relying on personality annotations.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02313v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Milky Way globular clusters on cosmological timescales. II. Interaction with the Galactic centre","abstract":"Aims. We estimate the dynamical evolution of the Globular Clusters interaction with the Galactic centre that dynamically changed in the past.   Methods. We simulated the orbits of 147 globular clusters over 10 Gyr lookback time using the parallel N-body code phi-GPU. For each globular cluster, we generated 1000 sets of initial data with random proper motions and radial velocities based on the observed values. To distinguish globular clusters interacting with the galactic centre, we used the criterion of a relative distance of less than 100 pc. We used four external potentials from the IllustrisTNG-100 database, which were selected for their similarity to the present-day Milky Way, to simulate the structure of the Galaxy at different times.   Results. We obtained 3-4 globular cluster interactions per Gyr at distances of less than 50 pc and 5-6 interactions per Gyr at distances of less than 80 pc among the studied 147 globular clusters that had close passages near the Galactic centre. We selected 10 of them for detailed study and found almost 100% probability of interaction with the Galactic centre for six of them.   Conclusions. According to our results, the maximum interaction frequency of globular clusters with the Galactic centre in the Milky Way is likely to be a few dozens of passages per Gyr within a central zone of 100 pc. This low frequency may not be sufficient to fully explain the relatively high mass (of order 10^7 Msol) of the nuclear star cluster in the Milky Way, if we consider only the periodic capture of stars from globular clusters during close encounters. Therefore, we must also consider the possibility that some early globular clusters were completely tidally disrupted during interactions with the forming nuclear star cluster and the Galactic centre.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02311v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

We present extensive atomic data for O I, by using the multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and relativistic configuration interaction methods. Lifetimes and transition probabilities for radiative electric dipole transitions are given and compared with results from previous calculations and available measurements. The accuracy of the computed transition rates is evaluated by the differences between the transition rates in Babushkin and Coulomb gauges, as well as by a cancellation factor analysis. Out of the 989 computed transitions in this work, 205 are assigned to the accuracy classes AA-B, that is, with uncertainties less than 10%, following the criteria defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology Atomic Spectra Database.

However, current machine learning algorithms struggle with out-of-domain transfer in facial expression recognition (FER). We propose a biologically-inspired mechanism for such transfer learning, which is based on norm-referenced encoding, where patterns are encoded in terms of difference vectors relative to a domain-specific reference vector. By incorporating domain-specific reference frames, we demonstrate high data efficiency in transfer learning across multiple domains. Our proposed architecture provides an explanation for how the human brain might innately recognize facial expressions on varying head shapes (humans, monkeys, and cartoon avatars) without extensive training. Norm-referenced encoding also allows the intensity of the expression to be read out directly from neural unit activity, similar to face-selective neurons in the brain. Our model achieves a classification accuracy of 92.15\\% on the FERG dataset with extreme data efficiency. We train our proposed mechanism with only 12 images, including a single image of each class (facial expression) and one image per domain (avatar).

The CrowdAI Mapping Challenge Dataset is one of these datasets that has been used extensively in recent years to train deep neural networks. This dataset consists of $ \\sim\\ $280k training images and $ \\sim\\ $60k testing images, with polygonal building annotations for all images. However, issues such as low-quality and incorrect annotations, extensive duplication of image samples, and data leakage significantly reduce the utility of deep neural networks trained on the dataset.

In this line of research, a few invariant learning algorithms for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization have been proposed by using multiple training environments to find invariant relationships. Some of them are focused on causal discovery as Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP), which finds causal parents of a variable of interest, and some directly provide a causal optimal predictor that generalizes well in OOD environments as Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM). This group of algorithms works under the assumption of multiple environments that represent different interventions in the causal inference context. Those environments are not normally available when working with observational data and real-world applications. Here we propose a method to generate them in an efficient way. We assess the performance of this unsupervised learning problem by implementing ICP on simulated data. We also show how to apply ICP efficiently integrated with our method for causal discovery.

Proposed multi-modes include ConvLSTM-based feature domain prediction, optical flow conditioned feature domain prediction, and feature propagation to address a wide range of cases from static scenes without apparent motions to dynamic scenes with a moving camera. We partition the feature space into blocks for temporal prediction in spatial block-based representations. For entropy coding, we consider both dense and sparse post-quantization residual blocks, and apply optional run-length coding to sparse residuals to improve the compression rate. In this sense, our method uses a dual-mode entropy coding scheme guided by a binary density map, which offers significant rate reduction surpassing the extra cost of transmitting the binary selection map.

In this regard, two different distribution strategies (i.e., the RANDOM strategy and the COPY strategy) are investigated. The second challenge is how to select an appropriate type of objective function so that the best asymptotic efficiency can be achieved. Then, the under-sampled (US) and inverse probability weighted (IPW) types of objective functions are considered.

{"title":"Deep Perceptual Similarity is Adaptable to Ambiguous Contexts","abstract":"The concept of image similarity is ambiguous, meaning that images that are considered similar in one context might not be in another. This ambiguity motivates the creation of metrics for specific contexts. This work explores the ability of the successful deep perceptual similarity (DPS) metrics to adapt to a given context. Recently, DPS metrics have emerged using the deep features of neural networks for comparing images. These metrics have been successful on datasets that leverage the average human perception in limited settings. But the question remains if they could be adapted to specific contexts of similarity. No single metric can suit all definitions of similarity and previous metrics have been rule-based which are labor intensive to rewrite for new contexts. DPS metrics, on the other hand, use neural networks which might be retrained for each context. However, retraining networks takes resources and might ruin performance on previous tasks. This work examines the adaptability of DPS metrics by training positive scalars for the deep features of pretrained CNNs to correctly measure similarity for different contexts. Evaluation is performed on contexts defined by randomly ordering six image distortions (e.g. rotation) by which should be considered more similar when applied to an image. This also gives insight into whether the features in the CNN is enough to discern different distortions without retraining. Finally, the trained metrics are evaluated on a perceptual similarity dataset to evaluate if adapting to an ordering affects their performance on established scenarios. The findings show that DPS metrics can be adapted with high performance. While the adapted metrics have difficulties with the same contexts as baselines, performance is improved in 99% of cases. Finally, it is shown that the adaption is not significantly detrimental to prior performance on perceptual similarity.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02265v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Persuading to Prepare for Quitting Smoking with a Virtual Coach: Using States and User Characteristics to Predict Behavior","abstract":"Despite their prevalence in eHealth applications for behavior change, persuasive messages tend to have small effects on behavior. Conditions or states (e.g., confidence, knowledge, motivation) and characteristics (e.g., gender, age, personality) of persuadees are two promising components for more effective algorithms for choosing persuasive messages. However, it is not yet sufficiently clear how well considering these components allows one to predict behavior after persuasive attempts, especially in the long run. Since collecting data for many algorithm components is costly and places a burden on users, a better understanding of the impact of individual components in practice is welcome. This can help to make an informed decision on which components to use. We thus conducted a longitudinal study in which a virtual coach persuaded 671 daily smokers to do preparatory activities for quitting smoking and becoming more physically active, such as envisioning one's desired future self. Based on the collected data, we designed a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-approach that considers current and future states to maximize the effort people spend on their activities. Using this RL-approach, we found, based on leave-one-out cross-validation, that considering states helps to predict both behavior and future states. User characteristics and especially involvement in the activities, on the other hand, only help to predict behavior if used in combination with states rather than alone. We see these results as supporting the use of states and involvement in persuasion algorithms.

{"title":"Low Latency Computing for Time Stretch Instruments","abstract":"Time stretch instruments have been exceptionally successful in discovering single-shot ultrafast phenomena such as optical rogue waves and have led to record-speed microscopy, spectroscopy, lidar, etc. These instruments encode the ultrafast events into the spectrum of a femtosecond pulse and then dilate the time scale of the data using group velocity dispersion. Generating as much as Tbit per second of data, they are ideal partners for deep learning networks which by their inherent complexity, require large datasets for training. However, the inference time scale of neural networks in the millisecond regime is orders of magnitude longer than the data acquisition rate of time stretch instruments. This underscores the need to explore means where some of the lower-level computational tasks can be done while the data is still in the optical domain. The Nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger Kernel computing addresses this predicament. It utilizes optical nonlinearities to map the data onto a new domain in which classification accuracy is enhanced, without increasing the data dimensions. One limitation of this technique is the fixed optical transfer function, which prevents training and generalizability. Here we show that the optical kernel can be effectively tuned and trained by utilizing digital phase encoding of the femtosecond laser pulse leading to a reduction of the error rate in data classification.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02249v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

The diversity of the datasets is the foundation for developing comprehensive IAD algorithms. Existing IAD datasets focus on the diversity of data categories, overlooking the diversity of domains within the same data category. In this paper, to bridge this gap, we propose the Aero-engine Blade Anomaly Detection (AeBAD) dataset, consisting of two sub-datasets: the single-blade dataset and the video anomaly detection dataset of blades. Compared to existing datasets, AeBAD has the following two characteristics: 1.) The target samples are not aligned and at different scales. 2.) There is a domain shift between the distribution of normal samples in the test set and the training set, where the domain shifts are mainly caused by the changes in illumination and view. Based on this dataset, we observe that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) IAD methods exhibit limitations when the domain of normal samples in the test set undergoes a shift.

Although dramatic progress has been made in sketch retrieval, few efforts are devoted to logo sketch retrieval which is still hindered by the following challenges: Firstly, logo sketch retrieval is more difficult than typical sketch retrieval problem, since a logo sketch usually contains much less visual contents with only irregular strokes and lines. Secondly, instance-specific sketches demonstrate dramatic appearance variances, making them less identifiable when querying the same logo instance. Thirdly, there exist several sketch retrieval benchmarking datasets nowadays, whereas an instance-level logo sketch dataset is still publicly unavailable. To address the above-mentioned limitations, we make twofold contributions in this study for instance-level logo sketch retrieval. To begin with, we construct an instance-level logo sketch dataset containing 2k logo instances and exceeding 9k sketches. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available instance-level logo sketch dataset. Next, we develop a fine-grained triple-branch CNN architecture based on hybrid attention mechanism termed LogoNet for accurate logo sketch retrieval. More specifically, we embed the hybrid attention mechanism into the triple-branch architecture for capturing the key query-specific information from the limited visual cues in the logo sketches. Experimental evaluations both on our assembled dataset and public benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed network.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02214v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

We accomplished this task by tuning GPT-3 on an existed perovskite solar cell FAIR(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) dataset with 91.8 F1-score and we updated the dataset with all related scientific papers up to now. The produced dataset is formatted and normalized, enabling its direct utilization as input in subsequent data analysis. This feature will enable materials scientists to develop their own models by selecting high-quality review papers within their domain. Furthermore, we designed experiments to predict solar cells' electrical performance and reverse-predict parameters on both material gene and FAIR datesets through LLM. We obtained comparable performance with traditional machine learning methods without feature selection, which demonstrates the potential of large language models to judge materials and design new materials like a materials scientist.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02213v2","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"PIKS: A Technique to Identify Actionable Trends for Policy-Makers Through Open Healthcare Data","abstract":"With calls for increasing transparency, governments are releasing greater amounts of data in multiple domains including finance, education and healthcare. The efficient exploratory analysis of healthcare data constitutes a significant challenge. Key concerns in public health include the quick identification and analysis of trends, and the detection of outliers. This allows policies to be rapidly adapted to changing circumstances. We present an efficient outlier detection technique, termed PIKS (Pruned iterative-k means searchlight), which combines an iterative k-means algorithm with a pruned searchlight based scan. We apply this technique to identify outliers in two publicly available healthcare datasets from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System, and California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. We provide a comparison of our technique with three other existing outlier detection techniques, consisting of auto-encoders, isolation forests and feature bagging. We identified outliers in conditions including suicide rates, immunity disorders, social admissions, cardiomyopathies, and pregnancy in the third trimester. We demonstrate that the PIKS technique produces results consistent with other techniques such as the auto-encoder. However, the auto-encoder needs to be trained, which requires several parameters to be tuned. In comparison, the PIKS technique has far fewer parameters to tune. This makes it advantageous for fast, \"out-of-the-box\" data exploration. The PIKS technique is scalable and can readily ingest new datasets. Hence, it can provide valuable, up-to-date insights to citizens, patients and policy-makers. We have made our code open source, and with the availability of open data, other researchers can easily reproduce and extend our work. This will help promote a deeper understanding of healthcare policies and public health issues.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02208v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

Although the recent attempts from knowledge tracing and cognitive diagnosis propose several promising directions for improving the usability and effectiveness of current models, the existing public datasets are still insufficient to meet the need for these potential solutions due to their ignorance of complete exercising contexts, fine-grained concepts, and cognitive labels. In this paper, we present MoocRadar, a fine-grained, multi-aspect knowledge repository consisting of 2,513 exercise questions, 5,600 knowledge concepts, and over 12 million behavioral records. Specifically, we propose a framework to guarantee a high-quality and comprehensive annotation of fine-grained concepts and cognitive labels.

{"title":"Knowledge Combination to Learn Rotated Detection Without Rotated Annotation","abstract":"Rotated bounding boxes drastically reduce output ambiguity of elongated objects, making it superior to axis-aligned bounding boxes. Despite the effectiveness, rotated detectors are not widely employed. Annotating rotated bounding boxes is such a laborious process that they are not provided in many detection datasets where axis-aligned annotations are used instead. In this paper, we propose a framework that allows the model to predict precise rotated boxes only requiring cheaper axis-aligned annotation of the target dataset 1. To achieve this, we leverage the fact that neural networks are capable of learning richer representation of the target domain than what is utilized by the task. The under-utilized representation can be exploited to address a more detailed task. Our framework combines task knowledge of an out-of-domain source dataset with stronger annotation and domain knowledge of the target dataset with weaker annotation. A novel assignment process and projection loss are used to enable the co-training on the source and target datasets. As a result, the model is able to solve the more detailed task in the target domain, without additional computation overhead during inference. We extensively evaluate the method on various target datasets including fresh-produce dataset, HRSC2016 and SSDD. Results show that the proposed method consistently performs on par with the fully supervised approach.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02199v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"A Diffusion-based Method for Multi-turn Compositional Image Generation","abstract":"Multi-turn compositional image generation (M-CIG) is a challenging task that aims to iteratively manipulate a reference image given a modification text. While most of the existing methods for M-CIG are based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), recent advances in image generation have demonstrated the superiority of diffusion models over GANs. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based method for M-CIG named conditional denoising diffusion with image compositional matching (CDD-ICM). We leverage CLIP as the backbone of image and text encoders, and incorporate a gated fusion mechanism, originally proposed for question answering, to compositionally fuse the reference image and the modification text at each turn of M-CIG. We introduce a conditioning scheme to generate the target image based on the fusion results. To prioritize the semantic quality of the generated target image, we learn an auxiliary image compositional match (ICM) objective, along with the conditional denoising diffusion (CDD) objective in a multi-task learning framework. Additionally, we also perform ICM guidance and classifier-free guidance to improve performance. Experimental results show that CDD-ICM achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets for M-CIG, i.e., CoDraw and i-CLEVR.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02192v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"A system for exploring big data: an iterative k-means searchlight for outlier detection on open health data","abstract":"The interactive exploration of large and evolving datasets is challenging as relationships between underlying variables may not be fully understood. There may be hidden trends and patterns in the data that are worthy of further exploration and analysis. We present a system that methodically explores multiple combinations of variables using a searchlight technique and identifies outliers. An iterative k-means clustering algorithm is applied to features derived through a split-apply-combine paradigm used in the database literature. Outliers are identified as singleton or small clusters. This algorithm is swept across the dataset in a searchlight manner. The dimensions that contain outliers are combined in pairs with other dimensions using a susbset scan technique to gain further insight into the outliers. We illustrate this system by anaylzing open health care data released by New York State. We apply our iterative k-means searchlight followed by subset scanning. Several anomalous trends in the data are identified, including cost overruns at specific hospitals, and increases in diagnoses such as suicides. These constitute novel findings in the literature, and are of potential use to regulatory agencies, policy makers and concerned citizens.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02189v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"On the Impact of Voice Anonymization on Speech-Based COVID-19 Detection","abstract":"With advances seen in deep learning, voice-based applications are burgeoning, ranging from personal assistants, affective computing, to remote disease diagnostics. As the voice contains both linguistic and paralinguistic information (e.g., vocal pitch, intonation, speech rate, loudness), there is growing interest in voice anonymization to preserve speaker privacy and identity. Voice privacy challenges have emerged over the last few years and focus has been placed on removing speaker identity while keeping linguistic content intact. For affective computing and disease monitoring applications, however, the paralinguistic content may be more critical. Unfortunately, the effects that anonymization may have on these systems are still largely unknown. In this paper, we fill this gap and focus on one particular health monitoring application: speech-based COVID-19 diagnosis. We test two popular anonymization methods and their impact on five different state-of-the-art COVID-19 diagnostic systems using three public datasets. We validate the effectiveness of the anonymization methods, compare their computational complexity, and quantify the impact across different testing scenarios for both within- and across-dataset conditions. Lastly, we show the benefits of anonymization as a data augmentation tool to help recover some of the COVID-19 diagnostic accuracy loss seen with anonymized data.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02181v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

Existing chart comprehension methods suffer from either heuristic rules or an over-reliance on OCR systems, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we present ChartReader, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates chart derendering and comprehension tasks. Our approach includes a transformer-based chart component detection module and an extended pre-trained vision-language model for chart-to-X tasks. By learning the rules of charts automatically from annotated datasets, our approach eliminates the need for manual rule-making, reducing effort and enhancing accuracy.~We also introduce a data variable replacement technique and extend the input and position embeddings of the pre-trained model for cross-task training. We evaluate ChartReader on Chart-to-Table, ChartQA, and Chart-to-Text tasks, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our proposed framework can significantly reduce the manual effort involved in chart analysis, providing a step towards a universal chart understanding model. Moreover, our approach offers opportunities for plug-and-play integration with mainstream LLMs such as T5 and TaPas, extending their capability to chart comprehension tasks.

{"title":"GINA-3D: Learning to Generate Implicit Neural Assets in the Wild","abstract":"Modeling the 3D world from sensor data for simulation is a scalable way of developing testing and validation environments for robotic learning problems such as autonomous driving. However, manually creating or re-creating real-world-like environments is difficult, expensive, and not scalable. Recent generative model techniques have shown promising progress to address such challenges by learning 3D assets using only plentiful 2D images -- but still suffer limitations as they leverage either human-curated image datasets or renderings from manually-created synthetic 3D environments. In this paper, we introduce GINA-3D, a generative model that uses real-world driving data from camera and LiDAR sensors to create realistic 3D implicit neural assets of diverse vehicles and pedestrians. Compared to the existing image datasets, the real-world driving setting poses new challenges due to occlusions, lighting-variations and long-tail distributions. GINA-3D tackles these challenges by decoupling representation learning and generative modeling into two stages with a learned tri-plane latent structure, inspired by recent advances in generative modeling of images. To evaluate our approach, we construct a large-scale object-centric dataset containing over 520K images of vehicles and pedestrians from the Waymo Open Dataset, and a new set of 80K images of long-tail instances such as construction equipment, garbage trucks, and cable cars. We compare our model with existing approaches and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in quality and diversity for both generated images and geometries.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02163v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Pac-HuBERT: Self-Supervised Music Source Separation via Primitive Auditory Clustering and Hidden-Unit BERT","abstract":"In spite of the progress in music source separation research, the small amount of publicly-available clean source data remains a constant limiting factor for performance. Thus, recent advances in self-supervised learning present a largely-unexplored opportunity for improving separation models by leveraging unlabelled music data. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for music source separation inspired by the HuBERT speech representation model. We first investigate the potential impact of the original HuBERT model by inserting an adapted version of it into the well-known Demucs V2 time-domain separation model architecture. We then propose a time-frequency-domain self-supervised model, Pac-HuBERT (for primitive auditory clustering HuBERT), that we later use in combination with a Res-U-Net decoder for source separation. Pac-HuBERT uses primitive auditory features of music as unsupervised clustering labels to initialize the self-supervised pretraining process using the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset. The resulting framework achieves better source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) performance on the MusDB18 test set than the original Demucs V2 and Res-U-Net models. We further demonstrate that it can boost performance with small amounts of supervised data. Ultimately, our proposed framework is an effective solution to the challenge of limited clean source data for music source separation.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02160v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

We combine these steps with a test-time optimization method to form a state-of-the-art system that does not require any training data. Because our final approach is dataless, it can be applied on different datasets with diverse LiDAR rigs without retraining.

Hence, it enables the forward simulation of the rolled-out state-space model. While this approach has shown to provide high-accuracy and consistent model estimation, its convergence can be significantly improved by efficient initialization of the training process. This paper focuses on such an initialisation of the subspace encoder approach using the Best Linear Approximation (BLA).

{"title":"Statistics of extreme events in coarse-scale climate simulations via machine learning correction operators trained on nudged datasets","abstract":"This work presents a systematic framework for improving the predictions of statistical quantities for turbulent systems, with a focus on correcting climate simulations obtained by coarse-scale models. While high resolution simulations or reanalysis data are available, they cannot be directly used as training datasets to machine learn a correction for the coarse-scale climate model outputs, since chaotic divergence, inherent in the climate dynamics, makes datasets from different resolutions incompatible. To overcome this fundamental limitation we employ coarse-resolution model simulations nudged towards high quality climate realizations, here in the form of ERA5 reanalysis data. The nudging term is sufficiently small to not pollute the coarse-scale dynamics over short time scales, but also sufficiently large to keep the coarse-scale simulations close to the ERA5 trajectory over larger time scales. The result is a compatible pair of the ERA5 trajectory and the weakly nudged coarse-resolution E3SM output that is used as input training data to machine learn a correction operator. Once training is complete, we perform free-running coarse-scale E3SM simulations without nudging and use those as input to the machine-learned correction operator to obtain high-quality (corrected) outputs. The model is applied to atmospheric climate data with the purpose of predicting global and local statistics of various quantities of a time-period of a decade. Using datasets that are not employed for training, we demonstrate that the produced datasets from the ML-corrected coarse E3SM model have statistical properties that closely resemble the observations. Furthermore, the corrected coarse-scale E3SM output for the frequency of occurrence of extreme events, such as tropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers are presented.

This is the case with panoptic segmentation, where the structure of the problem and architectures designed to solve it means that unlike image classification or even semantic segmentation, the typical solution of using a mean across samples cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we demonstrate how ensemble-based uncertainty estimation approaches such as Monte Carlo Dropout can be used in the panoptic segmentation domain with no changes to an existing network, providing both improved performance and more importantly a better measure of uncertainty for predictions made by the network.

EduceLab-Scrolls contains a set of volumetric X-ray CT images of both small fragments and intact, rolled scrolls. The dataset also contains 2D image labels that are used in the supervised training of an ink detection model. Labeling is enabled by aligning spectral photography of scroll fragments with X-ray CT images of the same fragments, thus creating a machine-learnable mapping between image spaces and modalities. This alignment permits supervised learning for the detection of \"invisible\" carbon ink in X-ray CT, a task that is \"impossible\" even for human expert labelers. To our knowledge, this is the first aligned dataset of its kind and is the largest dataset ever released in the heritage domain. Our method is capable of revealing accurate lines of text on scroll fragments with known ground truth. Revealed text is verified using visual confirmation, quantitative image metrics, and scholarly review.

However, existing large-scale video-text datasets and mining techniques suffer from several limitations, such as the scarcity of aligned data, the lack of diversity in the data, and the difficulty of collecting aligned data. Currently popular video-text data mining approach via automatic speech recognition (ASR) used in HowTo100M provides low-quality captions that often do not refer to the video content. Other mining approaches do not provide proper language descriptions (video tags) and are biased toward short clips (alt text). In this work, we show how recent advances in image captioning allow us to pre-train high-quality video models without any parallel video-text data. We pre-train several video captioning models that are based on an OPT language model and a TimeSformer visual backbone. We fine-tune these networks on several video captioning datasets. First, we demonstrate that image captioning pseudolabels work better for pre-training than the existing HowTo100M ASR captions. Second, we show that pre-training on both images and videos produces a significantly better network (+4 CIDER on MSR-VTT) than pre-training on a single modality. Our methods are complementary to the existing pre-training or data mining approaches and can be used in a variety of settings.

We tackle this problem by proposing a new architecture based on latent diffusion models, an approach that has not been used before in the fashion domain. Given the lack of existing datasets suitable for the task, we also extend two existing fashion datasets, namely Dress Code and VITON-HD, with multimodal annotations collected in a semi-automatic manner. Experimental results on these new datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal, both in terms of realism and coherence with the given multimodal inputs. Source code and collected multimodal annotations will be publicly released at: https://github.com/aimagelab/multimodal-garment-designer.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02051v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Multi-Class Explainable Unlearning for Image Classification via Weight Filtering","abstract":"Machine Unlearning has recently been emerging as a paradigm for selectively removing the impact of training datapoints from a network. While existing approaches have focused on unlearning either a small subset of the training data or a single class, in this paper we take a different path and devise a framework that can unlearn all classes of an image classification network in a single untraining round. Our proposed technique learns to modulate the inner components of an image classification network through memory matrices so that, after training, the same network can selectively exhibit an unlearning behavior over any of the classes. By discovering weights which are specific to each of the classes, our approach also recovers a representation of the classes which is explainable by-design. We test the proposed framework, which we name Weight Filtering network (WF-Net), on small-scale and medium-scale image classification datasets, with both CNN and Transformer-based backbones. Our work provides interesting insights in the development of explainable solutions for unlearning and could be easily extended to other vision tasks.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02049v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Multi-Level Contrastive Learning for Dense Prediction Task","abstract":"In this work, we present Multi-Level Contrastive Learning for Dense Prediction Task (MCL), an efficient self-supervised method for learning region-level feature representation for dense prediction tasks. Our method is motivated by the three key factors in detection: localization, scale consistency and recognition. To explicitly encode absolute position and scale information, we propose a novel pretext task that assembles multi-scale images in a montage manner to mimic multi-object scenarios. Unlike the existing image-level self-supervised methods, our method constructs a multi-level contrastive loss that considers each sub-region of the montage image as a singleton. Our method enables the neural network to learn regional semantic representations for translation and scale consistency while reducing pre-training epochs to the same as supervised pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCL consistently outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on various datasets with significant margins. In particular, MCL obtains 42.5 AP$^\\mathrm{bb}$ and 38.3 AP$^\\mathrm{mk}$ on COCO with the 1x schedule fintuning, when using Mask R-CNN with R50-FPN backbone pre-trained with 100 epochs. In comparison to MoCo, our method surpasses their performance by 4.0 AP$^\\mathrm{bb}$ and 3.1 AP$^\\mathrm{mk}$. Furthermore, we explore the alignment between pretext task and downstream tasks. We extend our pretext task to supervised pre-training, which achieves a similar performance to self-supervised learning. This result demonstrates the importance of the alignment between pretext task and downstream tasks, indicating the potential for wider applicability of our method beyond self-supervised settings.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02010v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"OrienterNet: Visual Localization in 2D Public Maps with Neural Matching","abstract":"Humans can orient themselves in their 3D environments using simple 2D maps. Differently, algorithms for visual localization mostly rely on complex 3D point clouds that are expensive to build, store, and maintain over time. We bridge this gap by introducing OrienterNet, the first deep neural network that can localize an image with sub-meter accuracy using the same 2D semantic maps that humans use. OrienterNet estimates the location and orientation of a query image by matching a neural Bird's-Eye View with open and globally available maps from OpenStreetMap, enabling anyone to localize anywhere such maps are available. OrienterNet is supervised only by camera poses but learns to perform semantic matching with a wide range of map elements in an end-to-end manner. To enable this, we introduce a large crowd-sourced dataset of images captured across 12 cities from the diverse viewpoints of cars, bikes, and pedestrians. OrienterNet generalizes to new datasets and pushes the state of the art in both robotics and AR scenarios. The code and trained model will be released publicly.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02009v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"GlueStick: Robust Image Matching by Sticking Points and Lines Together","abstract":"Line segments are powerful features complementary to points. They offer structural cues, robust to drastic viewpoint and illumination changes, and can be present even in texture-less areas. However, describing and matching them is more challenging compared to points due to partial occlusions, lack of texture, or repetitiveness. This paper introduces a new matching paradigm, where points, lines, and their descriptors are unified into a single wireframe structure. We propose GlueStick, a deep matching Graph Neural Network (GNN) that takes two wireframes from different images and leverages the connectivity information between nodes to better glue them together. In addition to the increased efficiency brought by the joint matching, we also demonstrate a large boost of performance when leveraging the complementary nature of these two features in a single architecture. We show that our matching strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches independently matching line segments and points for a wide variety of datasets and tasks.

We use eigenvector continuation for fast and accurate emulation of the likelihood and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to draw effectively independent samples from the posteriors. Our Bayesian inference is conditioned on the Granada database of neutron-proton ($np$) cross sections and polarizations. We use priors grounded in $\\chi$EFT assumptions and a Roy-Steiner analysis of pion-nucleon scattering data. We model correlated EFT truncation errors using a two-feature Gaussian process, and find correlation lengths for $np$ scattering energies and angles in the ranges 40--120 MeV and 25--45 degrees, respectively. These correlations yield a non-diagonal covariance matrix and reduce the number of independent scattering data with a factor of eight and four at the second and third chiral orders, respectively. The relatively small difference between the second and third order predictions in delta-full $\\chi$EFT suppresses the marginal variance of the truncation error and the effects of its correlation structure.

{"title":"Revisiting the Evaluation of Image Synthesis with GANs","abstract":"A good metric, which promises a reliable comparison between solutions, is essential to a well-defined task. Unlike most vision tasks that have per-sample ground-truth, image synthesis targets generating \\emph{unseen} data and hence is usually evaluated with a distributional distance between one set of real samples and another set of generated samples. This work provides an empirical study on the evaluation of synthesis performance by taking the popular generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a representative of generative models. In particular, we make in-depth analyses on how to represent a data point in the feature space, how to calculate a fair distance using selected samples, and how many instances to use from each set. Experiments on multiple datasets and settings suggest that (1) a group of models including both CNN-based and ViT-based architectures serve as reliable and robust feature extractors, (2) Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) enables better comparison across various extractors and hierarchical layers in one model, and (3) CKA shows satisfactory sample efficiency and complements existing metrics (\\textit{e.g.}, FID) in characterizing the similarity between two internal data correlations. These findings help us design a new measurement system, based on which we re-evaluate the state-of-the-art generative models in a consistent and reliable way.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01999v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

It leverages the strengths of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT). By enabling DDPMs to operate in the DWT domain, our DDPM models effectively hallucinate high-frequency information for super-resolved images on the wavelet spectrum, resulting in high-quality and detailed reconstructions in image space. Quantitatively, we outperform state-of-the-art diffusion-based SISR methods, namely SR3 and SRDiff, regarding PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS on both face (8x scaling) and general (4x scaling) SR benchmarks. Meanwhile, using DWT enabled us to use fewer parameters than the compared models: 92M parameters instead of 550M compared to SR3 and 9.3M instead of 12M compared to SRDiff. Additionally, our method outperforms other state-of-the-art generative methods on classical general SR datasets while saving inference time.

In recent years, numerous public datasets have played significant roles in the advancement of autonomous cars and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, these two platforms differ from aerial work robots: UAVs are limited in their payload capacity, while cars are restricted to two-dimensional movements. To fill this gap, we create the Giraffe mapping robot based on a bucket truck, which is equipped with a variety of well-calibrated and synchronized sensors: four 3D LiDARs, two stereo cameras, two monocular cameras, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), and a GNSS/INS system. A laser tracker is used to record the millimeter-level ground truth positions. We also make its ground twin, the Okapi mapping robot, to gather data for comparison. The proposed dataset extends the typical autonomous driving sensing suite to aerial scenes. Therefore, the dataset is named FLICAR to denote flying cars. We believe this dataset can also represent the flying car scenarios, specifically the takeoff and landing of VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) flying cars.

While several multi-source DG methods have been proposed, they incur additional complexity during training by using domain labels. Recent work has shown that a well-tuned Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) training procedure, that is simply minimizing the empirical risk on the source domains, can outperform most existing DG methods. We identify several key candidate techniques to further improve ERM performance, such as better utilization of training data, model parameter selection, and weight-space regularization. We call the resulting method ERM++, and show it significantly improves the performance of DG on five multi-source datasets by over 5% compared to standard ERM, and beats state-of-the-art despite being less computationally expensive.

{"title":"MEGClass: Text Classification with Extremely Weak Supervision via Mutually-Enhancing Text Granularities","abstract":"Text classification typically requires a substantial amount of human-annotated data to serve as supervision, which is costly to obtain in dynamic emerging domains. Certain methods seek to address this problem by solely relying on the surface text of class names to serve as extremely weak supervision. However, existing methods fail to account for single-class documents discussing multiple topics. Both topic diversity and vague sentences may introduce noise into the document's underlying representation and consequently the precision of the predicted class. Furthermore, current work focuses on text granularities (documents, sentences, or words) independently, which limits the degree of coarse- or fine-grained context that we can jointly extract from all three to identify significant subtext for classification. In order to address this problem, we propose MEGClass, an extremely weakly-supervised text classification method to exploit Mutually-Enhancing Text Granularities. Specifically, MEGClass constructs class-oriented sentence and class representations based on keywords for performing a sentence-level confidence-weighted label ensemble in order to estimate a document's initial class distribution. This serves as the target distribution for a multi-head attention network with a class-weighted contrastive loss. This network learns contextualized sentence representations and weights to form document representations that reflect its original document and sentence-level topic diversity. Retaining this heterogeneity allows MEGClass to select the most class-indicative documents to serve as iterative feedback for enhancing the class representations. Finally, these top documents are used to fine-tune a pre-trained text classifier. As demonstrated through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, MEGClass outperforms other weakly and extremely weakly supervised methods.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01969v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"LLM-Adapters: An Adapter Family for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models","abstract":"The success of large language models (LLMs), like GPT-3 and ChatGPT, has led to the development of numerous cost-effective and accessible alternatives that are created by fine-tuning open-access LLMs with task-specific data (e.g., ChatDoctor) or instruction data (e.g., Alpaca). Among the various fine-tuning methods, adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is undoubtedly one of the most attractive topics, as it only requires fine-tuning a few external parameters instead of the entire LLMs while achieving comparable or even better performance. To enable further research on PEFT methods of LLMs, this paper presents LLM-Adapters, an easy-to-use framework that integrates various adapters into LLMs and can execute these adapter-based PEFT methods of LLMs for different tasks. The framework includes state-of-the-art open-access LLMs such as LLaMA, BLOOM, OPT, and GPT-J, as well as widely used adapters such as Series adapter, Parallel adapter, and LoRA. The framework is designed to be research-friendly, efficient, modular, and extendable, allowing the integration of new adapters and the evaluation of them with new and larger-scale LLMs. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of adapters in LLMs-Adapters, we conduct experiments on six math reasoning datasets. The results demonstrate that using adapter-based PEFT in smaller-scale LLMs (7B) with few extra trainable parameters yields comparable, and in some cases superior, performance to that of powerful LLMs (175B) in zero-shot inference on simple math reasoning datasets. Overall, we provide a promising framework for fine-tuning large LLMs on downstream tasks. We believe the proposed LLMs-Adapters will advance adapter-based PEFT research, facilitate the deployment of research pipelines, and enable practical applications to real-world systems.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01933v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"High-Throughput Vector Similarity Search in Knowledge Graphs","abstract":"There is an increasing adoption of machine learning for encoding data into vectors to serve online recommendation and search use cases. As a result, recent data management systems propose augmenting query processing with online vector similarity search. In this work, we explore vector similarity search in the context of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Motivated by the tasks of finding related KG queries and entities for past KG query workloads, we focus on hybrid vector similarity search (hybrid queries for short) where part of the query corresponds to vector similarity search and part of the query corresponds to predicates over relational attributes associated with the underlying data vectors. For example, given past KG queries for a song entity, we want to construct new queries for new song entities whose vector representations are close to the vector representation of the entity in the past KG query. But entities in a KG also have non-vector attributes such as a song associated with an artist, a genre, and a release date. Therefore, suggested entities must also satisfy query predicates over non-vector attributes beyond a vector-based similarity predicate. While these tasks are central to KGs, our contributions are generally applicable to hybrid queries. In contrast to prior works that optimize online queries, we focus on enabling efficient batch processing of past hybrid query workloads. We present our system, HQI, for high-throughput batch processing of hybrid queries. We introduce a workload-aware vector data partitioning scheme to tailor the vector index layout to the given workload and describe a multi-query optimization technique to reduce the overhead of vector similarity computations. We evaluate our methods on industrial workloads and demonstrate that HQI yields a 31x improvement in throughput for finding related KG queries compared to existing hybrid query processing approaches.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01926v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"Strong Baselines for Parameter Efficient Few-Shot Fine-tuning","abstract":"Few-shot classification (FSC) entails learning novel classes given only a few examples per class after a pre-training (or meta-training) phase on a set of base classes. Recent works have shown that simply fine-tuning a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) on new test classes is a strong approach for FSC. Fine-tuning ViTs, however, is expensive in time, compute and storage. This has motivated the design of parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods which fine-tune only a fraction of the Transformer's parameters. While these methods have shown promise, inconsistencies in experimental conditions make it difficult to disentangle their advantage from other experimental factors including the feature extractor architecture, pre-trained initialization and fine-tuning algorithm, amongst others. In our paper, we conduct a large-scale, experimentally consistent, empirical analysis to study PEFTs for few-shot image classification. Through a battery of over 1.8k controlled experiments on large-scale few-shot benchmarks including Meta-Dataset (MD) and ORBIT, we uncover novel insights on PEFTs that cast light on their efficacy in fine-tuning ViTs for few-shot classification. Through our controlled empirical study, we have two main findings: (i) Fine-tuning just the LayerNorm parameters (which we call LN-Tune) during few-shot adaptation is an extremely strong baseline across ViTs pre-trained with both self-supervised and supervised objectives, (ii) For self-supervised ViTs, we find that simply learning a set of scaling parameters for each attention matrix (which we call AttnScale) along with a domain-residual adapter (DRA) module leads to state-of-the-art performance (while being $\\sim\\!$ 9$\\times$ more parameter-efficient) on MD.

With more than 176,000 3D poses from 24 different subjects performing 5 different sports activities, SportsPose provides a diverse and comprehensive set of 3D poses that reflect the complex and dynamic nature of sports movements. Contrary to other markerless datasets we have quantitatively evaluated the precision of SportsPose by comparing our poses with a commercial marker-based system and achieve a mean error of 34.5 mm across all evaluation sequences. This is comparable to the error reported on the commonly used 3DPW dataset. We further introduce a new metric, local movement, which describes the movement of the wrist and ankle joints in relation to the body. With this, we show that SportsPose contains more movement than the Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets in these extremum joints, indicating that our movements are more dynamic.

{"title":"A Practical Framework for Unsupervised Structure Preservation Medical Image Enhancement","abstract":"Medical images are extremely valuable for supporting medical diagnoses. However, in practice, low-quality (LQ) medical images, such as images that are hazy/blurry, have uneven illumination, or are out of focus, among others, are often obtained during data acquisition. This leads to difficulties in the screening and diagnosis of medical diseases. Several generative adversarial networks (GAN)-based image enhancement methods have been proposed and have shown promising results. However, there is a quality-originality trade-off among these methods in the sense that they produce visually pleasing results but lose the ability to preserve originality, especially the structural inputs. Moreover, to our knowledge, there is no objective metric in evaluating the structure preservation of medical image enhancement methods in unsupervised settings due to the unavailability of paired ground-truth data. In this study, we propose a framework for practical unsupervised medical image enhancement that includes (1) a non-reference objective evaluation of structure preservation for medical image enhancement tasks called Laplacian structural similarity index measure (LaSSIM), which is based on SSIM and the Laplacian pyramid, and (2) a novel unsupervised GAN-based method called Laplacian medical image enhancement (LaMEGAN) to support the improvement of both originality and quality from LQ images. The LaSSIM metric does not require clean reference images and has been shown to be superior to SSIM in capturing image structural changes under image degradations, such as strong blurring on different datasets. The experiments demonstrated that our LaMEGAN achieves a satisfactory balance between quality and originality, with robust structure preservation performance while generating compelling visual results with very high image quality scores.

The vector representations of the images obtained from the pre-trained ConvNet can then be considered as encodings of the handwriting style. We exploit such representations for Writer Retrieval, Writer Identification, Writer Verification, and Writer Classification and demonstrate that our pre-training strategy allows extracting rich representations of the writers' style that enable the aforementioned tasks with competitive results with respect to task-specific State-of-the-Art approaches.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01842v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"BugNIST -- A New Large Scale Volumetric 3D Image Dataset for Classification and Detection","abstract":"Progress in 3D volumetric image analysis research is limited by the lack of datasets and most advances in analysis methods for volumetric images are based on medical data. However, medical data do not necessarily resemble the characteristics of other volumetric images such as micro-CT. To promote research in 3D volumetric image analysis beyond medical data, we have created the BugNIST dataset and made it freely available. BugNIST is an extensive dataset of micro-CT scans of 12 types of bugs, such as insects and larvae. BugNIST contains 9437 volumes where 9087 are of individual bugs and 350 are mixtures of bugs and other material. The goal of BugNIST is to benchmark classification and detection methods, and we have designed the detection challenge such that detection models are trained on scans of individual bugs and tested on bug mixtures. Models capable of solving this task will be independent of the context, i.e., the surrounding material. This is a great advantage if the context is unknown or changing, as is often the case in micro-CT. Our initial baseline analysis shows that current state-of-the-art deep learning methods classify individual bugs very well, but has great difficulty with the detection challenge. Hereby, BugNIST enables research in image analysis areas that until now have missed relevant data - both classification, detection, and hopefully more.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01838v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Sibling Rivalry: SNeIa Diversity and the Hubble Tension","abstract":"Thermonuclear supernovae, or Type-Ia supernovae (SNeIa), are an essential tool of cosmology. Precise cosmological constraints are extracted from a Hubble diagram defined by homogeneous distance indicators, but supernova homogeneity is not guaranteed. The degree of heterogeneity within the SNeIa parent population is unknown. In addition, event selections and standardization procedures are based on empirical, optically-measured observables rather than fundamental thermonuclear properties. Systematics are a natural consequence of event selection from a diverse parent population. Quantifying the impact of diversity-driven systematics is crucial to optimizing SNeIa as cosmic probes. In this work, the empirical observables are used to calibrate previously unidentified diversity-driven systematic uncertainties. The foundation of this approach is the concept of \"supernova siblings'', two or more supernovae hosted by the same parent galaxy. Sibling-based calibrations isolate intrinsic differences between supernovae; they control for source distance and host galaxy dependencies that can conceal systematics or lead to their underestimation. Newly calibrated distance modulus uncertainties are approximately an order of magnitude larger than previously reported. The physical origin of these uncertainties is plausibly attributed to the diverse thermonuclear scenarios responsible for SNeIa and the inhomogeneous apparent magnitudes induced by this diversity. Systematics mitigation strategies are discussed. Cosmological parameter constraints extracted from a re-analysis of the Pantheon+ SNeIa dataset are weaker than previously reported. Agreement with early-Universe parameter estimates is achieved for a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, including a reduction of the Hubble Tension from $\\sim$5$\\sigma$ to <1$\\sigma$.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01831v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Learning to Name Classes for Vision and Language Models","abstract":"Large scale vision and language models can achieve impressive zero-shot recognition performance by mapping class specific text queries to image content. Two distinct challenges that remain however, are high sensitivity to the choice of handcrafted class names that define queries, and the difficulty of adaptation to new, smaller datasets. Towards addressing these problems, we propose to leverage available data to learn, for each class, an optimal word embedding as a function of the visual content. By learning new word embeddings on an otherwise frozen model, we are able to retain zero-shot capabilities for new classes, easily adapt models to new datasets, and adjust potentially erroneous, non-descriptive or ambiguous class names. We show that our solution can easily be integrated in image classification and object detection pipelines, yields significant performance gains in multiple scenarios and provides insights into model biases and labelling errors.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01830v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"CoreDiff: Contextual Error-Modulated Generalized Diffusion Model for Low-Dose CT Denoising and Generalization","abstract":"Low-dose computed tomography (CT) images suffer from noise and artifacts due to photon starvation and electronic noise. Recently, some works have attempted to use diffusion models to address the over-smoothness and training instability encountered by previous deep-learning-based denoising models. However, diffusion models suffer from long inference times due to the large number of sampling steps involved. Very recently, cold diffusion model generalizes classical diffusion models and has greater flexibility. Inspired by the cold diffusion, this paper presents a novel COntextual eRror-modulated gEneralized Diffusion model for low-dose CT (LDCT) denoising, termed CoreDiff. First, CoreDiff utilizes LDCT images to displace the random Gaussian noise and employs a novel mean-preserving degradation operator to mimic the physical process of CT degradation, significantly reducing sampling steps thanks to the informative LDCT images as the starting point of the sampling process. Second, to alleviate the error accumulation problem caused by the imperfect restoration operator in the sampling process, we propose a novel ContextuaL Error-modulAted Restoration Network (CLEAR-Net), which can leverage contextual information to constrain the sampling process from structural distortion and modulate time step embedding features for better alignment with the input at the next time step. Third, to rapidly generalize to a new, unseen dose level with as few resources as possible, we devise a one-shot learning framework to make CoreDiff generalize faster and better using only a single LDCT image (un)paired with NDCT. Extensive experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our CoreDiff outperforms competing methods in denoising and generalization performance, with a clinically acceptable inference time.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01814v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Bridging the Gap between Model Explanations in Partially Annotated Multi-label Classification","abstract":"Due to the expensive costs of collecting labels in multi-label classification datasets, partially annotated multi-label classification has become an emerging field in computer vision. One baseline approach to this task is to assume unobserved labels as negative labels, but this assumption induces label noise as a form of false negative. To understand the negative impact caused by false negative labels, we study how these labels affect the model's explanation. We observe that the explanation of two models, trained with full and partial labels each, highlights similar regions but with different scaling, where the latter tends to have lower attribution scores. Based on these findings, we propose to boost the attribution scores of the model trained with partial labels to make its explanation resemble that of the model trained with full labels. Even with the conceptually simple approach, the multi-label classification performance improves by a large margin in three different datasets on a single positive label setting and one on a large-scale partial label setting.

We developed a novel, interactive human-in-the-loop topic modeling system with a user-friendly interface that enables users compare and record every step they take, and a novel topic words suggestion feature to help users provide feedback that is faithful to the ground truth. Our system also supports not only what traditional topic models can do, i.e., learning the topics from the whole corpus, but also targeted topic modelling, i.e., learning topics for specific aspects of the corpus. In this article, we provide an overview of the system and present the results of a series of user studies designed to assess the value of the system in progressively more realistic applications of topic modelling.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01774v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Black Box Few-Shot Adaptation for Vision-Language models","abstract":"Vision-Language (V-L) models trained with contrastive learning to align the visual and language modalities have been shown to be strong few-shot learners. Soft prompt learning is the method of choice for few-shot downstream adaption aiming to bridge the modality gap caused by the distribution shift induced by the new domain. While parameter-efficient, prompt learning still requires access to the model weights and can be computationally infeasible for large models with billions of parameters. To address these shortcomings, in this work, we describe a black-box method for V-L few-shot adaptation that (a) operates on pre-computed image and text features and hence works without access to the model's weights, (b) it is orders of magnitude faster at training time, (c) it is amenable to both supervised and unsupervised training, and (d) it can be even used to align image and text features computed from uni-modal models. To achieve this, we propose Linear Feature Alignment (LFA), a simple linear approach for V-L re-alignment in the target domain. LFA is initialized from a closed-form solution to a least-squares problem and then it is iteratively updated by minimizing a re-ranking loss. Despite its simplicity, our approach can even surpass soft-prompt learning methods as shown by extensive experiments on 11 image and 2 video datasets.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01752v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Learning Invariant Representation via Contrastive Feature Alignment for Clutter Robust SAR Target Recognition","abstract":"The deep neural networks (DNNs) have freed the synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR ATR) from expertise-based feature designing and demonstrated superiority over conventional solutions. There has been shown the unique deficiency of ground vehicle benchmarks in shapes of strong background correlation results in DNNs overfitting the clutter and being non-robust to unfamiliar surroundings. However, the gap between fixed background model training and varying background application remains underexplored. Inspired by contrastive learning, this letter proposes a solution called Contrastive Feature Alignment (CFA) aiming to learn invariant representation for robust recognition. The proposed method contributes a mixed clutter variants generation strategy and a new inference branch equipped with channel-weighted mean square error (CWMSE) loss for invariant representation learning. In specific, the generation strategy is delicately designed to better attract clutter-sensitive deviation in feature space. The CWMSE loss is further devised to better contrast this deviation and align the deep features activated by the original images and corresponding clutter variants. The proposed CFA combines both classification and CWMSE losses to train the model jointly, which allows for the progressive learning of invariant target representation. Extensive evaluations on the MSTAR dataset and six DNN models prove the effectiveness of our proposal. The results demonstrated that the CFA-trained models are capable of recognizing targets among unfamiliar surroundings that are not included in the dataset, and are robust to varying signal-to-clutter ratios.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01747v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Bounding probabilities of causation through the causal marginal problem","abstract":"Probabilities of Causation play a fundamental role in decision making in law, health care and public policy. Nevertheless, their point identification is challenging, requiring strong assumptions such as monotonicity. In the absence of such assumptions, existing work requires multiple observations of datasets that contain the same treatment and outcome variables, in order to establish bounds on these probabilities. However, in many clinical trials and public policy evaluation cases, there exist independent datasets that examine the effect of a different treatment each on the same outcome variable. Here, we outline how to significantly tighten existing bounds on the probabilities of causation, by imposing counterfactual consistency between SCMs constructed from such independent datasets ('causal marginal problem'). Next, we describe a new information theoretic approach on falsification of counterfactual probabilities, using conditional mutual information to quantify counterfactual influence. The latter generalises to arbitrary discrete variables and number of treatments, and renders the causal marginal problem more interpretable. Since the question of 'tight enough' is left to the user, we provide an additional method of inference when the bounds are unsatisfactory: A maximum entropy based method that defines a metric for the space of plausible SCMs and proposes the entropy maximising SCM for inferring counterfactuals in the absence of more information.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02023v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"Privacy-Preserving Federated Discovery of DNA Motifs with Differential Privacy","abstract":"DNA motif discovery is an important issue in gene research, which aims to identify transcription factor binding sites (i.e., motifs) in DNA sequences to reveal the mechanisms that regulate gene expression. However, the phenomenon of data silos and the problem of privacy leakage have seriously hindered the development of DNA motif discovery. On the one hand, the phenomenon of data silos makes data collection difficult. On the other hand, the collection and use of DNA data become complicated and difficult because DNA is sensitive private information. In this context, how discovering DNA motifs under the premise of ensuring privacy and security and alleviating data silos has become a very important issue. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method, namely DP-FLMD, to address this problem. Note that this is the first application of federated learning to the field of genetics research. The federated learning technique is used to solve the problem of data silos. It has the advantage of enabling multiple participants to train models together and providing privacy protection services. To address the challenges of federated learning in terms of communication costs, this paper applies a sampling method and a strategy for reducing communication costs to DP-FLMD. In addition, differential privacy, a privacy protection technique with rigorous mathematical proof, is also applied to DP-FLMD. Experiments on the DNA datasets show that DP-FLMD has high mining accuracy and runtime efficiency, and the performance of the algorithm is affected by some parameters.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01689v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

A critical issue disturbing the training of an image-to-video model is the ambiguity of the frame ordering since both the forward and backward sequences are plausible solutions. This paper proposes an effective self-supervised ordering scheme that allows training high-quality image-to-video deblurring models. Unlike previous methods that rely on order-invariant losses, we assign an explicit order for each video sequence, thus avoiding the order-ambiguity issue. Specifically, we map each video sequence to a vector in a latent high-dimensional space so that there exists a hyperplane such that for every video sequence, the vectors extracted from it and its reversed sequence are on different sides of the hyperplane. The side of the vectors will be used to define the order of the corresponding sequence.

In this paper, we show that fine-tuning an out-of-the-box neural captioner with a self-supervised discriminative communication objective helps to recover a plain, visually descriptive language that is more informative about image contents. Given a target image, the system must learn to produce a description that enables an out-of-the-box text-conditioned image retriever to identify such image among a set of candidates. We experiment with the popular ClipCap captioner, also replicating the main results with BLIP. In terms of similarity to ground-truth human descriptions, the captions emerging from discriminative finetuning lag slightly behind those generated by the non-finetuned model, when the latter is trained and tested on the same caption dataset. However, when the model is used without further tuning to generate captions for out-of-domain datasets, our discriminatively-finetuned captioner generates descriptions that resemble human references more than those produced by the same captioner without finetuning. We further show that, on the Conceptual Captions dataset, discriminatively finetuned captions are more helpful than either vanilla ClipCap captions or ground-truth captions for human annotators tasked with an image discrimination task.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01662v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

Notably, atom-centered machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are a promising pathway to accurately model the potential energy surface of highly-disordered systems, such as LDRs, where the performance of such MLIPs have not been rigorously explored yet. Here, we represent a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy, transferability, and ease of training of five MLIPs in modelling LDRs, including artificial neural network potential developed by the atomic energy network (AENET), Gaussian approximation potential (GAP), spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) and its quadratic extension (qSNAP), and moment tensor potential (MTP). Specifically, we generate a DFT-calculated dataset of 10842 disordered LiTMO$_2$ and TMO$_2$ configurations, where TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and/or Cu. Importantly, we find AENET to be the best in terms of accuracy and transferability for energy predictions, while MTP is the best for atomic forces. While AENET is the fastest to train at low number of epochs, the training time increases significantly as epochs increase, with a corresponding reduction in training errors. Note that AENET and GAP tend to overfit in small datasets, with the extent of overfitting reducing with larger datasets. Finally, we observe AENET to provide reasonable predictions of average Li-intercalation voltages in layered, single-TM LiTMO$_2$ frameworks, compared to DFT ($\\sim$10% error on average).

The use of biometric data permits an individuation so exact that the data is utilized effectively in identification and authentication systems. But for this same reason, privacy protections become indispensably necessary.   Privacy protection is extensively afforded by the technique of anonymization. Anonymization techniques obfuscate or remove the sensitive personal data to achieve high levels of anonymity. However, the effectiveness of anonymization relies, in equal parts, on the effectiveness of the methods employed to evaluate anonymization performance.   In this paper, we assess the state-of-the-art methods used to evaluate the performance of anonymization techniques for facial images and gait patterns. We demonstrate that the state-of-the-art evaluation methods have serious and frequent shortcomings. In particular, we find that the underlying assumptions of the state-of-the-art are quite unwarranted. When a method evaluating the performance of anonymization assumes a weak adversary or a weak recognition scenario, then the resulting evaluation will very likely be a gross overestimation of the anonymization performance. Therefore, we propose a stronger adversary model which is alert to the recognition scenario as well as to the anonymization scenario. Our adversary model implements an appropriate measure of anonymization performance. We improve the selection process for the evaluation dataset, and we reduce the numbers of identities contained in the dataset while ensuring that these identities remain easily distinguishable from one another. Our novel evaluation methodology surpasses the state-of-the-art because we measure worst-case performance and so deliver a highly reliable evaluation of biometric anonymization techniques.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01635v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"Self-Supervised Image Denoising for Real-World Images with Context-aware Transformer","abstract":"In recent years, the development of deep learning has been pushing image denoising to a new level. Among them, self-supervised denoising is increasingly popular because it does not require any prior knowledge. Most of the existing self-supervised methods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are restricted by the locality of the receptive field and would cause color shifts or textures loss. In this paper, we propose a novel Denoise Transformer for real-world image denoising, which is mainly constructed with Context-aware Denoise Transformer (CADT) units and Secondary Noise Extractor (SNE) block. CADT is designed as a dual-branch structure, where the global branch uses a window-based Transformer encoder to extract the global information, while the local branch focuses on the extraction of local features with small receptive field. By incorporating CADT as basic components, we build a hierarchical network to directly learn the noise distribution information through residual learning and obtain the first stage denoised output. Then, we design SNE in low computation for secondary global noise extraction. Finally the blind spots are collected from the Denoise Transformer output and reconstructed, forming the final denoised image. Extensive experiments on the real-world SIDD benchmark achieve 50.62/0.990 for PSNR/SSIM, which is competitive with the current state-of-the-art method and only 0.17/0.001 lower. Visual comparisons on public sRGB, Raw-RGB and greyscale datasets prove that our proposed Denoise Transformer has a competitive performance, especially on blurred textures and low-light images, without using additional knowledge, e.g., noise level or noise type, regarding the underlying unknown noise.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01627v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"Image Blind Denoising Using Dual Convolutional Neural Network with Skip Connection","abstract":"In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks have shown fascinating performance in the field of image denoising. However, deeper network architectures are often accompanied with large numbers of model parameters, leading to high training cost and long inference time, which limits their application in practical denoising tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel dual convolutional blind denoising network with skip connection (DCBDNet), which is able to achieve a desirable balance between the denoising effect and network complexity. The proposed DCBDNet consists of a noise estimation network and a dual convolutional neural network (CNN). The noise estimation network is used to estimate the noise level map, which improves the flexibility of the proposed model. The dual CNN contains two branches: a u-shaped sub-network is designed for the upper branch, and the lower branch is composed of the dilated convolution layers. Skip connections between layers are utilized in both the upper and lower branches. The proposed DCBDNet was evaluated on several synthetic and real-world image denoising benchmark datasets. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed DCBDNet can effectively remove gaussian noise in a wide range of levels, spatially variant noise and real noise.

{"title":"EDeR: A Dataset for Exploring Dependency Relations Between Events","abstract":"Relation extraction is a central task in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) research. We argue that an important type of relation not explored in NLP or IR research to date is that of an event being an argument - required or optional - of another event. We introduce the human-annotated Event Dependency Relation dataset (EDeR) which provides this dependency relation. The annotation is done on a sample of documents from the OntoNotes dataset, which has the added benefit that it integrates with existing, orthogonal, annotations of this dataset. We investigate baseline approaches for predicting the event dependency relation, the best of which achieves an accuracy of 82.61 for binary argument/non-argument classification. We show that recognizing this relation leads to more accurate event extraction (semantic role labelling) and can improve downstream tasks that depend on this, such as co-reference resolution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that predicting the three-way classification into the required argument, optional argument or non-argument is a more challenging task.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01612v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Locate Then Generate: Bridging Vision and Language with Bounding Box for Scene-Text VQA","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal framework for Scene Text Visual Question Answering (STVQA), which requires models to read scene text in images for question answering. Apart from text or visual objects, which could exist independently, scene text naturally links text and visual modalities together by conveying linguistic semantics while being a visual object in an image simultaneously. Different to conventional STVQA models which take the linguistic semantics and visual semantics in scene text as two separate features, in this paper, we propose a paradigm of \"Locate Then Generate\" (LTG), which explicitly unifies this two semantics with the spatial bounding box as a bridge connecting them. Specifically, at first, LTG locates the region in an image that may contain the answer words with an answer location module (ALM) consisting of a region proposal network and a language refinement network, both of which can transform to each other with one-to-one mapping via the scene text bounding box. Next, given the answer words selected by ALM, LTG generates a readable answer sequence with an answer generation module (AGM) based on a pre-trained language model. As a benefit of the explicit alignment of the visual and linguistic semantics, even without any scene text based pre-training tasks, LTG can boost the absolute accuracy by +6.06% and +6.92% on the TextVQA dataset and the ST-VQA dataset respectively, compared with a non-pre-training baseline. We further demonstrate that LTG effectively unifies visual and text modalities through the spatial bounding box connection, which is underappreciated in previous methods.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01603v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"MM-BSN: Self-Supervised Image Denoising for Real-World with Multi-Mask based on Blind-Spot Network","abstract":"Recent advances in deep learning have been pushing image denoising techniques to a new level. In self-supervised image denoising, blind-spot network (BSN) is one of the most common methods. However, most of the existing BSN algorithms use a dot-based central mask, which is recognized as inefficient for images with large-scale spatially correlated noise. In this paper, we give the definition of large-noise and propose a multi-mask strategy using multiple convolutional kernels masked in different shapes to further break the noise spatial correlation. Furthermore, we propose a novel self-supervised image denoising method that combines the multi-mask strategy with BSN (MM-BSN). We show that different masks can cause significant performance differences, and the proposed MM-BSN can efficiently fuse the features extracted by multi-masked layers, while recovering the texture structures destroyed by multi-masking and information transmission. Our MM-BSN can be used to address the problem of large-noise denoising, which cannot be efficiently handled by other BSN methods. Extensive experiments on public real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed MM-BSN achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised and even unpaired image denoising methods for sRGB images denoising, without any labelling effort or prior knowledge.

{"title":"Multi-Channel Time-Series Person and Soft-Biometric Identification","abstract":"Multi-channel time-series datasets are popular in the context of human activity recognition (HAR). On-body device (OBD) recordings of human movements are often preferred for HAR applications not only for their reliability but as an approach for identity protection, e.g., in industrial settings. Contradictory, the gait activity is a biometric, as the cyclic movement is distinctive and collectable. In addition, the gait cycle has proven to contain soft-biometric information of human groups, such as age and height. Though general human movements have not been considered a biometric, they might contain identity information. This work investigates person and soft-biometrics identification from OBD recordings of humans performing different activities using deep architectures. Furthermore, we propose the use of attribute representation for soft-biometric identification. We evaluate the method on four datasets of multi-channel time-series HAR, measuring the performance of a person and soft-biometrics identification and its relation concerning performed activities. We find that person identification is not limited to gait activity. The impact of activities on the identification performance was found to be training and dataset specific. Soft-biometric based attribute representation shows promising results and emphasis the necessity of larger datasets.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01585v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Untargeted Near-collision Attacks in Biometric Recognition","abstract":"A biometric recognition system can operate in two distinct modes, identification or verification. In the first mode, the system recognizes an individual by searching the enrolled templates of all the users for a match. In the second mode, the system validates a claimed identity by comparing the fresh template with the enrolled template for this identity. Both the experimentally determined false match rate and false non-match rate through recognition threshold adjustment define the recognition accuracy, and hence the security of the system. The biometric transformation schemes usually produce binary templates that are better handled by cryptographic schemes. One of the requirements for these transformation schemes is their irreversibility. In this work, we rely on probabilistic modelling to quantify the security strength of binary templates. We investigate the influence of template size, database size and threshold on the probability of having a near-collision, and we highlight two attacks on biometric systems. We discuss the choice of parameters through the generic presented attacks.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01580v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Form-NLU: Dataset for the Form Language Understanding","abstract":"Compared to general document analysis tasks, form document structure understanding and retrieval are challenging.

Hence, the form values may not be aligned with the form designer's intention (structure and keys) if a form user gets confused. In this paper, we introduce Form-NLU, the first novel dataset for form structure understanding and its key and value information extraction, interpreting the form designer's intent and the alignment of user-written value on it. It consists of 857 form images, 6k form keys and values, and 4k table keys and values.

Using this dataset, Form-NLU, we first examine strong object detection models for the form layout understanding, then evaluate the key information extraction task on the dataset, providing fine-grained results for different types of forms and keys.

{"title":"MESAHA-Net: Multi-Encoders based Self-Adaptive Hard Attention Network with Maximum Intensity Projections for Lung Nodule Segmentation in CT Scan","abstract":"Accurate lung nodule segmentation is crucial for early-stage lung cancer diagnosis, as it can substantially enhance patient survival rates. Computed tomography (CT) images are widely employed for early diagnosis in lung nodule analysis. However, the heterogeneity of lung nodules, size diversity, and the complexity of the surrounding environment pose challenges for developing robust nodule segmentation methods. In this study, we propose an efficient end-to-end framework, the multi-encoder-based self-adaptive hard attention network (MESAHA-Net), for precise lung nodule segmentation in CT scans. MESAHA-Net comprises three encoding paths, an attention block, and a decoder block, facilitating the integration of three types of inputs: CT slice patches, forward and backward maximum intensity projection (MIP) images, and region of interest (ROI) masks encompassing the nodule. By employing a novel adaptive hard attention mechanism, MESAHA-Net iteratively performs slice-by-slice 2D segmentation of lung nodules, focusing on the nodule region in each slice to generate 3D volumetric segmentation of lung nodules. The proposed framework has been comprehensively evaluated on the LIDC-IDRI dataset, the largest publicly available dataset for lung nodule segmentation. The results demonstrate that our approach is highly robust for various lung nodule types, outperforming previous state-of-the-art techniques in terms of segmentation accuracy and computational complexity, rendering it suitable for real-time clinical implementation.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01576v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}
{"title":"Spatiotemporal and Semantic Zero-inflated Urban Anomaly Prediction","abstract":"Urban anomaly predictions, such as traffic accident prediction and crime prediction, are of vital importance to smart city security and maintenance. Existing methods typically use deep learning to capture the intra-dependencies in spatial and temporal dimensions. However, numerous key challenges remain unsolved, for instance, sparse zero-inflated data due to urban anomalies occurring with low frequency (which can lead to poor performance on real-world datasets), and both intra- and inter-dependencies of abnormal patterns across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. Moreover, a unified approach to predict multiple kinds of anomaly is left to explore. In this paper, we propose STS to jointly capture the intra- and inter-dependencies between the patterns and the influential factors in three dimensions. Further, we use a multi-task prediction module with a customized loss function to solve the zero-inflated issue. To verify the effectiveness of the model, we apply it to two urban anomaly prediction tasks, crime prediction and traffic accident risk prediction, respectively. Experiments on two application scenarios with four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of STS, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the mean absolute error and the root mean square error by 37.88% and 18.10% on zero-inflated datasets, and, 60.32% and 37.28% on non-zero datasets, respectively.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01569v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

In this paper, we propose a novel attribute-consistent knowledge graph representation learning framework for MMEA (ACK-MMEA) to compensate the contextual gaps through incorporating consistent alignment knowledge. Attribute-consistent KGs (ACKGs) are first constructed via multi-modal attribute uniformization with merge and generate operators so that each entity has one and only one uniform feature in each modality. The ACKGs are then fed into a relation-aware graph neural network with random dropouts, to obtain aggregated relation representations and robust entity representations. In order to evaluate the ACK-MMEA facilitated for entity alignment, we specially design a joint alignment loss for both entity and attribute evaluation.

How to effectively encode the delivery address is a core task to boost the performance of downstream tasks in the logistics system. Pre-trained Models (PTMs) designed for Natural Language Process (NLP) have emerged as the dominant tools for encoding semantic information in text. Though promising, those NLP-based PTMs fall short of encoding geographic knowledge in the delivery address, which considerably trims down the performance of delivery-related tasks in logistic systems such as Cainiao. To tackle the above problem, we propose a domain-specific pre-trained model, named G2PTL, a Geography-Graph Pre-trained model for delivery address in Logistics field. G2PTL combines the semantic learning capabilities of text pre-training with the geographical-relationship encoding abilities of graph modeling. Specifically, we first utilize real-world logistics delivery data to construct a large-scale heterogeneous graph of delivery addresses, which contains abundant geographic knowledge and delivery information. Then, G2PTL is pre-trained with subgraphs sampled from the heterogeneous graph. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of G2PTL through four downstream tasks in logistics systems on real-world datasets. G2PTL has been deployed in production in Cainiao's logistics system, which significantly improves the performance of delivery-related tasks.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01559v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

We establish an MTDA baseline for 3D point cloud data by proposing to mix the feature representations from all domains together to achieve better domain adaptation performance by an ensemble average, which we call Mixup Ensemble Average or MEnsA.

It uses multi-view camera data to learn a transformer model that directly projects the perception of the road environment onto the BEV perspective. However, training a transformer model often requires a large amount of data, and as camera data for road traffic is often private, it is typically not shared. Federated learning offers a solution that enables clients to collaborate and train models without exchanging data. In this paper, we propose FedBEVT, a federated transformer learning approach for BEV perception.

{"title":"Robust Outlier Rejection for 3D Registration with Variational Bayes","abstract":"Learning-based outlier (mismatched correspondence) rejection for robust 3D registration generally formulates the outlier removal as an inlier/outlier classification problem. The core for this to be successful is to learn the discriminative inlier/outlier feature representations. In this paper, we develop a novel variational non-local network-based outlier rejection framework for robust alignment. By reformulating the non-local feature learning with variational Bayesian inference, the Bayesian-driven long-range dependencies can be modeled to aggregate discriminative geometric context information for inlier/outlier distinction. Specifically, to achieve such Bayesian-driven contextual dependencies, each query/key/value component in our non-local network predicts a prior feature distribution and a posterior one. Embedded with the inlier/outlier label, the posterior feature distribution is label-dependent and discriminative. Thus, pushing the prior to be close to the discriminative posterior in the training step enables the features sampled from this prior at test time to model high-quality long-range dependencies. Notably, to achieve effective posterior feature guidance, a specific probabilistic graphical model is designed over our non-local model, which lets us derive a variational low bound as our optimization objective for model training. Finally, we propose a voting-based inlier searching strategy to cluster the high-quality hypothetical inliers for transformation estimation. Extensive experiments on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets verify the effectiveness of our method.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01514v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

However, in many real-world situations, the data distributions are not stationary and they can change over time while reducing the accuracy of the forecasting models, which in the ML literature is known as concept drift. Handling concept drift in forecasting is essential for many ML methods in use nowadays, however, the prior work only proposes methods to handle concept drift in the classification domain. To fill this gap, we explore concept drift handling methods in particular for Global Forecasting Models (GFM) which recently have gained popularity in the forecasting domain. We propose two new concept drift handling methods, namely: Error Contribution Weighting (ECW) and Gradient Descent Weighting (GDW), based on a continuous adaptive weighting concept. These methods use two forecasting models which are separately trained with the most recent series and all series, and finally, the weighted average of the forecasts provided by the two models are considered as the final forecasts.

The running time of the algorithm (and consequently the size and evaluation time of the hypothesis) is also $2^{\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}/\\varepsilon)}$, nearly matching the lower bound of Blais et al (RANDOM '15). We also give an algorithm for estimating up to additive error $\\varepsilon$ the distance of an unknown function $f$ to monotone using a run-time of $2^{\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}/\\varepsilon)}$. Previously, for both of these problems, sample-efficient algorithms were known, but these algorithms were not run-time efficient. Our work thus closes this gap in our knowledge between the run-time and sample complexity.   This work builds upon the improper learning algorithm of Bshouty and Tamon (JACM '96) and the proper semiagnostic learning algorithm of Lange, Rubinfeld, and Vasilyan (FOCS '22), which obtains a non-monotone Boolean-valued hypothesis, then ``corrects'' it to monotone using query-efficient local computation algorithms on graphs. This black-box correction approach can achieve no error better than $2\\mathrm{opt} + \\varepsilon$ information-theoretically; we bypass this barrier by   a) augmenting the improper learner with a convex optimization step, and   b) learning and correcting a real-valued function before rounding its values to Boolean.

However, corresponding class labels are noisy when provided by error-prone annotators, e.g., crowd workers.

We address this issue by presenting a probabilistic training framework named multi-annotator deep learning (MaDL). A ground truth and an annotator performance model are jointly trained in an end-to-end learning approach. The ground truth model learns to predict instances' true class labels, while the annotator performance model infers probabilistic estimates of annotators' performances. A modular network architecture enables us to make varying assumptions regarding annotators' performances, e.g., an optional class or instance dependency. Further, we learn annotator embeddings to estimate annotators' densities within a latent space as proxies of their potentially correlated annotations. Together with a weighted loss function, we improve the learning from correlated annotation patterns. In a comprehensive evaluation, we examine three research questions about multi-annotator supervised learning.

For the cost of matching, we suggest a number of modules that can be freely combined or replaced with other modules, including the relative unbalanced ink transport between registered components, the distance between the transformations required for registration, and the difference in prespecified labels.   We give a concrete example of a kanji distance function obtained in this way as a proof of concept. Based on this function, we produce 2D kanji maps by multidimensional scaling and a table of 100 randomly selected J\\=oj\\=o kanji with their 16 nearest neighbors.   Our kanji distance functions can be used to help Japanese learners from non-CJK backgrounds acquire kanji literacy. In addition, they may assist editors of kanji dictionaries in presenting their materials and may serve in text processing and optical character recognition systems for assessing the likelihood of errors.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02493v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Learning to Name Classes for Vision and Language Models","abstract":"Large scale vision and language models can achieve impressive zero-shot recognition performance by mapping class specific text queries to image content. Two distinct challenges that remain however, are high sensitivity to the choice of handcrafted class names that define queries, and the difficulty of adaptation to new, smaller datasets. Towards addressing these problems, we propose to leverage available data to learn, for each class, an optimal word embedding as a function of the visual content. By learning new word embeddings on an otherwise frozen model, we are able to retain zero-shot capabilities for new classes, easily adapt models to new datasets, and adjust potentially erroneous, non-descriptive or ambiguous class names. We show that our solution can easily be integrated in image classification and object detection pipelines, yields significant performance gains in multiple scenarios and provides insights into model biases and labelling errors.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01830v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Divided Attention: Unsupervised Multi-Object Discovery with Contextually Separated Slots","abstract":"We introduce a method to segment the visual field into independently moving regions, trained with no ground truth or supervision. It consists of an adversarial conditional encoder-decoder architecture based on Slot Attention, modified to use the image as context to decode optical flow without attempting to reconstruct the image itself. In the resulting multi-modal representation, one modality (flow) feeds the encoder to produce separate latent codes (slots), whereas the other modality (image) conditions the decoder to generate the first (flow) from the slots. This design frees the representation from having to encode complex nuisance variability in the image due to, for instance, illumination and reflectance properties of the scene. Since customary autoencoding based on minimizing the reconstruction error does not preclude the entire flow from being encoded into a single slot, we modify the loss to an adversarial criterion based on Contextual Information Separation. The resulting min-max optimization fosters the separation of objects and their assignment to different attention slots, leading to Divided Attention, or DivA. DivA outperforms recent unsupervised multi-object motion segmentation methods while tripling run-time speed up to 104FPS and reducing the performance gap from supervised methods to 12% or less. DivA can handle different numbers of objects and different image sizes at training and test time, is invariant to permutation of object labels, and does not require explicit regularization.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01430v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"A Scale-Invariant Trajectory Simplification Method for Efficient Data Collection in Videos","abstract":"Training data is a critical requirement for machine learning tasks, and labeled training data can be expensive to acquire, often requiring manual or semi-automated data collection pipelines. For tracking applications, the data collection involves drawing bounding boxes around the classes of interest on each frame, and associate detections of the same \"instance\" over frames. In a semi-automated data collection pipeline, this can be achieved by running a baseline detection and tracking algorithm, and relying on manual correction to add/remove/change bounding boxes on each frame, as well as resolving errors in the associations over frames (track switches). In this paper, we propose a data correction pipeline to generate ground-truth data more efficiently in this semi-automated scenario. Our method simplifies the trajectories from the tracking systems and let the annotator verify and correct the objects in the sampled keyframes. Once the objects in the keyframes are corrected, the bounding boxes in the other frames are obtained by interpolation. Our method achieves substantial reduction in the number of frames requiring manual correction. In the MOT dataset, it reduces the number of frames by 30x while maintaining a HOTA score of 89.61% . Moreover, it reduces the number of frames by a factor of 10x while achieving a HOTA score of 79.24% in the SoccerNet dataset, and 85.79% in the DanceTrack dataset.

{"title":"Towards Integration of Discriminability and Robustness for Document-Level Relation Extraction","abstract":"Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) predicts relations for entity pairs that rely on long-range context-dependent reasoning in a document. As a typical multi-label classification problem, DocRE faces the challenge of effectively distinguishing a small set of positive relations from the majority of negative ones. This challenge becomes even more difficult to overcome when there exists a significant number of annotation errors in the dataset. In this work, we aim to achieve better integration of both the discriminability and robustness for the DocRE problem. Specifically, we first design an effective loss function to endow high discriminability to both probabilistic outputs and internal representations. We innovatively customize entropy minimization and supervised contrastive learning for the challenging multi-label and long-tailed learning problems. To ameliorate the impact of label errors, we equipped our method with a novel negative label sampling strategy to strengthen the model robustness. In addition, we introduce two new data regimes to mimic more realistic scenarios with annotation errors and evaluate our sampling strategy. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of each component and show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on the DocRED dataset, its recently cleaned version, Re-DocRED, and the proposed data regimes.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00824v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Rotating labeling of entropy coders for synthetic DNA data storage","abstract":"Over the past years, the ever-growing trend on data storage demand, more specifically for \"cold\" data (i.e. rarely accessed), has motivated research for alternative systems of data storage. Because of its biochemical characteristics, synthetic DNA molecules are considered as potential candidates for a new storage paradigm. Because of this trend, several coding solutions have been proposed over the past years for the storage of digital information into DNA. Despite being a promising solution, DNA storage faces two major obstacles: the large cost of synthesis and the noise introduced during sequencing. Additionally, this noise increases when biochemically defined coding constraints are not respected: avoiding homopolymers and patterns, as well as balancing the GC content. This paper describes a novel entropy coder which can be embedded to any block-based image-coding schema and aims to robustify the decoded results. Our proposed solution introduces variability in the generated quaternary streams, reduces the amount of homopolymers and repeated patterns to reduce the probability of errors occurring. In this paper, we integrate the proposed entropy coder into four existing JPEG-inspired DNA coders. We then evaluate the quality -- in terms of biochemical constraints -- of the encoded data for all the different methods.","created":"2023-04-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00493v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"LabelVizier: Interactive Validation and Relabeling for Technical Text Annotations","abstract":"With the rapid accumulation of text data produced by data-driven techniques, the task of extracting \"data annotations\"--concise, high-quality data summaries from unstructured raw text--has become increasingly important. The recent advances in weak supervision and crowd-sourcing techniques provide promising solutions to efficiently create annotations (labels) for large-scale technical text data. However, such annotations may fail in practice because of the change in annotation requirements, application scenarios, and modeling goals, where label validation and relabeling by domain experts are required. To approach this issue, we present LabelVizier, a human-in-the-loop workflow that incorporates domain knowledge and user-specific requirements to reveal actionable insights into annotation flaws, then produce better-quality labels for large-scale multi-label datasets. We implement our workflow as an interactive notebook to facilitate flexible error profiling, in-depth annotation validation for three error types, and efficient annotation relabeling on different data scales. We evaluated the efficiency and generalizability of our workflow with two use cases and four expert reviews. The results indicate that LabelVizier is applicable in various application scenarios and assist domain experts with different knowledge backgrounds to efficiently improve technical text annotation quality.","created":"2023-03-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17820v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"FairGen: Towards Fair Graph Generation","abstract":"There have been tremendous efforts over the past decades dedicated to the generation of realistic graphs in a variety of domains, ranging from social networks to computer networks, from gene regulatory networks to online transaction networks. Despite the remarkable success, the vast majority of these works are unsupervised in nature and are typically trained to minimize the expected graph reconstruction loss, which would result in the representation disparity issue in the generated graphs, i.e., the protected groups (often minorities) contribute less to the objective and thus suffer from systematically higher errors. In this paper, we aim to tailor graph generation to downstream mining tasks by leveraging label information and user-preferred parity constraint. In particular, we start from the investigation of representation disparity in the context of graph generative models. To mitigate the disparity, we propose a fairness-aware graph generative model named FairGen. Our model jointly trains a label-informed graph generation module and a fair representation learning module by progressively learning the behaviors of the protected and unprotected groups, from the `easy' concepts to the `hard' ones. In addition, we propose a generic context sampling strategy for graph generative models, which is proven to be capable of fairly capturing the contextual information of each group with a high probability. Experimental results on seven real-world data sets, including web-based graphs, demonstrate that FairGen (1) obtains performance on par with state-of-the-art graph generative models across six network properties, (2) mitigates the representation disparity issues in the generated graphs, and (3) substantially boosts the model performance by up to 17% in downstream tasks via data augmentation.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17743v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

While existing approaches predominantly rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as their backbone network, we propose an innovative method based on the Transformer backbone network. Our approach employs a two-stage incremental learning strategy. In the first stage, we train a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) model exclusively on normal images. Subsequently, in the second stage, we implement pixel-level data augmentation techniques to generate corrupted normal images and their corresponding pixel labels. This process enables the model to learn how to repair corrupted regions and classify the state of each pixel. Ultimately, the model produces a pixel reconstruction error matrix and a pixel anomaly probability matrix, which are combined to create an anomaly scoring matrix that effectively identifies abnormal regions. When compared to several state-of-the-art CNN-based techniques, our method demonstrates superior performance on the MVTec AD dataset, achieving an impressive 97.6% AUC.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17354v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Few-shot Geometry-Aware Keypoint Localization","abstract":"Supervised keypoint localization methods rely on large manually labeled image datasets, where objects can deform, articulate, or occlude. However, creating such large keypoint labels is time-consuming and costly, and is often error-prone due to inconsistent labeling. Thus, we desire an approach that can learn keypoint localization with fewer yet consistently annotated images. To this end, we present a novel formulation that learns to localize semantically consistent keypoint definitions, even for occluded regions, for varying object categories. We use a few user-labeled 2D images as input examples, which are extended via self-supervision using a larger unlabeled dataset. Unlike unsupervised methods, the few-shot images act as semantic shape constraints for object localization. Furthermore, we introduce 3D geometry-aware constraints to uplift keypoints, achieving more accurate 2D localization. Our general-purpose formulation paves the way for semantically conditioned generative modeling and attains competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy on several datasets, including human faces, eyes, animals, cars, and never-before-seen mouth interior (teeth) localization tasks, not attempted by the previous few-shot methods.

{"title":"Discriminative Class Tokens for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models","abstract":"Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the generation of diverse and high-quality images. However, generated images often fall short of depicting subtle details and are susceptible to errors due to ambiguity in the input text. One way of alleviating these issues is to train diffusion models on class-labeled datasets. This comes with a downside, doing so limits their expressive power: (i) supervised datasets are generally small compared to large-scale scraped text-image datasets on which text-to-image models are trained, and so the quality and diversity of generated images are severely affected, or (ii) the input is a hard-coded label, as opposed to free-form text, which limits the control over the generated images.   In this work, we propose a non-invasive fine-tuning technique that capitalizes on the expressive potential of free-form text while achieving high accuracy through discriminative signals from a pretrained classifier, which guides the generation. This is done by iteratively modifying the embedding of a single input token of a text-to-image diffusion model, using the classifier, by steering generated images toward a given target class. Our method is fast compared to prior fine-tuning methods and does not require a collection of in-class images or retraining of a noise-tolerant classifier. We evaluate our method extensively, showing that the generated images are: (i) more accurate and of higher quality than standard diffusion models, (ii) can be used to augment training data in a low-resource setting, and (iii) reveal information about the data used to train the guiding classifier.

{"title":"Towards Understanding the Effect of Pretraining Label Granularity","abstract":"In this paper, we study how pretraining label granularity affects the generalization of deep neural networks in image classification tasks. We focus on the \"fine-to-coarse\" transfer learning setting where the pretraining label is more fine-grained than that of the target problem. We experiment with this method using the label hierarchy of iNaturalist 2021, and observe a 8.76% relative improvement of the error rate over the baseline. We find the following conditions are key for the improvement: 1) the pretraining dataset has a strong and meaningful label hierarchy, 2) its label function strongly aligns with that of the target task, and most importantly, 3) an appropriate level of pretraining label granularity is chosen. The importance of pretraining label granularity is further corroborated by our transfer learning experiments on ImageNet. Most notably, we show that pretraining at the leaf labels of ImageNet21k produces better transfer results on ImageNet1k than pretraining at other coarser granularity levels, which supports the common practice. Theoretically, through an analysis on a two-layer convolutional ReLU network, we prove that: 1) models trained on coarse-grained labels only respond strongly to the common or \"easy-to-learn\" features; 2) with the dataset satisfying the right conditions, fine-grained pretraining encourages the model to also learn rarer or \"harder-to-learn\" features well, thus improving the model's generalization.","created":"2023-03-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16887v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In order to overcome this problem, we propose context-aware language identification using a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning without any text labels. The proposed method learns the context of speech through masked language modeling (MLM) loss and simultaneously trains to determine the language of the utterance with supervised learning loss.

Previous approaches were based on Fourier analysis, which is quite robust for some scenarios but fails in some others, in machine learning tools, that involve pre-labeling of the painting at hand, or the segmentation of thread crossing points, that provides good estimations in all scenarios with no need of pre-labeling. The segmentation approach is time-consuming as the estimation of the densities is performed after locating the crossing points. In this novel proposal, we avoid this step by computing the density of threads directly from the image with a regression deep learning model. We also incorporate some improvements in the initial preprocessing of the input image with an impact on the final error. Several models are proposed and analyzed to retain the best one. Furthermore, we further reduce the density estimation error by introducing a semi-supervised approach.

To improve the cluster quality, we train a speaker embedding network dedicated for clustering by minimizing the contrastive center loss. The goal is to reduce the distance between an embedding and its assigned cluster center while enlarging the distance between the embedding and the other cluster centers. Using VoxCeleb2 as the source domain and CN-Celeb1 as the target domain, we demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve an equal error rate (EER) of 8.10% on the CN-Celeb1 evaluation set without using any labels from the target domain.

{"title":"Unified Keypoint-based Action Recognition Framework via Structured Keypoint Pooling","abstract":"This paper simultaneously addresses three limitations associated with conventional skeleton-based action recognition; skeleton detection and tracking errors, poor variety of the targeted actions, as well as person-wise and frame-wise action recognition. A point cloud deep-learning paradigm is introduced to the action recognition, and a unified framework along with a novel deep neural network architecture called Structured Keypoint Pooling is proposed. The proposed method sparsely aggregates keypoint features in a cascaded manner based on prior knowledge of the data structure (which is inherent in skeletons), such as the instances and frames to which each keypoint belongs, and achieves robustness against input errors. Its less constrained and tracking-free architecture enables time-series keypoints consisting of human skeletons and nonhuman object contours to be efficiently treated as an input 3D point cloud and extends the variety of the targeted action. Furthermore, we propose a Pooling-Switching Trick inspired by Structured Keypoint Pooling. This trick switches the pooling kernels between the training and inference phases to detect person-wise and frame-wise actions in a weakly supervised manner using only video-level action labels. This trick enables our training scheme to naturally introduce novel data augmentation, which mixes multiple point clouds extracted from different videos. In the experiments, we comprehensively verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against the limitations, and the method outperforms state-of-the-art skeleton-based action recognition and spatio-temporal action localization methods.","created":"2023-03-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15270v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Our method is inspired by desirable properties of features in representation learning: high inter-class dispersion and high intra-class compactness. Our analysis shows that inter-class dispersion is strongly correlated with the model accuracy, while intra-class compactness does not reflect the generalization performance on OOD data.

{"title":"Adaptive Bi-Recommendation and Self-Improving Network for Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation-Assisted IoT Intrusion Detection","abstract":"As Internet of Things devices become prevalent, using intrusion detection to protect IoT from malicious intrusions is of vital importance. However, the data scarcity of IoT hinders the effectiveness of traditional intrusion detection methods. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose the Adaptive Bi-Recommendation and Self-Improving Network (ABRSI) based on unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA). The ABRSI transfers enrich intrusion knowledge from a data-rich network intrusion source domain to facilitate effective intrusion detection for data-scarce IoT target domains. The ABRSI achieves fine-grained intrusion knowledge transfer via adaptive bi-recommendation matching. Matching the bi-recommendation interests of two recommender systems and the alignment of intrusion categories in the shared feature space form a mutual-benefit loop. Besides, the ABRSI uses a self-improving mechanism, autonomously improving the intrusion knowledge transfer from four ways. A hard pseudo label voting mechanism jointly considers recommender system decision and label relationship information to promote more accurate hard pseudo label assignment. To promote diversity and target data participation during intrusion knowledge transfer, target instances failing to be assigned with a hard pseudo label will be assigned with a probabilistic soft pseudo label, forming a hybrid pseudo-labelling strategy. Meanwhile, the ABRSI also makes soft pseudo-labels globally diverse and individually certain. Finally, an error knowledge learning mechanism is utilised to adversarially exploit factors that causes detection ambiguity and learns through both current and previous error knowledge, preventing error knowledge forgetfulness. Holistically, these mechanisms form the ABRSI model that boosts IoT intrusion detection accuracy via HDA-assisted intrusion knowledge transfer.","created":"2023-03-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14317v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Despite several domain adaptation methods, achieving high-precision results remains an issue. False-positive error propagation is still observed in methods using the well-established student-teacher framework, particularly for small-scale and low-light objects. This paper proposes a two-phase consistency unsupervised domain adaptation network, 2PCNet, to address these issues. The network employs high-confidence bounding-box predictions from the teacher in the first phase and appends them to the student's region proposals for the teacher to re-evaluate in the second phase, resulting in a combination of high and low confidence pseudo-labels. The night images and pseudo-labels are scaled-down before being used as input to the student, providing stronger small-scale pseudo-labels. To address errors that arise from low-light regions and other night-related attributes in images, we propose a night-specific augmentation pipeline called NightAug.

However, GEPs often utilize disparate mechanisms (e.g., regressors, thresholding functions, calibration datasets, etc), to derive such error estimates, which can obfuscate the benefits of a particular scoring function. Therefore, in this work, we rigorously study the effectiveness of popular scoring functions (confidence, local manifold smoothness, model agreement), independent of mechanism choice. We find, absent complex mechanisms, that state-of-the-art confidence- and smoothness- based scores fail to outperform simple model-agreement scores when estimating error under distribution shifts and corruptions. Furthermore, on realistic settings where the training data has been compromised (e.g., label noise, measurement noise, undersampling), we find that model-agreement scores continue to perform well and that ensemble diversity is important for improving its performance. Finally, to better understand the limitations of scoring functions, we demonstrate that simplicity bias, or the propensity of deep neural networks to rely upon simple but brittle features, can adversely affect GEP performance. Overall, our work carefully studies the effectiveness of popular scoring functions in realistic settings and helps to better understand their limitations.","created":"2023-03-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13589v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Semantic Image Attack for Visual Model Diagnosis","abstract":"In practice, metric analysis on a specific train and test dataset does not guarantee reliable or fair ML models. This is partially due to the fact that obtaining a balanced, diverse, and perfectly labeled dataset is typically expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone. Rather than relying on a carefully designed test set to assess ML models' failures, fairness, or robustness, this paper proposes Semantic Image Attack (SIA), a method based on the adversarial attack that provides semantic adversarial images to allow model diagnosis, interpretability, and robustness. Traditional adversarial training is a popular methodology for robustifying ML models against attacks. However, existing adversarial methods do not combine the two aspects that enable the interpretation and analysis of the model's flaws: semantic traceability and perceptual quality. SIA combines the two features via iterative gradient ascent on a predefined semantic attribute space and the image space. We illustrate the validity of our approach in three scenarios for keypoint detection and classification. (1) Model diagnosis: SIA generates a histogram of attributes that highlights the semantic vulnerability of the ML model (i.e., attributes that make the model fail). (2) Stronger attacks: SIA generates adversarial examples with visually interpretable attributes that lead to higher attack success rates than baseline methods. The adversarial training on SIA improves the transferable robustness across different gradient-based attacks. (3) Robustness to imbalanced datasets: we use SIA to augment the underrepresented classes, which outperforms strong augmentation and re-balancing baselines.","created":"2023-03-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13010v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, mitigating risks arising from human error and uncertainty within such human-AI interactions is an important and understudied issue. In this work, we study human uncertainty in the context of concept-based models, a family of AI systems that enable human feedback via concept interventions where an expert intervenes on human-interpretable concepts relevant to the task. Prior work in this space often assumes that humans are oracles who are always certain and correct. Yet, real-world decision-making by humans is prone to occasional mistakes and uncertainty. We study how existing concept-based models deal with uncertain interventions from humans using two novel datasets: UMNIST, a visual dataset with controlled simulated uncertainty based on the MNIST dataset, and CUB-S, a relabeling of the popular CUB concept dataset with rich, densely-annotated soft labels from humans. We show that training with uncertain concept labels may help mitigate weaknesses of concept-based systems when handling uncertain interventions. These results allow us to identify several open challenges, which we argue can be tackled through future multidisciplinary research on building interactive uncertainty-aware systems.

{"title":"MaskCon: Masked Contrastive Learning for Coarse-Labelled Dataset","abstract":"Deep learning has achieved great success in recent years with the aid of advanced neural network structures and large-scale human-annotated datasets. However, it is often costly and difficult to accurately and efficiently annotate large-scale datasets, especially for some specialized domains where fine-grained labels are required. In this setting, coarse labels are much easier to acquire as they do not require expert knowledge. In this work, we propose a contrastive learning method, called $\\textbf{Mask}$ed $\\textbf{Con}$trastive learning~($\\textbf{MaskCon}$) to address the under-explored problem setting, where we learn with a coarse-labelled dataset in order to address a finer labelling problem. More specifically, within the contrastive learning framework, for each sample our method generates soft-labels with the aid of coarse labels against other samples and another augmented view of the sample in question. By contrast to self-supervised contrastive learning where only the sample's augmentations are considered hard positives, and in supervised contrastive learning where only samples with the same coarse labels are considered hard positives, we propose soft labels based on sample distances, that are masked by the coarse labels. This allows us to utilize both inter-sample relations and coarse labels. We demonstrate that our method can obtain as special cases many existing state-of-the-art works and that it provides tighter bounds on the generalization error. Experimentally, our method achieves significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art in various datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet-1K, Standford Online Products and Stanford Cars196 datasets.

{"title":"Autofluorescence Bronchoscopy Video Analysis for Lesion Frame Detection","abstract":"Because of the significance of bronchial lesions as indicators of early lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma, a critical need exists for early detection of bronchial lesions. Autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB) is a primary modality used for bronchial lesion detection, as it shows high sensitivity to suspicious lesions. The physician, however, must interactively browse a long video stream to locate lesions, making the search exceedingly tedious and error prone. Unfortunately, limited research has explored the use of automated AFB video analysis for efficient lesion detection. We propose a robust automatic AFB analysis approach that distinguishes informative and uninformative AFB video frames in a video. In addition, for the informative frames, we determine the frames containing potential lesions and delineate candidate lesion regions. Our approach draws upon a combination of computer-based image analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. Thus, the analysis of an AFB video stream becomes more tractable. Tests with patient AFB video indicate that $\\ge$97\\% of frames were correctly labeled as informative or uninformative. In addition, $\\ge$97\\% of lesion frames were correctly identified, with false positive and false negative rates $\\le$3\\%.","created":"2023-03-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12198v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Boosting Verified Training for Robust Image Classifications via Abstraction","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel, abstraction-based, certified training method for robust image classifiers. Via abstraction, all perturbed images are mapped into intervals before feeding into neural networks for training. By training on intervals, all the perturbed images that are mapped to the same interval are classified as the same label, rendering the variance of training sets to be small and the loss landscape of the models to be smooth. Consequently, our approach significantly improves the robustness of trained models. For the abstraction, our training method also enables a sound and complete black-box verification approach, which is orthogonal and scalable to arbitrary types of neural networks regardless of their sizes and architectures. We evaluate our method on a wide range of benchmarks in different scales. The experimental results show that our method outperforms state of the art by (i) reducing the verified errors of trained models up to 95.64%; (ii) totally achieving up to 602.50x speedup; and (iii) scaling up to larger models with up to 138 million trainable parameters.

{"title":"Learning Optical Flow from Event Camera with Rendered Dataset","abstract":"We study the problem of estimating optical flow from event cameras. One important issue is how to build a high-quality event-flow dataset with accurate event values and flow labels. Previous datasets are created by either capturing real scenes by event cameras or synthesizing from images with pasted foreground objects. The former case can produce real event values but with calculated flow labels, which are sparse and inaccurate. The later case can generate dense flow labels but the interpolated events are prone to errors. In this work, we propose to render a physically correct event-flow dataset using computer graphics models. In particular, we first create indoor and outdoor 3D scenes by Blender with rich scene content variations. Second, diverse camera motions are included for the virtual capturing, producing images and accurate flow labels. Third, we render high-framerate videos between images for accurate events. The rendered dataset can adjust the density of events, based on which we further introduce an adaptive density module (ADM). Experiments show that our proposed dataset can facilitate event-flow learning, whereas previous approaches when trained on our dataset can improve their performances constantly by a relatively large margin. In addition, event-flow pipelines when equipped with our ADM can further improve performances.","created":"2023-03-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11011v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Deep Learning-Based Detection of Motion-Affected k-Space Lines for T2*-Weighted MRI","abstract":"T2*-weighted gradient echo MR imaging is strongly impacted by subject head motion due to motion-related changes in B0 inhomogeneities. Within the oxygenation-sensitive mqBOLD protocol, even mild motion during the acquisition of the T2*-weighted data propagates into errors in derived quantitative parameter maps. In order to correct these images without the need of repeated measurements, we propose to learn a classification of motion-affected k-space lines. To test this, we perform realistic motion simulations including motion-induced field inhomogeneity changes for supervised training. To detect the presence of motion in each phase encoding line, we train a convolutional neural network, leveraging the multi-echo information of the T2*-weighted images. The proposed network accurately detects motion-affected k-space lines for simulated displacements of $\\geq$ 0.5mm (accuracy on test set: 92.5%). Finally, we show example reconstructions where we include these classification labels as weights in the data consistency term of an iterative reconstruction procedure, opening up exciting opportunities of k-space line detection in combination with more powerful reconstruction methods.","created":"2023-03-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10987v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"ERSAM: Neural Architecture Search For Energy-Efficient and Real-Time Social Ambiance Measurement","abstract":"Social ambiance describes the context in which social interactions happen, and can be measured using speech audio by counting the number of concurrent speakers. This measurement has enabled various mental health tracking and human-centric IoT applications. While on-device Socal Ambiance Measure (SAM) is highly desirable to ensure user privacy and thus facilitate wide adoption of the aforementioned applications, the required computational complexity of state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) powered SAM solutions stands at odds with the often constrained resources on mobile devices. Furthermore, only limited labeled data is available or practical when it comes to SAM under clinical settings due to various privacy constraints and the required human effort, further challenging the achievable accuracy of on-device SAM solutions. To this end, we propose a dedicated neural architecture search framework for Energy-efficient and Real-time SAM (ERSAM). Specifically, our ERSAM framework can automatically search for DNNs that push forward the achievable accuracy vs. hardware efficiency frontier of mobile SAM solutions. For example, ERSAM-delivered DNNs only consume 40 mW x 12 h energy and 0.05 seconds processing latency for a 5 seconds audio segment on a Pixel 3 phone, while only achieving an error rate of 14.3% on a social ambiance dataset generated by LibriSpeech. We can expect that our ERSAM framework can pave the way for ubiquitous on-device SAM solutions which are in growing demand.","created":"2023-03-19","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10727v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Wheat Head Counting by Estimating a Density Map with Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"Wheat is one of the most significant crop species with an annual worldwide grain production of 700 million tonnes. Assessing the production of wheat spikes can help us measure the grain production. Thus, detecting and characterizing spikes from images of wheat fields is an essential component in a wheat breeding process. In this study, we propose three wheat head counting networks (WHCNet\\_1, WHCNet\\_2 and WHCNet\\_3) to accurately estimate the wheat head count from an individual image and construct high quality density map, which illustrates the distribution of wheat heads in the image. The WHCNets are composed of two major components: a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the front-end for wheat head image feature extraction and a CNN with skip connections for the back-end to generate high-quality density maps. The dataset used in this study is the Global Wheat Head Detection (GWHD) dataset, which is a large, diverse, and well-labelled dataset of wheat images and built by a joint international collaborative effort. We compare our methods with CSRNet, a deep learning method which developed for highly congested scenes understanding and performing accurate count estimation as well as presenting high quality density maps. By taking the advantage of the skip connections between CNN layers, WHCNets integrate features from low CNN layers to high CNN layers, thus, the output density maps have both high spatial resolution and detailed representations of the input images. The experiments showed that our methods outperformed CSRNet in terms of the evaluation metrics, mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) with smaller model sizes.

{"title":"Confidence Attention and Generalization Enhanced Distillation for Continuous Video Domain Adaptation","abstract":"Continuous Video Domain Adaptation (CVDA) is a scenario where a source model is required to adapt to a series of individually available changing target domains continuously without source data or target supervision. It has wide applications, such as robotic vision and autonomous driving. The main underlying challenge of CVDA is to learn helpful information only from the unsupervised target data while avoiding forgetting previously learned knowledge catastrophically, which is out of the capability of previous Video-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation methods. Therefore, we propose a Confidence-Attentive network with geneRalization enhanced self-knowledge disTillation (CART) to address the challenge in CVDA. Firstly, to learn from unsupervised domains, we propose to learn from pseudo labels. However, in continuous adaptation, prediction errors can accumulate rapidly in pseudo labels, and CART effectively tackles this problem with two key modules. Specifically, The first module generates refined pseudo labels using model predictions and deploys a novel attentive learning strategy. The second module compares the outputs of augmented data from the current model to the outputs of weakly augmented data from the source model, forming a novel consistency regularization on the model to alleviate the accumulation of prediction errors. Extensive experiments suggest that the CVDA performance of CART outperforms existing methods by a considerable margin.","created":"2023-03-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10452v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"LossMix: Simplify and Generalize Mixup for Object Detection and Beyond","abstract":"The success of data mixing augmentations in image classification tasks has been well-received. However, these techniques cannot be readily applied to object detection due to challenges such as spatial misalignment, foreground/background distinction, and plurality of instances. To tackle these issues, we first introduce a novel conceptual framework called Supervision Interpolation, which offers a fresh perspective on interpolation-based augmentations by relaxing and generalizing Mixup. Building on this framework, we propose LossMix, a simple yet versatile and effective regularization that enhances the performance and robustness of object detectors and more. Our key insight is that we can effectively regularize the training on mixed data by interpolating their loss errors instead of ground truth labels. Empirical results on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that LossMix consistently outperforms currently popular mixing strategies. Furthermore, we design a two-stage domain mixing method that leverages LossMix to surpass Adaptive Teacher (CVPR 2022) and set a new state of the art for unsupervised domain adaptation.","created":"2023-03-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10343v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

The advancement of these AI systems is inseparable from open-source software (OSS). This paper presents an empirical study that investigates the issues in the repositories of open-source AI repositories to assist developers in understanding problems during the process of employing AI systems. We collect 576 repositories from the PapersWithCode platform. Among these repositories, we find 24,953 issues by utilizing GitHub REST APIs. Our empirical study includes three phases. First, we manually analyze these issues to categorize the problems that developers are likely to encounter in open-source AI repositories. Specifically, we provide a taxonomy of 13 categories related to AI systems. The two most common issues are runtime errors (23.18%) and unclear instructions (19.53%). Second, we see that 67.5% of issues are closed. We also find that half of these issues resolve within four days. Moreover, issue management features, e.g., label and assign, are not widely adopted in open-source AI repositories. In particular, only 7.81% and 5.9% of repositories label issues and assign these issues to assignees, respectively. Finally, we empirically show that employing GitHub issue management features and writing issues with detailed descriptions facilitate the resolution of issues. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for developers to help better manage the issues of open-source AI repositories and improve their quality.","created":"2023-03-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09795v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Tackling Clutter in Radar Data -- Label Generation and Detection Using PointNet++","abstract":"Radar sensors employed for environment perception, e.g. in autonomous vehicles, output a lot of unwanted clutter. These points, for which no corresponding real objects exist, are a major source of errors in following processing steps like object detection or tracking. We therefore present two novel neural network setups for identifying clutter. The input data, network architectures and training configuration are adjusted specifically for this task. Special attention is paid to the downsampling of point clouds composed of multiple sensor scans. In an extensive evaluation, the new setups display substantially better performance than existing approaches. Because there is no suitable public data set in which clutter is annotated, we design a method to automatically generate the respective labels. By applying it to existing data with object annotations and releasing its code, we effectively create the first freely available radar clutter data set representing real-world driving scenarios.

{"title":"The Scope of In-Context Learning for the Extraction of Medical Temporal Constraints","abstract":"Medications often impose temporal constraints on everyday patient activity. Violations of such medical temporal constraints (MTCs) lead to a lack of treatment adherence, in addition to poor health outcomes and increased healthcare expenses. These MTCs are found in drug usage guidelines (DUGs) in both patient education materials and clinical texts. Computationally representing MTCs in DUGs will advance patient-centric healthcare applications by helping to define safe patient activity patterns. We define a novel taxonomy of MTCs found in DUGs and develop a novel context-free grammar (CFG) based model to computationally represent MTCs from unstructured DUGs. Additionally, we release three new datasets with a combined total of N = 836 DUGs labeled with normalized MTCs. We develop an in-context learning (ICL) solution for automatically extracting and normalizing MTCs found in DUGs, achieving an average F1 score of 0.62 across all datasets. Finally, we rigorously investigate ICL model performance against a baseline model, across datasets and MTC types, and through in-depth error analysis.","created":"2023-03-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09366v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Unsupervised domain adaptation by learning using privileged information","abstract":"Successful unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is guaranteed only under strong assumptions such as covariate shift and overlap between input domains. The latter is often violated in high-dimensional applications such as image classification which, despite this challenge, continues to serve as inspiration and benchmark for algorithm development. In this work, we show that access to side information about examples from the source and target domains can help relax these assumptions and increase sample efficiency in learning, at the cost of collecting a richer variable set. We call this domain adaptation by learning using privileged information (DALUPI). Tailored for this task, we propose a simple two-stage learning algorithm inspired by our analysis and a practical end-to-end algorithm for multi-label image classification. In a suite of experiments, including an application to medical image analysis, we demonstrate that incorporating privileged information in learning can reduce errors in domain transfer compared to classical learning.","created":"2023-03-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09350v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Rethinking Optical Flow from Geometric Matching Consistent Perspective","abstract":"Optical flow estimation is a challenging problem remaining unsolved. Recent deep learning based optical flow models have achieved considerable success. However, these models often train networks from the scratch on standard optical flow data, which restricts their ability to robustly and geometrically match image features. In this paper, we propose a rethinking to previous optical flow estimation. We particularly leverage Geometric Image Matching (GIM) as a pre-training task for the optical flow estimation (MatchFlow) with better feature representations, as GIM shares some common challenges as optical flow estimation, and with massive labeled real-world data. Thus, matching static scenes helps to learn more fundamental feature correlations of objects and scenes with consistent displacements. Specifically, the proposed MatchFlow model employs a QuadTree attention-based network pre-trained on MegaDepth to extract coarse features for further flow regression. Extensive experiments show that our model has great cross-dataset generalization. Our method achieves 11.5% and 10.1% error reduction from GMA on Sintel clean pass and KITTI test set.

{"title":"Exploring Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation Ensembles for Medical Imaging Systems","abstract":"Reliable classification and detection of certain medical conditions, in images, with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks, require vast amounts of pixel-wise annotation. However, the public availability of such datasets is minimal. Therefore, semantic segmentation with image-level labels presents a promising alternative to this problem. Nevertheless, very few works have focused on evaluating this technique and its applicability to the medical sector. Due to their complexity and the small number of training examples in medical datasets, classifier-based weakly supervised networks like class activation maps (CAMs) struggle to extract useful information from them. However, most state-of-the-art approaches rely on them to achieve their improvements. Therefore, we propose a framework that can still utilize the low-quality CAM predictions of complicated datasets to improve the accuracy of our results. Our framework achieves that by first utilizing lower threshold CAMs to cover the target object with high certainty; second, by combining multiple low-threshold CAMs that even out their errors while highlighting the target object. We performed exhaustive experiments on the popular multi-modal BRATS and prostate DECATHLON segmentation challenge datasets. Using the proposed framework, we have demonstrated an improved dice score of up to 8% on BRATS and 6% on DECATHLON datasets compared to the previous state-of-the-art.","created":"2023-03-14","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07896v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"On the Implicit Geometry of Cross-Entropy Parameterizations for Label-Imbalanced Data","abstract":"Various logit-adjusted parameterizations of the cross-entropy (CE) loss have been proposed as alternatives to weighted CE for training large models on label-imbalanced data far beyond the zero train error regime. The driving force behind those designs has been the theory of implicit bias, which for linear(ized) models, explains why they successfully induce bias on the optimization path towards solutions that favor minorities. Aiming to extend this theory to non-linear models, we investigate the implicit geometry of classifiers and embeddings that are learned by different CE parameterizations. Our main result characterizes the global minimizers of a non-convex cost-sensitive SVM classifier for the unconstrained features model, which serves as an abstraction of deep nets. We derive closed-form formulas for the angles and norms of classifiers and embeddings as a function of the number of classes, the imbalance and the minority ratios, and the loss hyperparameters. Using these, we show that logit-adjusted parameterizations can be appropriately tuned to learn symmetric geometries irrespective of the imbalance ratio.

Errors can be easily introduced during annotation and overlooked during review, yielding inaccurate benchmarks and performance degradation of deep neural networks trained on noisy labels. In this work, we for the first time introduce a benchmark for label error detection methods on object detection datasets as well as a label error detection method and a number of baselines. We simulate four different types of randomly introduced label errors on train and test sets of well-labeled object detection datasets. For our label error detection method we assume a two-stage object detector to be given and consider the sum of both stages' classification and regression losses. The losses are computed with respect to the predictions and the noisy labels including simulated label errors, aiming at detecting the latter. We compare our method to three baselines: a naive one without deep learning, the object detector's score and the entropy of the classification softmax distribution. We outperform all baselines and demonstrate that among the considered methods, ours is the only one that detects label errors of all four types efficiently. Furthermore, we detect real label errors a) on commonly used test datasets in object detection and b) on a proprietary dataset. In both cases we achieve low false positives rates, i.e., when considering 200 proposals from our method, we detect label errors with a precision for a) of up to 71.5% and for b) with 97%.","created":"2023-03-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06999v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Context-Aware Selective Label Smoothing for Calibrating Sequence Recognition Model","abstract":"Despite the success of deep neural network (DNN) on sequential data (i.e., scene text and speech) recognition, it suffers from the over-confidence problem mainly due to overfitting in training with the cross-entropy loss, which may make the decision-making less reliable. Confidence calibration has been recently proposed as one effective solution to this problem. Nevertheless, the majority of existing confidence calibration methods aims at non-sequential data, which is limited if directly applied to sequential data since the intrinsic contextual dependency in sequences or the class-specific statistical prior is seldom exploited. To the end, we propose a Context-Aware Selective Label Smoothing (CASLS) method for calibrating sequential data. The proposed CASLS fully leverages the contextual dependency in sequences to construct confusion matrices of contextual prediction statistics over different classes. Class-specific error rates are then used to adjust the weights of smoothing strength in order to achieve adaptive calibration. Experimental results on sequence recognition tasks, including scene text recognition and speech recognition, demonstrate that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance.","created":"2023-03-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06946v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Informative regularization for a multi-layer perceptron RR Lyrae classifier under data shift","abstract":"In recent decades, machine learning has provided valuable models and algorithms for processing and extracting knowledge from time-series surveys. Different classifiers have been proposed and performed to an excellent standard. Nevertheless, few papers have tackled the data shift problem in labeled training sets, which occurs when there is a mismatch between the data distribution in the training set and the testing set. This drawback can damage the prediction performance in unseen data. Consequently, we propose a scalable and easily adaptable approach based on an informative regularization and an ad-hoc training procedure to mitigate the shift problem during the training of a multi-layer perceptron for RR Lyrae classification. We collect ranges for characteristic features to construct a symbolic representation of prior knowledge, which was used to model the informative regularizer component. Simultaneously, we design a two-step back-propagation algorithm to integrate this knowledge into the neural network, whereby one step is applied in each epoch to minimize classification error, while another is applied to ensure regularization. Our algorithm defines a subset of parameters (a mask) for each loss function. This approach handles the forgetting effect, which stems from a trade-off between these loss functions (learning from data versus learning expert knowledge) during training. Experiments were conducted using recently proposed shifted benchmark sets for RR Lyrae stars, outperforming baseline models by up to 3\\% through a more reliable classifier. Our method provides a new path to incorporate knowledge from characteristic features into artificial neural networks to manage the underlying data shift problem.","created":"2023-03-12","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06544v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Due to the nature of RNN-T alignments, applying soft distillation between RNN-T architectures having different posterior distributions is challenging. In addition, bad teachers having high word-error-rate (WER) reduce the efficacy of KD. We investigate how to effectively distill knowledge from variable quality ASR teachers, which has not been studied before to the best of our knowledge.

The applications considered in this work are the automated detection of FHB disease symptoms expressed on a wheat plant, the automated estimation of the total number of spikelets and the total number of infected spikelets on a wheat head, and the automated assessment of the FHB severity in infected wheat. The data used to generate the results are 3-dimensional (3D) multispectral point clouds (PC), which are 3D collections of points - each associated with a red, green, blue (RGB), and near-infrared (NIR) measurement. Over 300 wheat plant images were collected using a multispectral 3D scanner, and the labelled UW-MRDC 3D wheat dataset was created. The data was used to develop novel and efficient 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) models for FHB detection, which achieved 100% accuracy.

However, excessive class separation can bring to overfitting since good generalisation requires learning invariant features, which involve some level of entanglement. We report on numerical experiments showing how the optimisation dynamics finds representations that balance these opposing tendencies with a non-monotonic trend. After a fast segregation phase, a slower rearrangement (conserved across data sets and architectures) increases the class entanglement. The training error at the inversion is remarkably stable under subsampling, and across network initialisations and optimisers, which characterises it as a property solely of the data structure and (very weakly) of the architecture. The inversion is the manifestation of tradeoffs elicited by well-defined and maximally stable elements of the training set, coined \"stragglers\", particularly influential for generalisation.","created":"2023-03-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05161v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this paper, we provide an alternate proof of Gaussianity of the pretty good measurement for a Gaussian ensemble of multimode bosonic states, with a focus on providing an explicit and efficiently computable Gaussian description of the measurement. These findings imply that the pretty good measurement is no longer merely an analytical tool for this case, but that it can also be implemented experimentally in quantum optics laboratories. We also compute an explicit form of the mean square error of the pretty good measurement, which is relevant when using it for parameter estimation.","created":"2023-03-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04949v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"The Bystander Affect Detection (BAD) Dataset for Failure Detection in HRI","abstract":"For a robot to repair its own error, it must first know it has made a mistake. One way that people detect errors is from the implicit reactions from bystanders -- their confusion, smirks, or giggles clue us in that something unexpected occurred. To enable robots to detect and act on bystander responses to task failures, we developed a novel method to elicit bystander responses to human and robot errors. Using 46 different stimulus videos featuring a variety of human and machine task failures, we collected a total of 2452 webcam videos of human reactions from 54 participants. To test the viability of the collected data, we used the bystander reaction dataset as input to a deep-learning model, BADNet, to predict failure occurrence. We tested different data labeling methods and learned how they affect model performance, achieving precisions above 90%. We discuss strategies to model bystander reactions and predict failure and how this approach can be used in real-world robotic deployments to detect errors and improve robot performance. As part of this work, we also contribute with the \"Bystander Affect Detection\" (BAD) dataset of bystander reactions, supporting the development of better prediction models.","created":"2023-03-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04835v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"A Deep-Learning-Based Neural Decoding Framework for Emotional Brain-Computer Interfaces","abstract":"Reading emotions precisely from segments of neural activity is crucial for the development of emotional brain-computer interfaces. Among all neural decoding algorithms, deep learning (DL) holds the potential to become the most promising one, yet progress has been limited in recent years. One possible reason is that the efficacy of DL strongly relies on training samples, yet the neural data used for training are often from non-human primates and mixed with plenty of noise, which in turn mislead the training of DL models. Given it is difficult to accurately determine animals' emotions from humans' perspective, we assume the dominant noise in neural data representing different emotions is the labeling error. Here, we report the development and application of a neural decoding framework called Emo-Net that consists of a confidence learning (CL) component and a DL component. The framework is fully data-driven and is capable of decoding emotions from multiple datasets obtained from behaving monkeys. In addition to improving the decoding ability, Emo-Net significantly improves the performance of the base DL models, making emotion recognition in animal models possible. In summary, this framework may inspire novel understandings of the neural basis of emotion and drive the realization of close-loop emotional brain-computer interfaces.","created":"2023-03-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04391v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"TOLD: A Novel Two-Stage Overlap-Aware Framework for Speaker Diarization","abstract":"Recently, end-to-end neural diarization (EEND) is introduced and achieves promising results in speaker-overlapped scenarios. In EEND, speaker diarization is formulated as a multi-label prediction problem, where speaker activities are estimated independently and their dependency are not well considered. To overcome these disadvantages, we employ the power set encoding to reformulate speaker diarization as a single-label classification problem and propose the overlap-aware EEND (EEND-OLA) model, in which speaker overlaps and dependency can be modeled explicitly. Inspired by the success of two-stage hybrid systems, we further propose a novel Two-stage OverLap-aware Diarization framework (TOLD) by involving a speaker overlap-aware post-processing (SOAP) model to iteratively refine the diarization results of EEND-OLA. Experimental results show that, compared with the original EEND, the proposed EEND-OLA achieves a 14.39% relative improvement in terms of diarization error rates (DER), and utilizing SOAP provides another 19.33% relative improvement. As a result, our method TOLD achieves a DER of 10.14% on the CALLHOME dataset, which is a new state-of-the-art result on this benchmark to the best of our knowledge.","created":"2023-03-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05397v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"PRIMO: Private Regression in Multiple Outcomes","abstract":"We introduce a new differentially private regression setting we call Private Regression in Multiple Outcomes (PRIMO), inspired the common situation where a data analyst wants to perform a set of $l$ regressions while preserving privacy, where the covariates $X$ are shared across all $l$ regressions, and each regression $i \\in [l]$ has a different vector of outcomes $y_i$. While naively applying private linear regression techniques $l$ times leads to a $\\sqrt{l}$ multiplicative increase in error over the standard linear regression setting, in Subsection $4.1$ we modify techniques based on sufficient statistics perturbation (SSP) to yield greatly improved dependence on $l$. In Subsection $4.2$ we prove an equivalence to the problem of privately releasing the answers to a special class of low-sensitivity queries we call inner product queries. Via this equivalence, we adapt the geometric projection-based methods from prior work on private query release to the PRIMO setting. Under the assumption the labels $Y$ are public, the projection gives improved results over the Gaussian mechanism when $n < l\\sqrt{d}$, with no asymptotic dependence on $l$ in the error. In Subsection $4.3$ we study the complexity of our projection algorithm, and analyze a faster sub-sampling based variant in Subsection $4.4$. Finally in Section $5$ we apply our algorithms to the task of private genomic risk prediction for multiple phenotypes using data from the 1000 Genomes project. We find that for moderately large values of $l$ our techniques drastically improve the accuracy relative to both the naive baseline that uses existing private regression methods and our modified SSP algorithm that doesn't use the projection.","created":"2023-03-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04195v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Deep Age-Invariant Fingerprint Segmentation System","abstract":"Fingerprint-based identification systems achieve higher accuracy when a slap containing multiple fingerprints of a subject is used instead of a single fingerprint. However, segmenting or auto-localizing all fingerprints in a slap image is a challenging task due to the different orientations of fingerprints, noisy backgrounds, and the smaller size of fingertip components. The presence of slap images in a real-world dataset where one or more fingerprints are rotated makes it challenging for a biometric recognition system to localize and label the fingerprints automatically. Improper fingerprint localization and finger labeling errors lead to poor matching performance. In this paper, we introduce a method to generate arbitrary angled bounding boxes using a deep learning-based algorithm that precisely localizes and labels fingerprints from both axis-aligned and over-rotated slap images. We built a fingerprint segmentation model named CRFSEG (Clarkson Rotated Fingerprint segmentation Model) by updating the previously proposed CFSEG model which was based on traditional Faster R-CNN architecture [21]. CRFSEG improves upon the Faster R-CNN algorithm with arbitrarily angled bounding boxes that allow the CRFSEG to perform better in challenging slap images. After training the CRFSEG algorithm on a new dataset containing slap images collected from both adult and children subjects, our results suggest that the CRFSEG model was invariant across different age groups and can handle over-rotated slap images successfully. In the Combined dataset containing both normal and rotated images of adult and children subjects, we achieved a matching accuracy of 97.17%, which outperformed state-of-the-art VeriFinger (94.25%) and NFSEG segmentation systems (80.58%).","created":"2023-03-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03341v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Learning Label Encodings for Deep Regression","abstract":"Deep regression networks are widely used to tackle the problem of predicting a continuous value for a given input. Task-specialized approaches for training regression networks have shown significant improvement over generic approaches, such as direct regression. More recently, a generic approach based on regression by binary classification using binary-encoded labels has shown significant improvement over direct regression. The space of label encodings for regression is large. Lacking heretofore have been automated approaches to find a good label encoding for a given application. This paper introduces Regularized Label Encoding Learning (RLEL) for end-to-end training of an entire network and its label encoding. RLEL provides a generic approach for tackling regression. Underlying RLEL is our observation that the search space of label encodings can be constrained and efficiently explored by using a continuous search space of real-valued label encodings combined with a regularization function designed to encourage encodings with certain properties. These properties balance the probability of classification error in individual bits against error correction capability. Label encodings found by RLEL result in lower or comparable errors to manually designed label encodings. Applying RLEL results in 10.9% and 12.4% improvement in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over direct regression and multiclass classification, respectively. Our evaluation demonstrates that RLEL can be combined with off-the-shelf feature extractors and is suitable across different architectures, datasets, and tasks.

{"title":"Evaluation of Confidence-based Ensembling in Deep Learning Image Classification","abstract":"Ensembling is a successful technique to improve the performance of machine learning (ML) models.   Conf-Ensemble is an adaptation to Boosting to create ensembles based on model confidence instead of model errors to better classify difficult edge-cases. The key idea is to create successive model experts for samples that were difficult (not necessarily incorrectly classified) by the preceding model. This technique has been shown to provide better results than boosting in binary-classification with a small feature space (~80 features).   In this paper, we evaluate the Conf-Ensemble approach in the much more complex task of image classification with the ImageNet dataset (224x224x3 features with 1000 classes). Image classification is an important benchmark for AI-based perception and thus it helps to assess if this method can be used in safety-critical applications using ML ensembles.   Our experiments indicate that in a complex multi-label classification task, the expected benefit of specialization on complex input samples cannot be achieved with a small sample set, i.e., a good classifier seems to rely on very complex feature analysis that cannot be well trained on just a limited subset of \"difficult samples\".   We propose an improvement to Conf-Ensemble to increase the number of samples fed to successive ensemble members, and a three-member Conf-Ensemble using this improvement was able to surpass a single model in accuracy, although the amount is not significant. Our findings shed light on the limits of the approach and the non-triviality of harnessing big data.","created":"2023-03-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03185v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"PLUNDER: Probabilistic Program Synthesis for Learning from Unlabeled and Noisy Demonstrations","abstract":"Learning from demonstration (LfD) is a widely researched paradigm for teaching robots to perform novel tasks. LfD works particularly well with program synthesis since the resulting programmatic policy is data efficient, interpretable, and amenable to formal verification. However, existing synthesis approaches to LfD rely on precise and labeled demonstrations and are incapable of reasoning about the uncertainty inherent in human decision-making. In this paper, we propose PLUNDER, a new LfD approach that integrates a probabilistic program synthesizer in an expectation-maximization (EM) loop to overcome these limitations. PLUNDER only requires unlabeled low-level demonstrations of the intended task (e.g., remote-controlled motion trajectories), which liberates end-users from providing explicit labels and facilitates a more intuitive LfD experience. PLUNDER also generates a probabilistic policy that captures actuation errors and the uncertainties inherent in human decision making. Our experiments compare PLUNDER with state-of the-art LfD techniques and demonstrate its advantages across different robotic tasks.","created":"2023-03-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01440v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this study, to enhance the training effectiveness of SA-EEND models, we propose the use of auxiliary losses for the SA heads of the transformer layers. Specifically, we assume that the attention weight matrices of an SA layer are redundant if their patterns are similar to those of the identity matrix. We then explicitly constrain such matrices to exhibit specific speaker activity patterns relevant to voice activity detection or overlapped speech detection tasks. Consequently, we expect the proposed auxiliary losses to guide the transformer layers to exhibit more diverse patterns in the attention weights, thereby reducing the assumed redundancies in the SA heads. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the simulated and CALLHOME datasets for two-speaker diarization tasks, reducing the diarization error rate of the conventional SA-EEND model by 32.58% and 17.11%, respectively.","created":"2023-03-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01192v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

The idea is to iteratively enhance training data by adding pseudo-labeled data. Its generalization performance heavily depends on the selection of these pseudo-labeled data (PLS). In this paper, we aim at rendering PLS more robust towards the involved modeling assumptions. To this end, we propose to select pseudo-labeled data that maximize a multi-objective utility function. The latter is constructed to account for different sources of uncertainty, three of which we discuss in more detail: model selection, accumulation of errors and covariate shift. In the absence of second-order information on such uncertainties, we furthermore consider the generic approach of the generalized Bayesian alpha-cut updating rule for credal sets. As a practical proof of concept, we spotlight the application of three of our robust extensions on simulated and real-world data. Results suggest that in particular robustness w.r.t. model choice can lead to substantial accuracy gains.","created":"2023-03-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01117v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

These studies also indicate that contours mattered more than textures when pre-training vision transformers. However, the lack of a systematic investigation as to why these contour-oriented synthetic datasets can achieve the same accuracy as real datasets leaves much room for skepticism. In the present work, we develop a novel methodology based on circular harmonics for systematically investigating the design space of contour-oriented synthetic datasets. This allows us to efficiently search the optimal range of FDSL parameters and maximize the variety of synthetic images in the dataset, which we found to be a critical factor. When the resulting new dataset VisualAtom-21k is used for pre-training ViT-Base, the top-1 accuracy reached 83.7% when fine-tuning on ImageNet-1k. This is close to the top-1 accuracy (84.2%) achieved by JFT-300M pre-training, while the number of images is 1/14. Unlike JFT-300M which is a static dataset, the quality of synthetic datasets will continue to improve, and the current work is a testament to this possibility. FDSL is also free of the common issues associated with real images, e.g. privacy/copyright issues, labeling costs/errors, and ethical biases.","created":"2023-03-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01112v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"OliVaR: Improving Olive Variety Recognition using Deep Neural Networks","abstract":"The easy and accurate identification of varieties is fundamental in agriculture, especially in the olive sector, where more than 1200 olive varieties are currently known worldwide. Varietal misidentification leads to many potential problems for all the actors in the sector: farmers and nursery workers may establish the wrong variety, leading to its maladaptation in the field; olive oil and table olive producers may label and sell a non-authentic product; consumers may be misled; and breeders may commit errors during targeted crossings between different varieties. To date, the standard for varietal identification and certification consists of two methods: morphological classification and genetic analysis. The morphological classification consists of the visual pairwise comparison of different organs of the olive tree, where the most important organ is considered to be the endocarp. In contrast, different methods for genetic classification exist (RAPDs, SSR, and SNP). Both classification methods present advantages and disadvantages. Visual morphological classification requires highly specialized personnel and is prone to human error. Genetic identification methods are more accurate but incur a high cost and are difficult to implement. This paper introduces OliVaR, a novel approach to olive varietal identification. OliVaR uses a teacher-student deep learning architecture to learn the defining characteristics of the endocarp of each specific olive variety and perform classification. We construct what is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest olive variety dataset to date, comprising image data for 131 varieties from the Mediterranean basin.

{"title":"An Efficient Tester-Learner for Halfspaces","abstract":"We give the first efficient algorithm for learning halfspaces in the testable learning model recently defined by Rubinfeld and Vasilyan (2023). In this model, a learner certifies that the accuracy of its output hypothesis is near optimal whenever the training set passes an associated test, and training sets drawn from some target distribution -- e.g., the Gaussian -- must pass the test. This model is more challenging than distribution-specific agnostic or Massart noise models where the learner is allowed to fail arbitrarily if the distributional assumption does not hold.   We consider the setting where the target distribution is Gaussian (or more generally any strongly log-concave distribution) in $d$ dimensions and the noise model is either Massart or adversarial (agnostic). For Massart noise, our tester-learner runs in polynomial time and outputs a hypothesis with (information-theoretically optimal) error $\\mathsf{opt} + \\epsilon$ for any strongly log-concave target distribution. For adversarial noise, our tester-learner obtains error $O(\\mathsf{opt}) + \\epsilon$ in polynomial time when the target distribution is Gaussian; for strongly log-concave distributions, we obtain $\\tilde{O}(\\mathsf{opt}) + \\epsilon$ in quasipolynomial time.   Prior work on testable learning ignores the labels in the training set and checks that the empirical moments of the covariates are close to the moments of the base distribution. Here we develop new tests of independent interest that make critical use of the labels and combine them with the moment-matching approach of Gollakota et al. (2023). This enables us to simulate a variant of the algorithm of Diakonikolas et al.

Next, context labels are translated into gesture transcripts using knowledge-based Finite State Machine (FSM) and data-driven Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models. We evaluate the performance of each stage of our method by comparing the results with the ground truth segmentation masks, the consensus context labels, and the gesture labels in the JIGSAWS dataset. Our results show that our segmentation models achieve state-of-the-art performance in recognizing needle and thread in Suturing and we can automatically detect important surgical states with high agreement with crowd-sourced labels (e.g., contact between graspers and objects in Suturing).

{"title":"Inaccurate Label Distribution Learning","abstract":"Label distribution learning (LDL) trains a model to predict the relevance of a set of labels (called label distribution (LD)) to an instance. The previous LDL methods all assumed the LDs of the training instances are accurate. However, annotating highly accurate LDs for training instances is time-consuming and very expensive, and in reality the collected LD is usually inaccurate and disturbed by annotating errors. For the first time, this paper investigates the problem of inaccurate LDL, i.e., developing an LDL model with noisy LDs. Specifically, we assume the noisy LD matrix is the linear combination of an ideal LD matrix and a sparse noisy matrix. Accordingly, inaccurate LDL becomes an inverse problem, i.e., recovering the ideal LD and noise matrix from the inaccurate LDs. To this end, we assume the ideal LD matrix is low-rank due to the correlation of labels. Besides, we use the local geometric structure of instances captured by a graph to assist the ideal LD recovery as if two instances are similar to each other, they are likely to share the same LD. The proposed model is finally formulated as a graph-regularized low-rank and sparse decomposition problem and numerically solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can recover a relatively accurate LD from the inaccurate LD and promote the performance of different LDL methods with inaccurate LD.","created":"2023-02-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13000v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Previous works separately conduct visual grounding to localize the target object, and generate a grasp for that object. However, these works require object labels or visual attributes for grounding, which calls for handcrafted rules in planner and restricts the range of language instructions. In this paper, we propose to jointly model vision, language and action with object-centric representation. Our method is applicable under more flexible language instructions, and not limited by visual grounding error. Besides, by utilizing the powerful priors from the pre-trained multi-modal model and grasp model, sample efficiency is effectively improved and the sim2real problem is relived without additional data for transfer. A series of experiments carried out in simulation and real world indicate that our method can achieve better task success rate by less times of motion under more flexible language instructions.

{"title":"iPlanner: Imperative Path Planning","abstract":"The problem of path planning has been studied for years. Classic planning pipelines, including perception, mapping, and path searching, can result in latency and compounding errors between modules. While recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of end-to-end learning methods in achieving high planning efficiency, these methods often struggle to match the generalization abilities of classic approaches in handling different environments. Moreover, end-to-end training of policies often requires a large number of labeled data or training iterations to reach convergence. In this paper, we present a novel Imperative Learning (IL) approach. This approach leverages a differentiable cost map to provide implicit supervision during policy training, eliminating the need for demonstrations or labeled trajectories. Furthermore, the policy training adopts a Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) process, which combines network update and metric-based trajectory optimization, to generate a smooth and collision-free path toward the goal based on a single depth measurement. The proposed method allows task-level costs of predicted trajectories to be backpropagated through all components to update the network through direct gradient descent. In our experiments, the method demonstrates around 4x faster planning than the classic approach and robustness against localization noise. Additionally, the IL approach enables the planner to generalize to various unseen environments, resulting in an overall 26-87% improvement in SPL performance compared to baseline learning methods.","created":"2023-02-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11434v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Counterfactual Prediction Under Outcome Measurement Error","abstract":"Across domains such as medicine, employment, and criminal justice, predictive models often target labels that imperfectly reflect the outcomes of interest to experts and policymakers. For example, clinical risk assessments deployed to inform physician decision-making often predict measures of healthcare utilization (e.g., costs, hospitalization) as a proxy for patient medical need. These proxies can be subject to outcome measurement error when they systematically differ from the target outcome they are intended to measure. However, prior modeling efforts to characterize and mitigate outcome measurement error overlook the fact that the decision being informed by a model often serves as a risk-mitigating intervention that impacts the target outcome of interest and its recorded proxy. Thus, in these settings, addressing measurement error requires counterfactual modeling of treatment effects on outcomes. In this work, we study intersectional threats to model reliability introduced by outcome measurement error, treatment effects, and selection bias from historical decision-making policies. We develop an unbiased risk minimization method which, given knowledge of proxy measurement error properties, corrects for the combined effects of these challenges. We also develop a method for estimating treatment-dependent measurement error parameters when these are unknown in advance. We demonstrate the utility of our approach theoretically and via experiments on real-world data from randomized controlled trials conducted in healthcare and employment domains. As importantly, we demonstrate that models correcting for outcome measurement error or treatment effects alone suffer from considerable reliability limitations. Our work underscores the importance of considering intersectional threats to model validity during the design and evaluation of predictive models for decision support.","created":"2023-02-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11121v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

We use the latter to fill the missing labels and then select the best candidate model accordingly. Our non-asymptotic excess risk bounds show that in quite general scenarios, our estimator adapts to the structure of the target distribution as well as the covariate shift. It achieves the minimax optimal error rate up to a logarithmic factor. The use of pseudo-labels in model selection does not have major negative impacts.","created":"2023-02-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10160v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"A Benchmark of Nested Named Entity Recognition Approaches in Historical Structured Documents","abstract":"Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key step in the creation of structured data from digitised historical documents. Traditional NER approaches deal with flat named entities, whereas entities often are nested. For example, a postal address might contain a street name and a number. This work compares three nested NER approaches, including two state-of-the-art approaches using Transformer-based architectures. We introduce a new Transformer-based approach based on joint labelling and semantic weighting of errors, evaluated on a collection of 19 th-century Paris trade directories. We evaluate approaches regarding the impact of supervised fine-tuning, unsupervised pre-training with noisy texts, and variation of IOB tagging formats. Our results show that while nested NER approaches enable extracting structured data directly, they do not benefit from the extra knowledge provided during training and reach a performance similar to the base approach on flat entities. Even though all 3 approaches perform well in terms of F1 scores, joint labelling is most suitable for hierarchically structured data. Finally, our experiments reveal the superiority of the IO tagging format on such data.","created":"2023-02-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10204v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"An ASR-free Fluency Scoring Approach with Self-Supervised Learning","abstract":"A typical fluency scoring system generally relies on an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to obtain time stamps in input speech for either the subsequent calculation of fluency-related features or directly modeling speech fluency with an end-to-end approach. This paper describes a novel ASR-free approach for automatic fluency assessment using self-supervised learning (SSL). Specifically, wav2vec2.0 is used to extract frame-level speech features, followed by K-means clustering to assign a pseudo label (cluster index) to each frame. A BLSTM-based model is trained to predict an utterance-level fluency score from frame-level SSL features and the corresponding cluster indexes. Neither speech transcription nor time stamp information is required in the proposed system. It is ASR-free and can potentially avoid the ASR errors effect in practice. Experimental results carried out on non-native English databases show that the proposed approach significantly improves the performance in the \"open response\" scenario as compared to previous methods and matches the recently reported performance in the \"read aloud\" scenario.","created":"2023-02-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09928v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Towards Fine-Grained Information: Identifying the Type and Location of Translation Errors","abstract":"Fine-grained information on translation errors is helpful for the translation evaluation community. Existing approaches can not synchronously consider error position and type, failing to integrate the error information of both. In this paper, we propose Fine-Grained Translation Error Detection (FG-TED) task, aiming at identifying both the position and the type of translation errors on given source-hypothesis sentence pairs. Besides, we build an FG-TED model to predict the \\textbf{addition} and \\textbf{omission} errors -- two typical translation accuracy errors. First, we use a word-level classification paradigm to form our model and use the shortcut learning reduction to relieve the influence of monolingual features. Besides, we construct synthetic datasets for model training, and relieve the disagreement of data labeling in authoritative datasets, making the experimental benchmark concordant. Experiments show that our model can identify both error type and position concurrently, and gives state-of-the-art results on the restored dataset. Our model also delivers more reliable predictions on low-resource and transfer scenarios than existing baselines.

{"title":"Are Gaussian data all you need? Extents and limits of universality in high-dimensional generalized linear estimation","abstract":"In this manuscript we consider the problem of generalized linear estimation on Gaussian mixture data with labels given by a single-index model. Our first result is a sharp asymptotic expression for the test and training errors in the high-dimensional regime. Motivated by the recent stream of results on the Gaussian universality of the test and training errors in generalized linear estimation, we ask ourselves the question: \"when is a single Gaussian enough to characterize the error?\". Our formula allow us to give sharp answers to this question, both in the positive and negative directions. More precisely, we show that the sufficient conditions for Gaussian universality (or lack of thereof) crucially depend on the alignment between the target weights and the means and covariances of the mixture clusters, which we precisely quantify. In the particular case of least-squares interpolation, we prove a strong universality property of the training error, and show it follows a simple, closed-form expression. Finally, we apply our results to real datasets, clarifying some recent discussion in the literature about Gaussian universality of the errors in this context.","created":"2023-02-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08923v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Hate Speech and Offensive Language Detection using an Emotion-aware Shared Encoder","abstract":"The rise of emergence of social media platforms has fundamentally altered how people communicate, and among the results of these developments is an increase in online use of abusive content. Therefore, automatically detecting this content is essential for banning inappropriate information, and reducing toxicity and violence on social media platforms. The existing works on hate speech and offensive language detection produce promising results based on pre-trained transformer models, however, they considered only the analysis of abusive content features generated through annotated datasets. This paper addresses a multi-task joint learning approach which combines external emotional features extracted from another corpora in dealing with the imbalanced and scarcity of labeled datasets. Our analysis are using two well-known Transformer-based models, BERT and mBERT, where the later is used to address abusive content detection in multi-lingual scenarios. Our model jointly learns abusive content detection with emotional features by sharing representations through transformers' shared encoder. This approach increases data efficiency, reduce overfitting via shared representations, and ensure fast learning by leveraging auxiliary information. Our findings demonstrate that emotional knowledge helps to more reliably identify hate speech and offensive language across datasets. Our hate speech detection Multi-task model exhibited 3% performance improvement over baseline models, but the performance of multi-task models were not significant for offensive language detection task. More interestingly, in both tasks, multi-task models exhibits less false positive errors compared to single task scenario.","created":"2023-02-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08777v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Self-supervised Registration and Segmentation of the Ossicles with A Single Ground Truth Label","abstract":"AI-assisted surgeries have drawn the attention of the medical image research community due to their real-world impact on improving surgery success rates. For image-guided surgeries, such as Cochlear Implants (CIs), accurate object segmentation can provide useful information for surgeons before an operation. Recently published image segmentation methods that leverage machine learning usually rely on a large number of manually predefined ground truth labels. However, it is a laborious and time-consuming task to prepare the dataset. This paper presents a novel technique using a self-supervised 3D-UNet that produces a dense deformation field between an atlas and a target image that can be used for atlas-based segmentation of the ossicles. Our results show that our method outperforms traditional image segmentation methods and generates a more accurate boundary around the ossicles based on Dice similarity coefficient and point-to-point error comparison.

{"title":"Error Sensitivity Modulation based Experience Replay: Mitigating Abrupt Representation Drift in Continual Learning","abstract":"Humans excel at lifelong learning, as the brain has evolved to be robust to distribution shifts and noise in our ever-changing environment. Deep neural networks (DNNs), however, exhibit catastrophic forgetting and the learned representations drift drastically as they encounter a new task. This alludes to a different error-based learning mechanism in the brain. Unlike DNNs, where learning scales linearly with the magnitude of the error, the sensitivity to errors in the brain decreases as a function of their magnitude. To this end, we propose \\textit{ESMER} which employs a principled mechanism to modulate error sensitivity in a dual-memory rehearsal-based system. Concretely, it maintains a memory of past errors and uses it to modify the learning dynamics so that the model learns more from small consistent errors compared to large sudden errors. We also propose \\textit{Error-Sensitive Reservoir Sampling} to maintain episodic memory, which leverages the error history to pre-select low-loss samples as candidates for the buffer, which are better suited for retaining information. Empirical results show that ESMER effectively reduces forgetting and abrupt drift in representations at the task boundary by gradually adapting to the new task while consolidating knowledge. Remarkably, it also enables the model to learn under high levels of label noise, which is ubiquitous in real-world data streams.","created":"2023-02-14","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11344v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Self-supervised phase unwrapping in fringe projection profilometry","abstract":"Fast-speed and high-accuracy three-dimensional (3D) shape measurement has been the goal all along in fringe projection profilometry (FPP). The dual-frequency temporal phase unwrapping method (DF-TPU) is one of the prominent technologies to achieve this goal. However, the period number of the high-frequency pattern of existing DF-TPU approaches is usually limited by the inevitable phase errors, setting a limit to measurement accuracy. Deep-learning-based phase unwrapping methods for single-camera FPP usually require labeled data for training. In this letter, a novel self-supervised phase unwrapping method for single-camera FPP systems is proposed. The trained network can retrieve the absolute fringe order from one phase map of 64-period and overperform DF-TPU approaches in terms of depth accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the validation of the proposed method on real scenes of motion blur, isolated objects, low reflectivity, and phase discontinuity.","created":"2023-02-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06381v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"A Theoretical Understanding of Shallow Vision Transformers: Learning, Generalization, and Sample Complexity","abstract":"Vision Transformers (ViTs) with self-attention modules have recently achieved great empirical success in many vision tasks. Due to non-convex interactions across layers, however, theoretical learning and generalization analysis is mostly elusive. Based on a data model characterizing both label-relevant and label-irrelevant tokens, this paper provides the first theoretical analysis of training a shallow ViT, i.e., one self-attention layer followed by a two-layer perceptron, for a classification task. We characterize the sample complexity to achieve a zero generalization error. Our sample complexity bound is positively correlated with the inverse of the fraction of label-relevant tokens, the token noise level, and the initial model error. We also prove that a training process using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) leads to a sparse attention map, which is a formal verification of the general intuition about the success of attention. Moreover, this paper indicates that a proper token sparsification can improve the test performance by removing label-irrelevant and/or noisy tokens, including spurious correlations. Empirical experiments on synthetic data and CIFAR-10 dataset justify our theoretical results and generalize to deeper ViTs.","created":"2023-02-12","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06015v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Data efficiency and extrapolation trends in neural network interatomic potentials","abstract":"Over the last few years, key architectural advances have been proposed for neural network interatomic potentials (NNIPs), such as incorporating message-passing networks, equivariance, or many-body expansion terms. Although modern NNIP models exhibit nearly negligible differences in energy/forces errors, improvements in accuracy are still considered the main target when developing new NNIP architectures. In this work, we investigate how architectural choices influence the trainability and generalization error in NNIPs, revealing trends in extrapolation, data efficiency, and loss landscapes. First, we show that modern NNIP architectures recover the underlying potential energy surface (PES) of the training data even when trained to corrupted labels. Second, generalization metrics such as errors on high-temperature samples from the 3BPA dataset are demonstrated to follow a scaling relation for a variety of models. Thus, improvements in accuracy metrics may not bring independent information on the robust generalization of NNIPs. To circumvent this problem, we relate loss landscapes to model generalization across datasets. Using this probe, we explain why NNIPs with similar accuracy metrics exhibit different abilities to extrapolate and how training to forces improves the optimization landscape of a model. As an example, we show that MACE can predict PESes with reasonable error after being trained to as few as five data points, making it an example of a \"few-shot\" model for learning PESes. On the other hand, models with similar accuracy metrics such as NequIP show smaller ability to extrapolate in this extremely low-data regime. Our work provides a deep learning justification for the performance of many common NNIPs, and introduces tools beyond accuracy metrics that can be used to inform the development of next-generation models.","created":"2023-02-12","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05823v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Surrogate-Assisted Federated Learning of high dimensional Electronic Health Record Data","abstract":"Surrogate variables in electronic health records (EHR) play an important role in biomedical studies due to the scarcity or absence of chart-reviewed gold standard labels, under which supervised methods only using labeled data poorly perform poorly. Meanwhile, synthesizing multi-site EHR data is crucial for powerful and generalizable statistical learning but encounters the privacy constraint that individual-level data is not allowed to be transferred from the local sites, known as DataSHIELD. In this paper, we develop a novel approach named SASH for Surrogate-Assisted and data-Shielding High-dimensional integrative regression. SASH leverages sizable unlabeled data with EHR surrogates predictive of the response from multiple local sites to assist the training with labeled data and largely improve statistical efficiency. It first extracts a preliminary supervised estimator to realize convex training of a regularized single index model for the surrogate at each local site and then aggregates the fitted local models for accurate learning of the target outcome model. It protects individual-level information from the local sites through summary-statistics-based data aggregation. We show that under mild conditions, our method attains substantially lower estimation error rates than the supervised or local semi-supervised methods, as well as the asymptotic equivalence to the ideal individual patient data pooled estimator (IPD) only available in the absence of privacy constraints. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that SASH outperforms all existing supervised or SS federated approaches and performs closely to IPD. Finally, we apply our method to develop a high dimensional genetic risk model for type II diabetes using large-scale biobank data sets from UK Biobank and Mass General Brigham, where only a small fraction of subjects from the latter has been labeled via chart reviewing.","created":"2023-02-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04970v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Dimension reduction and redundancy removal through successive Schmidt decompositions","abstract":"Quantum computers are believed to have the ability to process huge data sizes which can be seen in machine learning applications. In these applications, the data in general is classical. Therefore, to process them on a quantum computer, there is a need for efficient methods which can be used to map classical data on quantum states in a concise manner. On the other hand, to verify the results of quantum computers and study quantum algorithms, we need to be able to approximate quantum operations into forms that are easier to simulate on classical computers with some errors.   Motivated by these needs, in this paper we study the approximation of matrices and vectors by using their tensor products obtained through successive Schmidt decompositions. We show that data with distributions such as uniform, Poisson, exponential, or similar to these distributions can be approximated by using only a few terms which can be easily mapped onto quantum circuits. The examples include random data with different distributions, the Gram matrices of iris flower, handwritten digits, 20newsgroup, and labeled faces in the wild. And similarly, some quantum operations such as quantum Fourier transform and variational quantum circuits with a small depth also may be approximated with a few terms that are easier to simulate on classical computers. Furthermore, we show how the method can be used to simplify quantum Hamiltonians: In particular, we show the application to randomly generated transverse field Ising model Hamiltonians. The reduced Hamiltonians can be mapped into quantum circuits easily and therefore can be simulated more efficiently.","created":"2023-02-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04801v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"On Fairness and Stability: Is Estimator Variance a Friend or a Foe?","abstract":"The error of an estimator can be decomposed into a (statistical) bias term, a variance term, and an irreducible noise term. When we do bias analysis, formally we are asking the question: \"how good are the predictions?\" The role of bias in the error decomposition is clear: if we trust the labels/targets, then we would want the estimator to have as low bias as possible, in order to minimize error. Fair machine learning is concerned with the question: \"Are the predictions equally good for different demographic/social groups?\" This has naturally led to a variety of fairness metrics that compare some measure of statistical bias on subsets corresponding to socially privileged and socially disadvantaged groups. In this paper we propose a new family of performance measures based on group-wise parity in variance. We demonstrate when group-wise statistical bias analysis gives an incomplete picture, and what group-wise variance analysis can tell us in settings that differ in the magnitude of statistical bias. We develop and release an open-source library that reconciles uncertainty quantification techniques with fairness analysis, and use it to conduct an extensive empirical analysis of our variance-based fairness measures on standard benchmarks.","created":"2023-02-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04525v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"On the Richness of Calibration","abstract":"Probabilistic predictions can be evaluated through comparisons with observed label frequencies, that is, through the lens of calibration. Recent scholarship on algorithmic fairness has started to look at a growing variety of calibration-based objectives under the name of multi-calibration but has still remained fairly restricted. In this paper, we explore and analyse forms of evaluation through calibration by making explicit the choices involved in designing calibration scores. We organise these into three grouping choices and a choice concerning the agglomeration of group errors. This provides a framework for comparing previously proposed calibration scores and helps to formulate novel ones with desirable mathematical properties. In particular, we explore the possibility of grouping datapoints based on their input features rather than on predictions and formally demonstrate advantages of such approaches. We also characterise the space of suitable agglomeration functions for group errors, generalising previously proposed calibration scores. Complementary to such population-level scores, we explore calibration scores at the individual level and analyse their relationship to choices of grouping. We draw on these insights to introduce and axiomatise fairness deviation measures for population-level scores. We demonstrate that with appropriate choices of grouping, these novel global fairness scores can provide notions of (sub-)group or individual fairness.","created":"2023-02-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04118v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"A Bipartite Ranking Approach to the Two-Sample Problem","abstract":"The two-sample problem, which consists in testing whether independent samples on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ are drawn from the same (unknown) distribution, finds applications in many areas. Its study in high-dimension is the subject of much attention, especially because the information acquisition processes at work in the Big Data era often involve various sources, poorly controlled, leading to datasets possibly exhibiting a strong sampling bias. While classic methods relying on the computation of a discrepancy measure between the empirical distributions face the curse of dimensionality, we develop an alternative approach based on statistical learning and extending rank tests, capable of detecting small departures from the null assumption in the univariate case when appropriately designed. Overcoming the lack of natural order on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ when $d\\geq 2$, it is implemented in two steps. Assigning to each of the samples a label (positive vs. negative) and dividing them into two parts, a preorder on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by a real-valued scoring function is learned by means of a bipartite ranking algorithm applied to the first part and a rank test is applied next to the scores of the remaining observations to detect possible differences in distribution. Because it learns how to project the data onto the real line nearly like (any monotone transform of) the likelihood ratio between the original multivariate distributions would do, the approach is not much affected by the dimensionality, ignoring ranking model bias issues, and preserves the advantages of univariate rank tests. Nonasymptotic error bounds are proved based on recent concentration results for two-sample linear rank-processes and an experimental study shows that the approach promoted surpasses alternative methods standing as natural competitors.","created":"2023-02-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03592v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

Decoupling these two tasks enables training of the \"speaking\" module using abundant audio-only data, and unlocks the highly efficient combination of pretraining and backtranslation to reduce the need for parallel data when training the \"reading\" component. To control the speaker identity, we adopt example prompting, which allows SPEAR-TTS to generalize to unseen speakers using only a short sample of 3 seconds, without any explicit speaker representation or speaker-id labels.

{"title":"Revisiting Discriminative vs. Generative Classifiers: Theory and Implications","abstract":"A large-scale deep model pre-trained on massive labeled or unlabeled data transfers well to downstream tasks. Linear evaluation freezes parameters in the pre-trained model and trains a linear classifier separately, which is efficient and attractive for transfer. However, little work has investigated the classifier in linear evaluation except for the default logistic regression. Inspired by the statistical efficiency of naive Bayes, the paper revisits the classical topic on discriminative vs. generative classifiers. Theoretically, the paper considers the surrogate loss instead of the zero-one loss in analyses and generalizes the classical results from binary cases to multiclass ones. We show that, under mild assumptions, multiclass naive Bayes requires $O(\\log n)$ samples to approach its asymptotic error while the corresponding multiclass logistic regression requires $O(n)$ samples, where $n$ is the feature dimension. To establish it, we present a multiclass $\\mathcal{H}$-consistency bound framework and an explicit bound for logistic loss, which are of independent interests. Simulation results on a mixture of Gaussian validate our theoretical findings. Experiments on various pre-trained deep vision models show that naive Bayes consistently converges faster as the number of data increases.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel generalization bound that reweights source classification error by aligning source and target sub-domains. We prove that our proposed generalization bound is at least as strong as existing bounds under realistic assumptions, and we empirically show that it is much stronger on real-world data.

{"title":"SkinCon: A skin disease dataset densely annotated by domain experts for fine-grained model debugging and analysis","abstract":"For the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in high-risk settings, such as healthcare, methods that provide interpretability/explainability or allow fine-grained error analysis are critical. Many recent methods for interpretability/explainability and fine-grained error analysis use concepts, which are meta-labels that are semantically meaningful to humans. However, there are only a few datasets that include concept-level meta-labels and most of these meta-labels are relevant for natural images that do not require domain expertise. Densely annotated datasets in medicine focused on meta-labels that are relevant to a single disease such as melanoma. In dermatology, skin disease is described using an established clinical lexicon that allows clinicians to describe physical exam findings to one another. To provide a medical dataset densely annotated by domain experts with annotations useful across multiple disease processes, we developed SkinCon: a skin disease dataset densely annotated by dermatologists. SkinCon includes 3230 images from the Fitzpatrick 17k dataset densely annotated with 48 clinical concepts, 22 of which have at least 50 images representing the concept. The concepts used were chosen by two dermatologists considering the clinical descriptor terms used to describe skin lesions. Examples include \"plaque\", \"scale\", and \"erosion\".

{"title":"Learning from Stochastic Labels","abstract":"Annotating multi-class instances is a crucial task in the field of machine learning. Unfortunately, identifying the correct class label from a long sequence of candidate labels is time-consuming and laborious. To alleviate this problem, we design a novel labeling mechanism called stochastic label. In this setting, stochastic label includes two cases: 1) identify a correct class label from a small number of randomly given labels; 2) annotate the instance with None label when given labels do not contain correct class label. In this paper, we propose a novel suitable approach to learn from these stochastic labels. We obtain an unbiased estimator that utilizes less supervised information in stochastic labels to train a multi-class classifier. Additionally, it is theoretically justifiable by deriving the estimation error bound of the proposed method. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets to validate the superiority of our method by comparing it with existing state-of-the-art methods.","created":"2023-02-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00299v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Rethinking Soft Label in Label Distribution Learning Perspective","abstract":"The primary goal of training in early convolutional neural networks (CNN) is the higher generalization performance of the model. However, as the expected calibration error (ECE), which quantifies the explanatory power of model inference, was recently introduced, research on training models that can be explained is in progress. We hypothesized that a gap in supervision criteria during training and inference leads to overconfidence, and investigated that performing label distribution learning (LDL) would enhance the model calibration in CNN training. To verify this assumption, we used a simple LDL setting with recent data augmentation techniques. Based on a series of experiments, the following results are obtained: 1) State-of-the-art KD methods significantly impede model calibration. 2) Training using LDL with recent data augmentation can have excellent effects on model calibration and even in generalization performance. 3) Online LDL brings additional improvements in model calibration and accuracy with long training, especially in large-size models. Using the proposed approach, we simultaneously achieved a lower ECE and higher generalization performance for the image classification datasets CIFAR10, 100, STL10, and ImageNet. We performed several visualizations and analyses and witnessed several interesting behaviors in CNN training with the LDL.","created":"2023-01-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13444v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Demystifying Disagreement-on-the-Line in High Dimensions","abstract":"Evaluating the performance of machine learning models under distribution shift is challenging, especially when we only have unlabeled data from the shifted (target) domain, along with labeled data from the original (source) domain. Recent work suggests that the notion of disagreement, the degree to which two models trained with different randomness differ on the same input, is a key to tackle this problem. Experimentally, disagreement and prediction error have been shown to be strongly connected, which has been used to estimate model performance. Experiments have led to the discovery of the disagreement-on-the-line phenomenon, whereby the classification error under the target domain is often a linear function of the classification error under the source domain; and whenever this property holds, disagreement under the source and target domain follow the same linear relation. In this work, we develop a theoretical foundation for analyzing disagreement in high-dimensional random features regression; and study under what conditions the disagreement-on-the-line phenomenon occurs in our setting. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C, Tiny ImageNet-C, and Camelyon17 are consistent with our theory and support the universality of the theoretical findings.","created":"2023-01-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13371v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

Most of the current methods for model-free grasping are disadvantaged by the sparse data in grasping datasets and by errors in sensor data and contact models. This study combines data generation and sim-to-real transfer learning in a grasping framework that reduces the sim-to-real gap and enables precise and reliable model-free grasping. A large-scale robotic grasping dataset with dense grasp labels is generated using domain randomization methods and a novel data augmentation method for deep learning-based robotic grasping to solve data sparse problem.

{"title":"DALI: Dynamically Adjusted Label Importance for Noisy Partial Label Learning","abstract":"Noisy partial label learning (noisy PLL) is an important branch of weakly supervised learning. Unlike PLL where the ground-truth label must reside in the candidate set, noisy PLL relaxes this constraint and allows the ground-truth label may not be in the candidate set. To address this problem, existing works attempt to detect noisy samples and estimate the ground-truth label for each noisy sample. However, detection errors are inevitable, and these errors will accumulate during training and continuously affect model optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for noisy PLL, called ``Dynamically Adjusted Label Importance (DALI)''. It aims to reduce the negative impact of detection errors by trading off the initial candidate set and model outputs with theoretical guarantees. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that our DALI succeeds over existing state-of-the-art approaches on noisy PLL.

To correct the classification errors and significantly increase the network's depth, we train each layer with new labels derived from the residual information of all its preceding layers. This learning mechanism is accomplished by traversing the network's layers in a single forward pass without backpropagation or gradient computations.

{"title":"Adversarial Learning for Implicit Semantic-Aware Communications","abstract":"Semantic communication is a novel communication paradigm that focuses on recognizing and delivering the desired meaning of messages to the destination users. Most existing works in this area focus on delivering explicit semantics, labels or signal features that can be directly identified from the source signals. In this paper, we consider the implicit semantic communication problem in which hidden relations and closely related semantic terms that cannot be recognized from the source signals need to also be delivered to the destination user. We develop a novel adversarial learning-based implicit semantic-aware communication (iSAC) architecture in which the source user, instead of maximizing the total amount of information transmitted to the channel, aims to help the recipient learn an inference rule that can automatically generate implicit semantics based on limited clue information. We prove that by applying iSAC, the destination user can always learn an inference rule that matches the true inference rule of the source messages. Experimental results show that the proposed iSAC can offer up to a 19.69 dB improvement over existing non-inferential communication solutions, in terms of symbol error rate at the destination user.","created":"2023-01-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11589v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Recent self-labeling methods based on such losses represent the state of the art in deep clustering. However, some important properties of entropy clustering are not well-known, or even misunderstood. For example, we provide a counterexample to prior claims about equivalence to variance clustering (K-means) and point out technical mistakes in such theories. We discuss the fundamental differences between these discriminative and generative clustering approaches. Moreover, we show the susceptibility of standard entropy clustering to narrow margins and motivate an explicit margin maximization term. We also propose an improved self-labeling loss; it is robust to pseudo-labeling errors and enforces stronger fairness. We develop an EM algorithm for our loss that is significantly faster than the standard alternatives.

{"title":"Exploring Active 3D Object Detection from a Generalization Perspective","abstract":"To alleviate the high annotation cost in LiDAR-based 3D object detection, active learning is a promising solution that learns to select only a small portion of unlabeled data to annotate, without compromising model performance. Our empirical study, however, suggests that mainstream uncertainty-based and diversity-based active learning policies are not effective when applied in the 3D detection task, as they fail to balance the trade-off between point cloud informativeness and box-level annotation costs. To overcome this limitation, we jointly investigate three novel criteria in our framework Crb for point cloud acquisition - label conciseness}, feature representativeness and geometric balance, which hierarchically filters out the point clouds of redundant 3D bounding box labels, latent features and geometric characteristics (e.g., point cloud density) from the unlabeled sample pool and greedily selects informative ones with fewer objects to annotate. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed criteria align the marginal distributions of the selected subset and the prior distributions of the unseen test set, and minimizes the upper bound of the generalization error. To validate the effectiveness and applicability of Crb, we conduct extensive experiments on the two benchmark 3D object detection datasets of KITTI and Waymo and examine both one-stage (i.e., Second) and two-stage 3D detectors (i.e., Pv-rcnn).

With the disparity maps estimated by multiple input combinations, we propose a disparity fusion strategy based on the estimated errors with effective occlusion handling to obtain the final disparity map.

While the technology has a potential for facilitating tasks carried out in language documentation projects, such as speech transcription, pretraining a multilingual model from scratch for every new language would be highly impractical. We investigate the possibility for adapting an existing multilingual wav2vec 2.0 model for a new language, focusing on actual fieldwork data from a critically endangered tongue: Ainu.

Our results show that continued pretraining is the most effective method to adapt a wav2vec 2.0 model for a new language and leads to considerable reduction in error rates.

{"title":"Cross-domain Unsupervised Reconstruction with Equivariance for Photoacoustic Computed Tomography","abstract":"Accurate image reconstruction is crucial for photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT). Recently, deep learning has been used to reconstruct the PA image with a supervised scheme, which requires high-quality images as ground truth labels. In practice, there are inevitable trade-offs between cost and performance since the use of more channels is an expensive strategy to access more measurements. Here, we propose a cross-domain unsupervised reconstruction (CDUR) strategy with a pure transformer model, which overcomes the lack of ground truth labels from limited PA measurements. The proposed approach exploits the equivariance of PACT to achieve high performance with a smaller number of channels. We implement a self-supervised reconstruction in a model-based form. Meanwhile, we also leverage the self-supervision to enforce the measurement and image consistency on three partitions of measured PA data, by randomly masking different channels. We find that dynamically masking a high proportion of the channels, e.g., 80%, yields nontrivial self-supervisors in both image and signal domains, which decrease the multiplicity of the pseudo solution to efficiently reconstruct the image from fewer PA measurements with minimum error of the image. Experimental results on in-vivo PACT dataset of mice demonstrate the potential of our unsupervised framework. In addition, our method shows a high performance (0.83 structural similarity index (SSIM) in the extreme sparse case with 13 channels), which is close to that of supervised scheme (0.77 SSIM with 16 channels).

The goal of the proposed defence is to reveal whether a Deep Neural Network model is subject to a backdoor attack by inspecting the training dataset. CCA-UD first clusters the samples of the training set by means of density-based clustering. Then, it applies a novel strategy to detect the presence of poisoned clusters. The proposed strategy is based on a general misclassification behaviour obtained when the features of a representative example of the analysed cluster are added to benign samples. The capability of inducing a misclassification error is a general characteristic of poisoned samples, hence the proposed defence is attack-agnostic. This mask a significant difference with respect to existing defences, that, either can defend against only some types of backdoor attacks, e.g., when the attacker corrupts the label of the poisoned samples, or are effective only when some conditions on the poisoning ratios adopted by the attacker or the kind of triggering pattern used by the attacker are satisfied. Experiments carried out on several classification tasks, considering different types of backdoor attacks and triggering patterns, including both local and global triggers, reveal that the proposed method is very effective to defend against backdoor attacks in all the cases, always outperforming the state of the art techniques.","created":"2023-01-11","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04554v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Semi-Supervised Learning with Pseudo-Negative Labels for Image Classification","abstract":"Semi-supervised learning frameworks usually adopt mutual learning approaches with multiple submodels to learn from different perspectives. To avoid transferring erroneous pseudo labels between these submodels, a high threshold is usually used to filter out a large number of low-confidence predictions for unlabeled data. However, such filtering can not fully exploit unlabeled data with low prediction confidence. To overcome this problem, in this work, we propose a mutual learning framework based on pseudo-negative labels. Negative labels are those that a corresponding data item does not belong. In each iteration, one submodel generates pseudo-negative labels for each data item, and the other submodel learns from these labels. The role of the two submodels exchanges after each iteration until convergence. By reducing the prediction probability on pseudo-negative labels, the dual model can improve its prediction ability. We also propose a mechanism to select a few pseudo-negative labels to feed into submodels. In the experiments, our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on several main benchmarks. Specifically, with our framework, the error rates of the 13-layer CNN model are 9.35% and 7.94% for CIFAR-10 with 1000 and 4000 labels, respectively. In addition, for the non-augmented MNIST with only 20 labels, the error rate is 0.81% by our framework, which is much smaller than that of other approaches.

{"title":"FedDebug: Systematic Debugging for Federated Learning Applications","abstract":"In Federated Learning (FL), clients train a model locally and share it with a central aggregator to build a global model. Impermissibility to access client's data and collaborative training makes FL appealing for applications with data-privacy concerns such as medical imaging. However, these FL characteristics pose unprecedented challenges for debugging. When a global model's performance deteriorates, finding the round and the clients responsible is a major pain point. Developers resort to trial-and-error debugging with subsets of clients, hoping to increase the accuracy or let future FL rounds retune the model, which are time-consuming and costly.   We design a systematic fault localization framework, FedDebug, that advances the FL debugging on two novel fronts. First, FedDebug enables interactive debugging of realtime collaborative training in FL by leveraging record and replay techniques to construct a simulation that mirrors live FL. FedDebug's {\\em breakpoint} can help inspect an FL state (round, client, and global model) and seamlessly move between rounds and clients' models, enabling a fine-grained step-by-step inspection. Second, FedDebug automatically identifies the client responsible for lowering global model's performance without any testing data and labels--both are essential for existing debugging techniques. FedDebug's strengths come from adapting differential testing in conjunction with neurons activations to determine the precise client deviating from normal behavior. FedDebug achieves 100\\% to find a single client and 90.3\\% accuracy to find multiple faulty clients. FedDebug's interactive debugging incurs 1.2\\% overhead during training, while it localizes a faulty client in only 2.1\\% of a round's training time. With FedDebug, we bring effective debugging practices to federated learning, improving the quality and productivity of FL application developers.","created":"2023-01-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03553v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Mimicking non-ideal instrument behavior for hologram processing using neural style translation","abstract":"Holographic cloud probes provide unprecedented information on cloud particle density, size and position. Each laser shot captures particles within a large volume, where images can be computationally refocused to determine particle size and shape. However, processing these holograms, either with standard methods or with machine learning (ML) models, requires considerable computational resources, time and occasional human intervention. ML models are trained on simulated holograms obtained from the physical model of the probe since real holograms have no absolute truth labels. Using another processing method to produce labels would be subject to errors that the ML model would subsequently inherit. Models perform well on real holograms only when image corruption is performed on the simulated images during training, thereby mimicking non-ideal conditions in the actual probe (Schreck et. al, 2022). Optimizing image corruption requires a cumbersome manual labeling effort.   Here we demonstrate the application of the neural style translation approach (Gatys et. al, 2016) to the simulated holograms. With a pre-trained convolutional neural network (VGG-19), the simulated holograms are ``stylized'' to resemble the real ones obtained from the probe, while at the same time preserving the simulated image ``content'' (e.g. the particle locations and sizes). Two image similarity metrics concur that the stylized images are more like real holograms than the synthetic ones. With an ML model trained to predict particle locations and shapes on the stylized data sets, we observed comparable performance on both simulated and real holograms, obviating the need to perform manual labeling. The described approach is not specific to hologram images and could be applied in other domains for capturing noise and imperfections in observational instruments to make simulated data more like real world observations.","created":"2023-01-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02757v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Deep Learning for Short-Latency Epileptic Seizure Detection with Probabilistic Classification","abstract":"In this manuscript, we propose a novel deep learning (DL)-based framework intended for obtaining short latency in real-time electroencephalogram-based epileptic seizure detection using multiscale 3D convolutional neural networks. We pioneer converting seizure detection task from traditional binary classification of samples from ictal and interictal periods to probabilistic classification of samples from interictal, ictal, and crossing periods. We introduce a crossing period from seizure-oriented EEG recording and propose a labelling rule using soft-label for samples from the crossing period to build a probabilistic classification task. A novel multiscale short-time Fourier transform feature extraction method and 3D convolution neural network architecture are proposed to accurately capture predictive probabilities of samples. Furthermore, we also propose rectified weighting strategy to enhance predictive probabilities, and accumulative decision-making rule to achieve short detection latency. We implement leave-one-seizure-out cross validation on two prevalent datasets -- CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset and SWEC-ETHZ intracranial EEG dataset. Eventually, the proposed algorithm achieved 94 out of 99 seizures detected during the crossing period, averaged 14.84% rectified predictive ictal probability (RPIP) errors of crossing samples, 2.3 s detection latency, 0.32/h false detection rate on CHB-MIT dataset, meanwhile 84 out of 89 detected seizures, 16.17% RPIP errors, 4.7 s detection latency, and 0.75/h FDR are achieved on SWEC-ETHZ dataset.

{"title":"Audio-Visual Efficient Conformer for Robust Speech Recognition","abstract":"End-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems based on neural networks have seen large improvements in recent years. The availability of large scale hand-labeled datasets and sufficient computing resources made it possible to train powerful deep neural networks, reaching very low Word Error Rate (WER) on academic benchmarks. However, despite impressive performance on clean audio samples, a drop of performance is often observed on noisy speech. In this work, we propose to improve the noise robustness of the recently proposed Efficient Conformer Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based architecture by processing both audio and visual modalities. We improve previous lip reading methods using an Efficient Conformer back-end on top of a ResNet-18 visual front-end and by adding intermediate CTC losses between blocks. We condition intermediate block features on early predictions using Inter CTC residual modules to relax the conditional independence assumption of CTC-based models. We also replace the Efficient Conformer grouped attention by a more efficient and simpler attention mechanism that we call patch attention. We experiment with publicly available Lip Reading Sentences 2 (LRS2) and Lip Reading Sentences 3 (LRS3) datasets. Our experiments show that using audio and visual modalities allows to better recognize speech in the presence of environmental noise and significantly accelerate training, reaching lower WER with 4 times less training steps. Our Audio-Visual Efficient Conformer (AVEC) model achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching WER of 2.3% and 1.8% on LRS2 and LRS3 test sets.

{"title":"Unsupervised Multivariate Time-Series Transformers for Seizure Identification on EEG","abstract":"Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, typically observed via seizure episodes. Epileptic seizures are commonly monitored through electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings due to their routine and low expense collection. The stochastic nature of EEG makes seizure identification via manual inspections performed by highly-trained experts a tedious endeavor, motivating the use of automated identification. The literature on automated identification focuses mostly on supervised learning methods requiring expert labels of EEG segments that contain seizures, which are difficult to obtain. Motivated by these observations, we pose seizure identification as an unsupervised anomaly detection problem. To this end, we employ the first unsupervised transformer-based model for seizure identification on raw EEG. We train an autoencoder involving a transformer encoder via an unsupervised loss function, incorporating a novel masking strategy uniquely designed for multivariate time-series data such as EEG. Training employs EEG recordings that do not contain any seizures, while seizures are identified with respect to reconstruction errors at inference time. We evaluate our method on three publicly available benchmark EEG datasets for distinguishing seizure vs. non-seizure windows. Our method leads to significantly better seizure identification performance than supervised learning counterparts, by up to 16% recall, 9% accuracy, and 9% Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC), establishing particular benefits on highly imbalanced data. Through accurate seizure identification, our method could facilitate widely accessible and early detection of epilepsy development, without needing expensive label collection or manual feature extraction.","created":"2023-01-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03470v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Tracking Passengers and Baggage Items using Multiple Overhead Cameras at Security Checkpoints","abstract":"We introduce a novel framework to track multiple objects in overhead camera videos for airport checkpoint security scenarios where targets correspond to passengers and their baggage items. We propose a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) technique to provide the model information about instance segmentation uncertainty from overhead images. Our SSL approach improves object detection by employing a test-time data augmentation and a regression-based, rotation-invariant pseudo-label refinement technique. Our pseudo-label generation method provides multiple geometrically-transformed images as inputs to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), regresses the augmented detections generated by the network to reduce localization errors, and then clusters them using the mean-shift algorithm. The self-supervised detector model is used in a single-camera tracking algorithm to generate temporal identifiers for the targets. Our method also incorporates a multi-view trajectory association mechanism to maintain consistent temporal identifiers as passengers travel across camera views. An evaluation of detection, tracking, and association performances on videos obtained from multiple overhead cameras in a realistic airport checkpoint environment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our results show that self-supervision improves object detection accuracy by up to $42\\%$ without increasing the inference time of the model.

{"title":"Unlearnable Clusters: Towards Label-agnostic Unlearnable Examples","abstract":"There is a growing interest in developing unlearnable examples (UEs) against visual privacy leaks on the Internet. UEs are training samples added with invisible but unlearnable noise, which have been found can prevent unauthorized training of machine learning models. UEs typically are generated via a bilevel optimization framework with a surrogate model to remove (minimize) errors from the original samples, and then applied to protect the data against unknown target models. However, existing UE generation methods all rely on an ideal assumption called label-consistency, where the hackers and protectors are assumed to hold the same label for a given sample. In this work, we propose and promote a more practical label-agnostic setting, where the hackers may exploit the protected data quite differently from the protectors. E.g., a m-class unlearnable dataset held by the protector may be exploited by the hacker as a n-class dataset. Existing UE generation methods are rendered ineffective in this challenging setting. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel technique called Unlearnable Clusters (UCs) to generate label-agnostic unlearnable examples with cluster-wise perturbations. Furthermore, we propose to leverage VisionandLanguage Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) like CLIP as the surrogate model to improve the transferability of the crafted UCs to diverse domains. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach under a variety of settings with different datasets, target models, and even commercial platforms Microsoft Azure and Baidu PaddlePaddle.

{"title":"An Analysis of Attention via the Lens of Exchangeability and Latent Variable Models","abstract":"With the attention mechanism, transformers achieve significant empirical successes. Despite the intuitive understanding that transformers perform relational inference over long sequences to produce desirable representations, we lack a rigorous theory on how the attention mechanism achieves it. In particular, several intriguing questions remain open: (a) What makes a desirable representation? (b) How does the attention mechanism infer the desirable representation within the forward pass? (c) How does a pretraining procedure learn to infer the desirable representation through the backward pass?   We observe that, as is the case in BERT and ViT, input tokens are often exchangeable since they already include positional encodings. The notion of exchangeability induces a latent variable model that is invariant to input sizes, which enables our theoretical analysis.   - To answer (a) on representation, we establish the existence of a sufficient and minimal representation of input tokens. In particular, such a representation instantiates the posterior distribution of the latent variable given input tokens, which plays a central role in predicting output labels and solving downstream tasks.   - To answer (b) on inference, we prove that attention with the desired parameter infers the latent posterior up to an approximation error, which is decreasing in input sizes. In detail, we quantify how attention approximates the conditional mean of the value given the key, which characterizes how it performs relational inference over long sequences.   - To answer (c) on learning, we prove that both supervised and self-supervised objectives allow empirical risk minimization to learn the desired parameter up to a generalization error, which is independent of input sizes. Particularly, in the self-supervised setting, we identify a condition number that is pivotal to solving downstream tasks.","created":"2022-12-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14852v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"AER: Auto-Encoder with Regression for Time Series Anomaly Detection","abstract":"Anomaly detection on time series data is increasingly common across various industrial domains that monitor metrics in order to prevent potential accidents and economic losses. However, a scarcity of labeled data and ambiguous definitions of anomalies can complicate these efforts. Recent unsupervised machine learning methods have made remarkable progress in tackling this problem using either single-timestamp predictions or time series reconstructions. While traditionally considered separately, these methods are not mutually exclusive and can offer complementary perspectives on anomaly detection. This paper first highlights the successes and limitations of prediction-based and reconstruction-based methods with visualized time series signals and anomaly scores. We then propose AER (Auto-encoder with Regression), a joint model that combines a vanilla auto-encoder and an LSTM regressor to incorporate the successes and address the limitations of each method. Our model can produce bi-directional predictions while simultaneously reconstructing the original time series by optimizing a joint objective function. Furthermore, we propose several ways of combining the prediction and reconstruction errors through a series of ablation studies. Finally, we compare the performance of the AER architecture against two prediction-based methods and three reconstruction-based methods on 12 well-known univariate time series datasets from NASA, Yahoo, Numenta, and UCR. The results show that AER has the highest averaged F1 score across all datasets (a 23.5% improvement compared to ARIMA) while retaining a runtime similar to its vanilla auto-encoder and regressor components.

Therefore, an SSL method should provide robust generalization and uncertainty estimation in the test dataset to be considered a reliable model in such high-stakes domains. However, existing approaches often focus on generalization, without evaluating the model's uncertainty. The ability to compare SSL techniques for improving these estimates is therefore critical for research on the reliability of self-supervision models.

However, it is unclear if automatic metrics are reliable at distinguishing good translations from bad translations at the sentence level (segment-level evaluation). In this paper, we investigate how useful MT metrics are at detecting the success of a machine translation component when placed in a larger platform with a downstream task. We evaluate the segment-level performance of the most widely used MT metrics (chrF, COMET, BERTScore, etc.) on three downstream cross-lingual tasks (dialogue state tracking, question answering, and semantic parsing). For each task, we only have access to a monolingual task-specific model. We calculate the correlation between the metric's ability to predict a good/bad translation with the success/failure on the final task for the Translate-Test setup. Our experiments demonstrate that all metrics exhibit negligible correlation with the extrinsic evaluation of the downstream outcomes. We also find that the scores provided by neural metrics are not interpretable mostly because of undefined ranges. Our analysis suggests that future MT metrics be designed to produce error labels rather than scores to facilitate extrinsic evaluation.","created":"2022-12-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10297v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Lightweight integration of 3D features to improve 2D image segmentation","abstract":"Scene understanding is a major challenge of today's computer vision. Center to this task is image segmentation, since scenes are often provided as a set of pictures. Nowadays, many such datasets also provide 3D geometry information given as a 3D point cloud acquired by a laser scanner or a depth camera. To exploit this geometric information, many current approaches rely on both a 2D loss and 3D loss, requiring not only 2D per pixel labels but also 3D per point labels. However obtaining a 3D groundtruth is challenging, time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we show that image segmentation can benefit from 3D geometric information without requiring any 3D groundtruth, by training the geometric feature extraction with a 2D segmentation loss in an end-to-end fashion. Our method starts by extracting a map of 3D features directly from the point cloud by using a lightweight and simple 3D encoder neural network. The 3D feature map is then used as an additional input to a classical image segmentation network. During training, the 3D features extraction is optimized for the segmentation task by back-propagation through the entire pipeline. Our method exhibits state-of-the-art performance with much lighter input dataset requirements, since no 3D groundtruth is required.","created":"2022-12-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08334v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

We draw particular attention to extracting high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from video cameras as traffic monitoring cameras are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. We explore methods for automatic trajectory data reconciliation, given \"raw\" vehicle detection and tracking information from automatic video processing algorithms.

The pipeline leverages vehicle dynamics and physical constraints to associate tracked objects when they become fragmented, remove measurement noise on trajectories and impute missing data due to fragmentations. The accuracy is benchmarked on a sample of manually-labeled data, which shows that the reconciled trajectories improve the accuracy on all the tested input data for a wide range of measures.

This value has been recently proposed and studied in the context of relational database queries and has uses in a plethora of other domains.   We first study the contribution of edges and show that the exact Shapley value is almost always hard to compute. Specifically, it is #P-hard to calculate the contribution of an edge whenever at least one (non-redundant) conjunct allows for a word of length three or more. In the case of regular path queries (i.e., no conjunction), the problem is tractable if the query has only words of length at most two; hence, this property fully characterizes the tractability of the problem. On the other hand, if we allow for an approximation error, then it is straightforward to obtain an efficient scheme (FPRAS) for an additive approximation. Yet, a multiplicative approximation is harder to obtain. We establish that in the case of conjunctive regular path queries, a multiplicative approximation of the Shapley value of an edge can be computed in polynomial time if and only if all query atoms are finite languages (assuming non-redundancy and conventional complexity limitations). We also study the analogous situation where we wish to determine the contribution of a vertex, rather than an edge, and establish complexity results of similar nature.","created":"2022-12-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07720v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Deep leakage from gradients","abstract":"With the development of artificial intelligence technology, Federated Learning (FL) model has been widely used in many industries for its high efficiency and confidentiality. Some researchers have explored its confidentiality and designed some algorithms to attack training data sets, but these algorithms all have their own limitations. Therefore, most people still believe that local machine learning gradient information is safe and reliable. In this paper, an algorithm based on gradient features is designed to attack the federated learning model in order to attract more attention to the security of federated learning systems. In federated learning system, gradient contains little information compared with the original training data set, but this project intends to restore the original training image data through gradient information. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has excellent performance in image processing. Therefore, the federated learning model of this project is equipped with Convolutional Neural Network structure, and the model is trained by using image data sets. The algorithm calculates the virtual gradient by generating virtual image labels. Then the virtual gradient is matched with the real gradient to restore the original image. This attack algorithm is written in Python language, uses cat and dog classification Kaggle data sets, and gradually extends from the full connection layer to the convolution layer, thus improving the universality. At present, the average squared error between the data recovered by this algorithm and the original image information is approximately 5, and the vast majority of images can be completely restored according to the gradient information given, indicating that the gradient of federated learning system is not absolutely safe and reliable.","created":"2022-12-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02621v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Sequential Labelling and DNABERT For Splice Site Prediction in Homo Sapiens DNA","abstract":"Genome sequencing technology has improved significantly in few last years and resulted in abundance genetic data. Artificial intelligence has been employed to analyze genetic data in response to its sheer size and variability. Gene prediction on single DNA has been conducted using various deep learning architectures to discover splice sites and therefore discover intron and exon region. Recent predictions are carried out with models trained on sequence with fixed splice site location which eliminates possibility of multiple splice sites existence in single sequence. This paper proposes sequential labelling to predict splice sites regardless their position in sequence. Sequential labelling is carried out on DNA to determine intron and exon region and thus discover splice sites. Sequential labelling models used are based on pretrained DNABERT-3 which has been trained on human genome. Both fine-tuning and feature-based approach are tested. Proposed model is benchmarked against latest sequential labelling model designed for mutation type and location prediction. While achieving high F1 scores on validation data, both baseline and proposed model perform poorly on test data. Error and test results analysis reveal that model experience overfitting and therefore, model is deemed not suitable for splice site prediction.","created":"2022-12-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07638v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

This paper presents a method to estimate the degree of edema from facial images taken before and after dialysis of renal failure patients. As tasks to estimate the degree of edema, we perform pre- and post-dialysis classification and body weight prediction. We develop a multi-patient pre-training framework for acquiring knowledge of edema and transfer the pre-trained model to a model for each patient. For effective pre-training, we propose a novel contrastive representation learning, called weight-aware supervised momentum contrast (WeightSupMoCo). WeightSupMoCo aims to make feature representations of facial images closer in similarity of patient weight when the pre- and post-dialysis labels are the same. Experimental results show that our pre-training approach improves the accuracy of pre- and post-dialysis classification by 15.1% and reduces the mean absolute error of weight prediction by 0.243 kg compared with training from scratch. The proposed method accurately estimate the degree of edema from facial images; our edema estimation system could thus be beneficial to dialysis patients.","created":"2022-12-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07582v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

LLM errors differ systematically from human errors in ways that make it easy to craft adversarial examples, or even perturb existing examples to flip the output label. We also observe signs of inverse scaling with model size on some examples, and show that prompting models to \"explain their reasoning\" often leads to alarming justifications of unethical actions.

{"title":"SRoUDA: Meta Self-training for Robust Unsupervised Domain Adaptation","abstract":"As acquiring manual labels on data could be costly, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which transfers knowledge learned from a rich-label dataset to the unlabeled target dataset, is gaining increasing popularity. While extensive studies have been devoted to improving the model accuracy on target domain, an important issue of model robustness is neglected. To make things worse, conventional adversarial training (AT) methods for improving model robustness are inapplicable under UDA scenario since they train models on adversarial examples that are generated by supervised loss function. In this paper, we present a new meta self-training pipeline, named SRoUDA, for improving adversarial robustness of UDA models. Based on self-training paradigm, SRoUDA starts with pre-training a source model by applying UDA baseline on source labeled data and taraget unlabeled data with a developed random masked augmentation (RMA), and then alternates between adversarial target model training on pseudo-labeled target data and finetuning source model by a meta step. While self-training allows the direct incorporation of AT in UDA, the meta step in SRoUDA further helps in mitigating error propagation from noisy pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SRoUDA where it achieves significant model robustness improvement without harming clean accuracy.

{"title":"KonX: Cross-Resolution Image Quality Assessment","abstract":"Scale-invariance is an open problem in many computer vision subfields. For example, object labels should remain constant across scales, yet model predictions diverge in many cases. This problem gets harder for tasks where the ground-truth labels change with the presentation scale. In image quality assessment (IQA), downsampling attenuates impairments, e.g., blurs or compression artifacts, which can positively affect the impression evoked in subjective studies. To accurately predict perceptual image quality, cross-resolution IQA methods must therefore account for resolution-dependent errors induced by model inadequacies as well as for the perceptual label shifts in the ground truth. We present the first study of its kind that disentangles and examines the two issues separately via KonX, a novel, carefully crafted cross-resolution IQA database. This paper contributes the following: 1. Through KonX, we provide empirical evidence of label shifts caused by changes in the presentation resolution. 2. We show that objective IQA methods have a scale bias, which reduces their predictive performance. 3. We propose a multi-scale and multi-column DNN architecture that improves performance over previous state-of-the-art IQA models for this task, including recent transformers. We thus both raise and address a novel research problem in image quality assessment.","created":"2022-12-12","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05813v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"MountNet: Learning an Inertial Sensor Mounting Angle with Deep Neural Networks","abstract":"Finding the mounting angle of a smartphone inside a car is crucial for navigation, motion detection, activity recognition, and other applications. It is a challenging task in several aspects: (i) the mounting angle at the drive start is unknown and may differ significantly between users; (ii) the user, or bad fixture, may change the mounting angle while driving; (iii) a rapid and computationally efficient real-time solution is required for most applications. To tackle these problems, a data-driven approach using deep neural networks (DNNs) is presented to learn the yaw mounting angle of a smartphone equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and strapped to a car. The proposed model, MountNet, uses only IMU readings as input and, in contrast to existing solutions, does not require inputs from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). IMU data is collected for training and validation with the sensor mounted at a known yaw mounting angle and a range of ground truth labels is generated by applying a prescribed rotation to the measurements. Although the training data did not include recordings with real sensor rotations, tests on data with real and synthetic rotations show similar results. An algorithm is formulated for real-time deployment to detect and smooth transitions in device mounting angle estimated by MountNet. MountNet is shown to find the mounting angle rapidly which is critical in real-time applications. Our method converges in less than 30 seconds of driving to a mean error of 4 degrees allowing a fast calibration phase for other algorithms and applications. When the device is rotated in the middle of a drive, large changes converge in 5 seconds and small changes converge in less than 30 seconds.","created":"2022-12-10","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11120v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation for Large-Scale Point Cloud","abstract":"Existing methods for large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation require expensive, tedious and error-prone manual point-wise annotations. Intuitively, weakly supervised training is a direct solution to reduce the cost of labeling. However, for weakly supervised large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation, too few annotations will inevitably lead to ineffective learning of network. We propose an effective weakly supervised method containing two components to solve the above problem. Firstly, we construct a pretext task, \\textit{i.e.,} point cloud colorization, with a self-supervised learning to transfer the learned prior knowledge from a large amount of unlabeled point cloud to a weakly supervised network. In this way, the representation capability of the weakly supervised network can be improved by the guidance from a heterogeneous task. Besides, to generate pseudo label for unlabeled data, a sparse label propagation mechanism is proposed with the help of generated class prototypes, which is used to measure the classification confidence of unlabeled point. Our method is evaluated on large-scale point cloud datasets with different scenarios including indoor and outdoor. The experimental results show the large gain against existing weakly supervised and comparable results to fully supervised methods\\footnote{Code based on mindspore: https://github.com/dmcv-ecnu/MindSpore\\_ModelZoo/tree/main/WS3\\_MindSpore}.","created":"2022-12-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04744v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Most existing methods utilize the off-the-shelf pose or parsing networks as pseudo labels, which are prone to error. To address these issues, we propose a novel Occlusion Correction Network (OCNet) that corrects features through relational-weight learning and obtains diverse and representative features without using external networks. In addition, we present a simple concept of a center feature in order to provide an intuitive solution to pedestrian occlusion scenarios. Furthermore, we suggest the idea of Separation Loss (SL) for focusing on different parts between global features and part features.

{"title":"Decorate the Newcomers: Visual Domain Prompt for Continual Test Time Adaptation","abstract":"Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to adapt the source model to continually changing unlabeled target domains without access to the source data. Existing methods mainly focus on model-based adaptation in a self-training manner, such as predicting pseudo labels for new domain datasets. Since pseudo labels are noisy and unreliable, these methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation when dealing with dynamic data distributions. Motivated by the prompt learning in NLP, in this paper, we propose to learn an image-level visual domain prompt for target domains while having the source model parameters frozen. During testing, the changing target datasets can be adapted to the source model by reformulating the input data with the learned visual prompts. Specifically, we devise two types of prompts, i.e., domains-specific prompts and domains-agnostic prompts, to extract current domain knowledge and maintain the domain-shared knowledge in the continual adaptation. Furthermore, we design a homeostasis-based prompt adaptation strategy to suppress domain-sensitive parameters in domain-invariant prompts to learn domain-shared knowledge more effectively. This transition from the model-dependent paradigm to the model-free one enables us to bypass the catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation problems. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used benchmarks, including CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-C, and VLCS datasets.","created":"2022-12-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04145v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Utility-Based Communication Requirements for Stable Matching in Large Markets","abstract":"Results from the communication complexity literature have demonstrated that stable matching requires communication: one cannot find or verify a stable match without having access to essentially all of the ordinal preference information held privately by the agents in the market. Stated differently, these results show that stable matching mechanisms are not robust to even a small number of labeled inaccuracies in the input preferences. In practice, these results indicate that agents must go through the time-intensive process of accurately ranking each and every potential match candidate if they wish for the resulting match to be guaranteedly stable. Thus, in large markets, communication requirements for stable matching may be impractically high.   A natural question to ask, given this result, is whether some higher-order structure in the market can indicate which large markets have steeper communication requirements. In this paper, we perform such an analysis in a regime where agents have a utility-based notion of preference. We consider a dynamic model where agents only have access to an approximation of their utility that satisfies a universal multiplicative error bound. We apply guarantees from the theoretical computer science literature on low-distortion embeddings of finite metric spaces to understand the communication requirements of stable matching in large markets in terms of their structural properties. Our results show that for a broad family of markets, the error bound may not grow faster than $n^2\\log(n)$ while maintaining a deterministic guarantee on the behavior of stable matching mechanisms in the limit. We also show that a stronger probabilistic guarantee may be made so long as the bound grows at most logarithmically in the underlying topological complexity of the market.","created":"2022-12-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04024v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

We propose circumventing this issue by directly finding latent knowledge inside the internal activations of a language model in a purely unsupervised way. Specifically, we introduce a method for accurately answering yes-no questions given only unlabeled model activations. It works by finding a direction in activation space that satisfies logical consistency properties, such as that a statement and its negation have opposite truth values. We show that despite using no supervision and no model outputs, our method can recover diverse knowledge represented in large language models: across 6 models and 10 question-answering datasets, it outperforms zero-shot accuracy by 4\\% on average. We also find that it cuts prompt sensitivity in half and continues to maintain high accuracy even when models are prompted to generate incorrect answers. Our results provide an initial step toward discovering what language models know, distinct from what they say, even when we don't have access to explicit ground truth labels.","created":"2022-12-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Existing approaches for SFDA focus on self-training usually including well-established entropy minimization techniques. One of the main challenges in SFDA is to reduce accumulation of errors caused by domain misalignment. A recent strategy successfully managed to reduce error accumulation by pseudo-labeling the target samples based on class-wise prototypes (centroids) generated by their clustering in the representation space. However, this strategy also creates cases for which the cross-entropy of a pseudo-label and the minimum entropy have a conflict in their objectives. We call this conflict the centroid-hypothesis conflict. We propose to reconcile this conflict by aligning the entropy minimization objective with that of the pseudo labels' cross entropy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of aligning the two loss objectives on three domain adaptation datasets.

{"title":"An Intuitive and Unconstrained 2D Cube Representation for Simultaneous Head Detection and Pose Estimation","abstract":"Most recent head pose estimation (HPE) methods are dominated by the Euler angle representation. To avoid its inherent ambiguity problem of rotation labels, alternative quaternion-based and vector-based representations are introduced. However, they both are not visually intuitive, and often derived from equivocal Euler angle labels. In this paper, we present a novel single-stage keypoint-based method via an {\\it intuitive} and {\\it unconstrained} 2D cube representation for joint head detection and pose estimation. The 2D cube is an orthogonal projection of the 3D regular hexahedron label roughly surrounding one head, and itself contains the head location. It can reflect the head orientation straightforwardly and unambiguously in any rotation angle. Unlike the general 6-DoF object pose estimation, our 2D cube ignores the 3-DoF of head size but retains the 3-DoF of head pose. Based on the prior of equal side length, we can effortlessly obtain the closed-form solution of Euler angles from predicted 2D head cube instead of applying the error-prone PnP algorithm. In experiments, our proposed method achieves comparable results with other representative methods on the public AFLW2000 and BIWI datasets. Besides, a novel test on the CMU panoptic dataset shows that our method can be seamlessly adapted to the unconstrained full-view HPE task without modification.","created":"2022-12-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03623v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Conventional research mainly focuses on developing methods for the extraction and registration tasks separately under supervised settings. The performance of these methods highly depends on the amount of training samples and visual inspections performed by experts for error correction. However, in many medical studies, collecting voxel-level labels and conducting manual quality control in high-dimensional neuroimages (e.g., 3D MRI) are very expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, brain extraction and registration are highly related tasks in neuroimaging data and should be solved collectively.

We test the pseudo-labelling method on the problems of estimating redshift, stellar mass, and star formation rate, using COSMOS2015 broad band photometry and one of several publicly available machine learning algorithms, and we obtain significant improvements compared to purely supervised learning. We find that the gradient-boosting tree methods CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM benefit the most, with reductions of up to ~15% in metrics of absolute error.

{"title":"A Transformer-Based User Satisfaction Prediction for Proactive Interaction Mechanism in DuerOS","abstract":"Recently, spoken dialogue systems have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, serving a huge number of end-users. A common issue is that the errors resulting from noisy utterances, semantic misunderstandings, or lack of knowledge make it hard for a real system to respond properly, possibly leading to an unsatisfactory user experience. To avoid such a case, we consider a proactive interaction mechanism where the system predicts the user satisfaction with the candidate response before giving it to the user. If the user is not likely to be satisfied according to the prediction, the system will ask the user a suitable question to determine the real intent of the user instead of providing the response directly. With such an interaction with the user, the system can give a better response to the user. Previous models that predict the user satisfaction are not applicable to DuerOS which is a large-scale commercial dialogue system. They are based on hand-crafted features and thus can hardly learn the complex patterns lying behind millions of conversations and temporal dependency in multiple turns of the conversation. Moreover, they are trained and evaluated on the benchmark datasets with adequate labels, which are expensive to obtain in a commercial dialogue system. To face these challenges, we propose a pipeline to predict the user satisfaction to help DuerOS decide whether to ask for clarification in each turn. Specifically, we propose to first generate a large number of weak labels and then train a transformer-based model to predict the user satisfaction with these weak labels. Empirically, we deploy and evaluate our model on DuerOS, and observe a 19% relative improvement on the accuracy of user satisfaction prediction and 2.3% relative improvement on user experience.","created":"2022-12-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03817v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Moreover, selecting small-loss samples can also cause error accumulation as once the noisy samples are mistakenly selected as small-loss samples, they are more likely to be selected again. In this paper, we try to deal with error accumulation in noisy label learning from both model and data perspectives. We introduce mean point ensemble to utilize a more robust loss function and more information from unselected samples to reduce error accumulation from the model perspective. Furthermore, as the flip images have the same semantic meaning as the original images, we select small-loss samples according to the loss values of flip images instead of the original ones to reduce error accumulation from the data perspective. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and large-scale Clothing1M show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art noisy label learning methods with different levels of label noise. Our method can also be seamlessly combined with other noisy label learning methods to further improve their performance and generalize well to other tasks.

{"title":"AGRO: Adversarial Discovery of Error-prone groups for Robust Optimization","abstract":"Models trained via empirical risk minimization (ERM) are known to rely on spurious correlations between labels and task-independent input features, resulting in poor generalization to distributional shifts. Group distributionally robust optimization (G-DRO) can alleviate this problem by minimizing the worst-case loss over a set of pre-defined groups over training data. G-DRO successfully improves performance of the worst-group, where the correlation does not hold. However, G-DRO assumes that the spurious correlations and associated worst groups are known in advance, making it challenging to apply it to new tasks with potentially multiple unknown spurious correlations. We propose AGRO -- Adversarial Group discovery for Distributionally Robust Optimization -- an end-to-end approach that jointly identifies error-prone groups and improves accuracy on them. AGRO equips G-DRO with an adversarial slicing model to find a group assignment for training examples which maximizes worst-case loss over the discovered groups. On the WILDS benchmark, AGRO results in 8% higher model performance on average on known worst-groups, compared to prior group discovery approaches used with G-DRO. AGRO also improves out-of-distribution performance on SST2, QQP, and MS-COCO -- datasets where potential spurious correlations are as yet uncharacterized. Human evaluation of ARGO groups shows that they contain well-defined, yet previously unstudied spurious correlations that lead to model errors.","created":"2022-12-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00921v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Improving Zero-Shot Models with Label Distribution Priors","abstract":"Labeling large image datasets with attributes such as facial age or object type is tedious and sometimes infeasible. Supervised machine learning methods provide a highly accurate solution, but require manual labels which are often unavailable. Zero-shot models (e.g., CLIP) do not require manual labels but are not as accurate as supervised ones, particularly when the attribute is numeric. We propose a new approach, CLIPPR (CLIP with Priors), which adapts zero-shot models for regression and classification on unlabelled datasets. Our method does not use any annotated images. Instead, we assume a prior over the label distribution in the dataset. We then train an adapter network on top of CLIP under two competing objectives: i) minimal change of predictions from the original CLIP model ii) minimal distance between predicted and prior distribution of labels. Additionally, we present a novel approach for selecting prompts for Vision & Language models using a distributional prior. Our method is effective and presents a significant improvement over the original model. We demonstrate an improvement of 28% in mean absolute error on the UTK age regression task. We also present promising results for classification benchmarks, improving the classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset by 2.83%, without using any labels.","created":"2022-12-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00784v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Purifier: Defending Data Inference Attacks via Transforming Confidence Scores","abstract":"Neural networks are susceptible to data inference attacks such as the membership inference attack, the adversarial model inversion attack and the attribute inference attack, where the attacker could infer useful information such as the membership, the reconstruction or the sensitive attributes of a data sample from the confidence scores predicted by the target classifier. In this paper, we propose a method, namely PURIFIER, to defend against membership inference attacks. It transforms the confidence score vectors predicted by the target classifier and makes purified confidence scores indistinguishable in individual shape, statistical distribution and prediction label between members and non-members. The experimental results show that PURIFIER helps defend membership inference attacks with high effectiveness and efficiency, outperforming previous defense methods, and also incurs negligible utility loss. Besides, our further experiments show that PURIFIER is also effective in defending adversarial model inversion attacks and attribute inference attacks. For example, the inversion error is raised about 4+ times on the Facescrub530 classifier, and the attribute inference accuracy drops significantly when PURIFIER is deployed in our experiment.","created":"2022-12-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00612v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Direct-Effect Risk Minimization for Domain Generalization","abstract":"We study the problem of out-of-distribution (o.o.d.) generalization where spurious correlations of attributes vary across training and test domains. This is known as the problem of correlation shift and has posed concerns on the reliability of machine learning. In this work, we introduce the concepts of direct and indirect effects from causal inference to the domain generalization problem. We argue that models that learn direct effects minimize the worst-case risk across correlation-shifted domains. To eliminate the indirect effects, our algorithm consists of two stages: in the first stage, we learn an indirect-effect representation by minimizing the prediction error of domain labels using the representation and the class labels; in the second stage, we remove the indirect effects learned in the first stage by matching each data with another data of similar indirect-effect representation but of different class labels in the training and validation phase. Our approach is shown to be compatible with existing methods and improve the generalization performance of them on correlation-shifted datasets. Experiments on 5 correlation-shifted datasets and the DomainBed benchmark verify the effectiveness of our approach.","created":"2022-11-26","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14594v4","tag":"data-quality"}}

When moving beyond prompting, this raises the question of how we should supervise such models: outcome-based approaches which supervise the final result, or process-based approaches which supervise the reasoning process itself? Differences between these approaches might naturally be expected not just in final-answer errors but also in reasoning errors, which can be difficult to detect and are problematic in many real-world domains such as education. We run the first comprehensive comparison between process- and outcome-based approaches trained on a natural language task, GSM8K. We find that pure outcome-based supervision produces similar final-answer error rates with less label supervision. However, for correct reasoning steps we find it necessary to use process-based supervision or supervision from learned reward models that emulate process-based feedback. In total, we improve the previous best results from 16.8% $\\to$ 12.7% final-answer error and 14.0% $\\to$ 3.4% reasoning error among final-answer-correct solutions.","created":"2022-11-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14275v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Combating noisy labels in object detection datasets","abstract":"The quality of training datasets for deep neural networks is a key factor contributing to the accuracy of resulting models. This is even more important in difficult tasks such as object detection. Dealing with errors in these datasets was in the past limited to accepting that some fraction of examples is incorrect or predicting their confidence and assigning appropriate weights during training. In this work, we propose a different approach. For the first time, we extended the confident learning algorithm to the object detection task. By focusing on finding incorrect labels in the original training datasets, we can eliminate erroneous examples in their root. Suspicious bounding boxes can be re-annotated in order to improve the quality of the dataset itself, thus leading to better models without complicating their already complex architectures. We can effectively point out 99\\% of artificially disturbed bounding boxes with FPR below 0.3.

Example applications include image (or document) tagging where each possible tag either applies to a particular image (or document) or not. With many possible classes to consider, data annotators are likely to make errors when labeling such data in practice. Here we consider algorithms for finding mislabeled examples in multi-label classification datasets. We propose an extension of the Confident Learning framework to this setting, as well as a label quality score that ranks examples with label errors much higher than those which are correctly labeled. Both approaches can utilize any trained classifier. After demonstrating that our methodology empirically outperforms other algorithms for label error detection, we apply our approach to discover many label errors in the CelebA image tagging dataset.","created":"2022-11-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13895v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Cross-domain Transfer of defect features in technical domains based on partial target data","abstract":"A common challenge in real world classification scenarios with sequentially appending target domain data is insufficient training datasets during the training phase. Therefore, conventional deep learning and transfer learning classifiers are not applicable especially when individual classes are not represented or are severely underrepresented at the outset. In many technical domains, however, it is only the defect or worn reject classes that are insufficiently represented, while the non-defect class is often available from the beginning. The proposed classification approach addresses such conditions and is based on a CNN encoder. Following a contrastive learning approach, it is trained with a modified triplet loss function using two datasets: Besides the non-defective target domain class 1st dataset, a state-of-the-art labeled source domain dataset that contains highly related classes e.g., a related manufacturing error or wear defect but originates from a highly different domain e.g., different product, material, or appearance = 2nd dataset is utilized. The approach learns the classification features from the source domain dataset while at the same time learning the differences between the source and the target domain in a single training step, aiming to transfer the relevant features to the target domain. The classifier becomes sensitive to the classification features and by architecture robust against the highly domain-specific context. The approach is benchmarked in a technical and a non-technical domain and shows convincing classification results. In particular, it is shown that the domain generalization capabilities and classification results are improved by the proposed architecture, allowing for larger domain shifts between source and target domains.","created":"2022-11-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13662v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Mutual Information Learned Regressor: an Information-theoretic Viewpoint of Training Regression Systems","abstract":"As one of the central tasks in machine learning, regression finds lots of applications in different fields. An existing common practice for solving regression problems is the mean square error (MSE) minimization approach or its regularized variants which require prior knowledge about the models. Recently, Yi et al., proposed a mutual information based supervised learning framework where they introduced a label entropy regularization which does not require any prior knowledge. When applied to classification tasks and solved via a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, their approach achieved significant improvement over the commonly used cross entropy loss and its variants. However, they did not provide a theoretical convergence analysis of the SGD algorithm for the proposed formulation. Besides, applying the framework to regression tasks is nontrivial due to the potentially infinite support set of the label. In this paper, we investigate the regression under the mutual information based supervised learning framework. We first argue that the MSE minimization approach is equivalent to a conditional entropy learning problem, and then propose a mutual information learning formulation for solving regression problems by using a reparameterization technique. For the proposed formulation, we give the convergence analysis of the SGD algorithm for solving it in practice. Finally, we consider a multi-output regression data model where we derive the generalization performance lower bound in terms of the mutual information associated with the underlying data distribution. The result shows that the high dimensionality can be a bless instead of a curse, which is controlled by a threshold. We hope our work will serve as a good starting point for further research on the mutual information based regression.","created":"2022-11-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12685v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Out-of-Candidate Rectification for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation","abstract":"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation is typically inspired by class activation maps, which serve as pseudo masks with class-discriminative regions highlighted. Although tremendous efforts have been made to recall precise and complete locations for each class, existing methods still commonly suffer from the unsolicited Out-of-Candidate (OC) error predictions that not belongs to the label candidates, which could be avoidable since the contradiction with image-level class tags is easy to be detected. In this paper, we develop a group ranking-based Out-of-Candidate Rectification (OCR) mechanism in a plug-and-play fashion. Firstly, we adaptively split the semantic categories into In-Candidate (IC) and OC groups for each OC pixel according to their prior annotation correlation and posterior prediction correlation. Then, we derive a differentiable rectification loss to force OC pixels to shift to the IC group. Incorporating our OCR with seminal baselines (e.g., AffinityNet, SEAM, MCTformer), we can achieve remarkable performance gains on both Pascal VOC (+3.2%, +3.3%, +0.8% mIoU) and MS COCO (+1.0%, +1.3%, +0.5% mIoU) datasets with negligible extra training overhead, which justifies the effectiveness and generality of our OCR.","created":"2022-11-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12268v3","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"A Scope Sensitive and Result Attentive Model for Multi-Intent Spoken Language Understanding","abstract":"Multi-Intent Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), a novel and more complex scenario of SLU, is attracting increasing attention. Unlike traditional SLU, each intent in this scenario has its specific scope. Semantic information outside the scope even hinders the prediction, which tremendously increases the difficulty of intent detection. More seriously, guiding slot filling with these inaccurate intent labels suffers error propagation problems, resulting in unsatisfied overall performance. To solve these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Scope-Sensitive Result Attention Network (SSRAN) based on Transformer, which contains a Scope Recognizer (SR) and a Result Attention Network (RAN). Scope Recognizer assignments scope information to each token, reducing the distraction of out-of-scope tokens. Result Attention Network effectively utilizes the bidirectional interaction between results of slot filling and intent detection, mitigating the error propagation problem.

{"title":"Uncertainty-aware Vision-based Metric Cross-view Geolocalization","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel method for vision-based metric cross-view geolocalization (CVGL) that matches the camera images captured from a ground-based vehicle with an aerial image to determine the vehicle's geo-pose. Since aerial images are globally available at low cost, they represent a potential compromise between two established paradigms of autonomous driving, i.e. using expensive high-definition prior maps or relying entirely on the sensor data captured at runtime.   We present an end-to-end differentiable model that uses the ground and aerial images to predict a probability distribution over possible vehicle poses. We combine multiple vehicle datasets with aerial images from orthophoto providers on which we demonstrate the feasibility of our method. Since the ground truth poses are often inaccurate w.r.t. the aerial images, we implement a pseudo-label approach to produce more accurate ground truth poses and make them publicly available.   While previous works require training data from the target region to achieve reasonable localization accuracy (i.e. same-area evaluation), our approach overcomes this limitation and outperforms previous results even in the strictly more challenging cross-area case. We improve the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin even without ground or aerial data from the test region, which highlights the model's potential for global-scale application. We further integrate the uncertainty-aware predictions in a tracking framework to determine the vehicle's trajectory over time resulting in a mean position error on KITTI-360 of 0.78m.","created":"2022-11-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12145v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this paper, we propose UpCycling, a novel SSL framework for 3D object detection with zero additional raw-level point cloud: learning from unlabeled de-identified intermediate features (i.e., smashed data) to preserve privacy. Since these intermediate features are naturally produced by the inference pipeline, no additional computation is required on autonomous vehicles. However, generating effective consistency loss for unlabeled feature-level scene turns out to be a critical challenge. The latest SSL frameworks for 3D object detection that enforce consistency regularization between different augmentations of an unlabeled raw-point scene become detrimental when applied to intermediate features. To solve the problem, we introduce a novel combination of hybrid pseudo labels and feature-level Ground Truth sampling (F-GT), which safely augments unlabeled multi-type 3D scene features and provides high-quality supervision. We implement UpCycling on two representative 3D object detection models: SECOND-IoU and PV-RCNN. Experiments on widely-used datasets (Waymo, KITTI, and Lyft) verify that UpCycling outperforms other augmentation methods applied at the feature level. In addition, while preserving privacy, UpCycling performs better or comparably to the state-of-the-art methods that utilize raw-level unlabeled data in both domain adaptation and partial-label scenarios.","created":"2022-11-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11950v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"An Optimal k Nearest Neighbours Ensemble for Classification Based on Extended Neighbourhood Rule with Features subspace","abstract":"To minimize the effect of outliers, kNN ensembles identify a set of closest observations to a new sample point to estimate its unknown class by using majority voting in the labels of the training instances in the neighbourhood. Ordinary kNN based procedures determine k closest training observations in the neighbourhood region (enclosed by a sphere) by using a distance formula. The k nearest neighbours procedure may not work in a situation where sample points in the test data follow the pattern of the nearest observations that lie on a certain path not contained in the given sphere of nearest neighbours. Furthermore, these methods combine hundreds of base kNN learners and many of them might have high classification errors thereby resulting in poor ensembles. To overcome these problems, an optimal extended neighbourhood rule based ensemble is proposed where the neighbours are determined in k steps. It starts from the first nearest sample point to the unseen observation. The second nearest data point is identified that is closest to the previously selected data point. This process is continued until the required number of the k observations are obtained. Each base model in the ensemble is constructed on a bootstrap sample in conjunction with a random subset of features. After building a sufficiently large number of base models, the optimal models are then selected based on their performance on out-of-bag (OOB) data.","created":"2022-11-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11278v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Recently, approaches to learning a traversability estimation from past driving experiences in a self-supervised manner are arising as they can significantly reduce human labeling costs and labeling errors. However, the self-supervised data only provide supervision for the actually traversed regions, inducing epistemic uncertainty according to the scarcity of negative information. Negative data are rarely harvested as the system can be severely damaged while logging the data. To mitigate the uncertainty, we introduce a deep metric learning-based method to incorporate unlabeled data with a few positive and negative prototypes in order to leverage the uncertainty, which jointly learns using semantic segmentation and traversability regression. To firmly evaluate the proposed framework, we introduce a new evaluation metric that comprehensively evaluates the segmentation and regression.

We adopt the overparameterization perspective -- featuring interpolation of the training data (i.e., approximately zero train error) and the double descent phenomenon -- to explain the delicate effect of the transfer learning setting on generalization performance. We study how the generalization behavior of transfer learning is affected by the dataset size in the source and target tasks, the number of transferred layers that are kept frozen in the target DNN training, and the similarity between the source and target tasks. We show that the test error evolution during the target DNN training has a more significant double descent effect when the target training dataset is sufficiently large with some label noise. In addition, a larger source training dataset can delay the arrival to interpolation and double descent peak in the target DNN training. Moreover, we demonstrate that the number of frozen layers can determine whether the transfer learning is effectively underparameterized or overparameterized and, in turn, this may affect the relative success or failure of learning. Specifically, we show that too many frozen layers may make a transfer from a less related source task better or on par with a transfer from a more related source task; we call this case overfreezing.

LA methods estimate true labels from crowdsourced labels by modeling worker qualities. Most existing LA methods are iterative in nature. They need to traverse all the crowdsourced labels multiple times in order to jointly and iteratively update true labels and worker qualities until convergence. Consequently, these methods have high space and time complexities. In this paper, we treat LA as a dynamic system and model it as a Dynamic Bayesian network. From the dynamic model we derive two light-weight algorithms, LA\\textsuperscript{onepass} and LA\\textsuperscript{twopass}, which can effectively and efficiently estimate worker qualities and true labels by traversing all the labels at most twice. Due to the dynamic nature, the proposed algorithms can also estimate true labels online without re-visiting historical data. We theoretically prove the convergence property of the proposed algorithms, and bound the error of estimated worker qualities. We also analyze the space and time complexities of the proposed algorithms and show that they are equivalent to those of majority voting. Experiments conducted on 20 real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can effectively and efficiently aggregate labels in both offline and online settings even if they traverse all the labels at most twice.","created":"2022-11-19","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00007v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

To overcome the disadvantages, we reformulate overlapped speaker diarization task as a single-label prediction problem via the proposed power set encoding (PSE). Through this formulation, speaker dependency and overlaps can be explicitly modeled. To fully leverage this formulation, we further propose the speaker overlap-aware neural diarization (SOND) model, which consists of a context-independent (CI) scorer to model global speaker discriminability, a context-dependent scorer (CD) to model local discriminability, and a speaker combining network (SCN) to combine and reassign speaker activities. Experimental results show that using the proposed formulation can outperform the state-of-the-art methods based on target speaker voice activity detection, and the performance can be further improved with SOND, resulting in a 6.30% relative diarization error reduction.","created":"2022-11-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10243v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Our analysis shows that, firstly, when the amount of unlabeled data tends to infinity, the pseudo label based semi-supervised learning algorithm can obtain model which have the same generalization error upper bound as model obtained by normally training in the condition of the amount of labeled data tends to infinity. More importantly, we prove that when the amount of unlabeled data is large enough, the generalization error upper bound of the model obtained by pseudo label based semi-supervised learning algorithm can converge to the optimal upper bound with linear convergence rate.

{"title":"Contrastive Knowledge Graph Error Detection","abstract":"Knowledge Graph (KG) errors introduce non-negligible noise, severely affecting KG-related downstream tasks. Detecting errors in KGs is challenging since the patterns of errors are unknown and diverse, while ground-truth labels are rare or even unavailable. A traditional solution is to construct logical rules to verify triples, but it is not generalizable since different KGs have distinct rules with domain knowledge involved. Recent studies focus on designing tailored detectors or ranking triples based on KG embedding loss. However, they all rely on negative samples for training, which are generated by randomly replacing the head or tail entity of existing triples. Such a negative sampling strategy is not enough for prototyping practical KG errors, e.g., (Bruce_Lee, place_of_birth, China), in which the three elements are often relevant, although mismatched. We desire a more effective unsupervised learning mechanism tailored for KG error detection. To this end, we propose a novel framework - ContrAstive knowledge Graph Error Detection (CAGED). It introduces contrastive learning into KG learning and provides a novel way of modeling KG. Instead of following the traditional setting, i.e., considering entities as nodes and relations as semantic edges, CAGED augments a KG into different hyper-views, by regarding each relational triple as a node.

{"title":"Step Counting with Attention-based LSTM","abstract":"Physical activity is recognized as an essential component of overall health. One measure of physical activity, the step count, is well known as a predictor of long-term morbidity and mortality. Step Counting (SC) is the automated counting of the number of steps an individual takes over a specified period of time and space. Due to the ubiquity of smartphones and smartwatches, most current SC approaches rely on the built-in accelerometer sensors on these devices. The sensor signals are analyzed as multivariate time series, and the number of steps is calculated through a variety of approaches, such as time-domain, frequency-domain, machine-learning, and deep-learning approaches. Most of the existing approaches rely on dividing the input signal into windows, detecting steps in each window, and summing the detected steps. However, these approaches require the determination of multiple parameters, including the window size. Furthermore, most of the existing deep-learning SC approaches require ground-truth labels for every single step, which can be arduous and time-consuming to annotate. To circumvent these requirements, we present a novel SC approach utilizing many-to-one attention-based LSTM. With the proposed LSTM network, SC is solved as a regression problem, taking the entire sensor signal as input and the step count as the output. The analysis shows that the attention-based LSTM automatically learned the pattern of steps even in the absence of ground-truth labels. The experimental results on three publicly available SC datasets demonstrate that the proposed method successfully counts the number of steps with low values of mean absolute error and high values of SC accuracy.","created":"2022-11-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13114v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Contrastive Credibility Propagation for Reliable Semi-Supervised Learning","abstract":"Inferencing unlabeled data from labeled data is an error-prone process. Conventional neural network training is highly sensitive to supervision errors. These two realities make semi-supervised learning (SSL) troublesome. In practice, SSL approaches often fail to outperform their fully supervised baseline. Proposed is a novel framework for deep SSL via transductive pseudo-label refinement called Contrastive Credibility Propagation (CCP). Through an iterative process of refining soft pseudo-labels, CCP unifies a novel contrastive approach for generating pseudo-labels and a powerful technique to overcome instance-dependent label noise. The result is an SSL classification framework explicitly designed to overcome inevitable pseudo-label errors. Using standard text and image benchmark classification datasets, we show CCP reliably boosts or matches performance over a supervised baseline in four common real-world SSL scenarios: few-label, open-set, noisy-label, and class distribution misalignment.","created":"2022-11-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09929v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Data-Centric Debugging: mitigating model failures via targeted data collection","abstract":"Deep neural networks can be unreliable in the real world when the training set does not adequately cover all the settings where they are deployed. Focusing on image classification, we consider the setting where we have an error distribution $\\mathcal{E}$ representing a deployment scenario where the model fails. We have access to a small set of samples $\\mathcal{E}_{sample}$ from $\\mathcal{E}$ and it can be expensive to obtain additional samples. In the traditional model development framework, mitigating failures of the model in $\\mathcal{E}$ can be challenging and is often done in an ad hoc manner. In this paper, we propose a general methodology for model debugging that can systemically improve model performance on $\\mathcal{E}$ while maintaining its performance on the original test set. Our key assumption is that we have access to a large pool of weakly (noisily) labeled data $\\mathcal{F}$. However, naively adding $\\mathcal{F}$ to the training would hurt model performance due to the large extent of label noise. Our Data-Centric Debugging (DCD) framework carefully creates a debug-train set by selecting images from $\\mathcal{F}$ that are perceptually similar to the images in $\\mathcal{E}_{sample}$. To do this, we use the $\\ell_2$ distance in the feature space (penultimate layer activations) of various models including ResNet, Robust ResNet and DINO where we observe DINO ViTs are significantly better at discovering similar images compared to Resnets. Compared to LPIPS, we find that our method reduces compute and storage requirements by 99.58\\%. Compared to the baselines that maintain model performance on the test set, we achieve significantly (+9.45\\%) improved results on the debug-heldout sets.","created":"2022-11-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09859v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Unsupervised Model-based speaker adaptation of end-to-end lattice-free MMI model for speech recognition","abstract":"Modeling the speaker variability is a key challenge for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In this paper, the learning hidden unit contributions (LHUC) based adaptation techniques with compact speaker dependent (SD) parameters are used to facilitate both speaker adaptive training (SAT) and unsupervised test-time speaker adaptation for end-to-end (E2E) lattice-free MMI (LF-MMI) models. An unsupervised model-based adaptation framework is proposed to estimate the SD parameters in E2E paradigm using LF-MMI and cross entropy (CE) criterions. Various regularization methods of the standard LHUC adaptation, e.g., the Bayesian LHUC (BLHUC) adaptation, are systematically investigated to mitigate the risk of overfitting, on E2E LF-MMI CNN-TDNN and CNN-TDNN-BLSTM models. Lattice-based confidence score estimation is used for adaptation data selection to reduce the supervision label uncertainty. Experiments on the 300-hour Switchboard task suggest that applying BLHUC in the proposed unsupervised E2E adaptation framework to byte pair encoding (BPE) based E2E LF-MMI systems consistently outperformed the baseline systems by relative word error rate (WER) reductions up to 10.5% and 14.7% on the NIST Hub5'00 and RT03 evaluation sets, and achieved the best performance in WERs of 9.0% and 9.7%, respectively.

{"title":"Region Proposal Network Pre-Training Helps Label-Efficient Object Detection","abstract":"Self-supervised pre-training, based on the pretext task of instance discrimination, has fueled the recent advance in label-efficient object detection. However, existing studies focus on pre-training only a feature extractor network to learn transferable representations for downstream detection tasks. This leads to the necessity of training multiple detection-specific modules from scratch in the fine-tuning phase. We argue that the region proposal network (RPN), a common detection-specific module, can additionally be pre-trained towards reducing the localization error of multi-stage detectors. In this work, we propose a simple pretext task that provides an effective pre-training for the RPN, towards efficiently improving downstream object detection performance. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on benchmark object detection tasks and additional downstream tasks, including instance segmentation and few-shot detection. In comparison with multi-stage detectors without RPN pre-training, our approach is able to consistently improve downstream task performance, with largest gains found in label-scarce settings.","created":"2022-11-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09022v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"A Basic Algorithm for Generating Individualized Numerical Scale (BAGINS)","abstract":"Linguistic labels are effective means of expressing qualitative assessments because they account for the uncertain nature of human preferences. However, to perform computations with linguistic labels, they must first be converted to numbers using a scale function. Within the context of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the most popular scale used to represent linguistic labels numerically is the linear 1-9 scale, which was proposed by Saaty. However, this scale has been criticized by several researchers, and various alternatives are proposed in the literature. There is a growing interest in scale individualization rather than relying on a generic fixed scale since the perceptions of the decision maker regarding these linguistic labels are highly subjective. The methods proposed in the literature for scale individualization focus on minimizing the transitivity errors, i.e., consistency. In this research, we proposed a novel, easy-to-learn, easy-to-implement, and computationally less demanding scale individualization approach based on compatibility. We also developed an experimental setup and introduced two new metrics that can be used by researchers that contribute to the theory of AHP. To assess the value of scale individualization in general, and the performance of the proposed novel approach in particular, numerical and two empirical studies are conducted. The results of the analyses demonstrate that the scale individualization outperforms the conventional fixed scale approach and validates the benefit of the proposed novel heuristic.","created":"2022-11-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08740v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Type Information Utilized Event Detection via Multi-Channel GNNs in Electrical Power Systems","abstract":"Event detection in power systems aims to identify triggers and event types, which helps relevant personnel respond to emergencies promptly and facilitates the optimization of power supply strategies. However, the limited length of short electrical record texts causes severe information sparsity, and numerous domain-specific terminologies of power systems makes it difficult to transfer knowledge from language models pre-trained on general-domain texts. Traditional event detection approaches primarily focus on the general domain and ignore these two problems in the power system domain. To address the above issues, we propose a Multi-Channel graph neural network utilizing Type information for Event Detection in power systems, named MC-TED, leveraging a semantic channel and a topological channel to enrich information interaction from short texts. Concretely, the semantic channel refines textual representations with semantic similarity, building the semantic information interaction among potential event-related words. The topological channel generates a relation-type-aware graph modeling word dependencies, and a word-type-aware graph integrating part-of-speech tags. To further reduce errors worsened by professional terminologies in type analysis, a type learning mechanism is designed for updating the representations of both the word type and relation type in the topological channel. In this way, the information sparsity and professional term occurrence problems can be alleviated by enabling interaction between topological and semantic information. Furthermore, to address the lack of labeled data in power systems, we built a Chinese event detection dataset based on electrical Power Event texts, named PoE. In experiments, our model achieves compelling results not only on the PoE dataset, but on general-domain event detection datasets including ACE 2005 and MAVEN.","created":"2022-11-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08168v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"An Automatic ICD Coding Network Using Partition-Based Label Attention","abstract":"International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a global medical classification system which provides unique codes for diagnoses and procedures appropriate to a patient's clinical record. However, manual coding by human coders is expensive and error-prone. Automatic ICD coding has the potential to solve this problem. With the advancement of deep learning technologies, many deep learning-based methods for automatic ICD coding are being developed. In particular, a label attention mechanism is effective for multi-label classification, i.e., the ICD coding. It effectively obtains the label-specific representations from the input clinical records. However, because the existing label attention mechanism finds key tokens in the entire text at once, the important information dispersed in each paragraph may be omitted from the attention map. To overcome this, we propose a novel neural network architecture composed of two parts of encoders and two kinds of label attention layers. The input text is segmentally encoded in the former encoder and integrated by the follower. Then, the conventional and partition-based label attention mechanisms extract important global and local feature representations. Our classifier effectively integrates them to enhance the ICD coding performance. We verified the proposed method using the MIMIC-III, a benchmark dataset of the ICD coding. Our results show that our network improves the ICD coding performance based on the partition-based mechanism.","created":"2022-11-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08429v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

While existing studies focus on FL algorithm development to tackle data heterogeneity across clients, the important issue of data quality (e.g., label noise) in FL is overlooked. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a quantitative study on the impact of label noise on FL. We derive an upper bound for the generalization error that is linear in the clients' label noise level. Then we conduct experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using various FL algorithms. Our empirical results show that the global model accuracy linearly decreases as the noise level increases, which is consistent with our theoretical analysis. We further find that label noise slows down the convergence of FL training, and the global model tends to overfit when the noise level is high.","created":"2022-11-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07816v7","tag":"data-quality"}}

A detailed simulation study highlights the benefits of choosing an EC distribution over the TVN for heavier-tailed data.

{"title":"Bead-Droplet Reactor for High-Fidelity Solid-Phase Enzymatic DNA Synthesis","abstract":"Solid-phase synthesis techniques underpin the synthesis of DNA, oligopeptides, oligosaccharides, and combinatorial libraries for drug discovery. State-of-the-art solid-phase synthesizers can produce oligonucleotides up to 200-300 nucleotides while using excess reagents. Accumulated errors over multiple reaction cycles prevent the synthesis of longer oligonucleotides for the genome scale engineering of synthetic biological systems. The sources of these errors in synthesis columns remains poorly understood. Here we show that bead-bead stacking significantly contributes to reaction errors in columns by analyzing enzymatic coupling of fluorescently labelled nucleotides onto the initiated beads along with porosity, particle tracking and diffusion calculations. To circumvent stacking, we introduce dielectrophoretic bead-droplet reactor (DBDR); a novel approach to synthesize on individual microbeads within microdroplets. Dielectrophoretic force overcomes the droplet-medium interfacial tension to encapsulate and eject individual beads from microdroplets in a droplet microfluidic device. Faster reagent diffusion in droplets, and non-uniform electric field induced enhancement in reagent concentration at its surface can improve reaction fidelities in DBDR. Fluorescence comparisons suggest around 3-fold enhancement of reaction fidelity compared to columns. DBDR can potentially enable the high-purity synthesis of arbitrarily long strands of DNA to meet the emerging demands in healthcare, environment, agriculture, materials, and computing.","created":"2022-11-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06799v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Sentence-Level Sign Language Recognition Framework","abstract":"We present two solutions to sentence-level SLR. Sentence-level SLR required mapping videos of sign language sentences to sequences of gloss labels. Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) has been used as the classifier level of both models. CTC is used to avoid pre-segmenting the sentences into individual words. The first model is an LRCN-based model, and the second model is a Multi-Cue Network. LRCN is a model in which a CNN as a feature extractor is applied to each frame before feeding them into an LSTM. In the first approach, no prior knowledge has been leveraged. Raw frames are fed into an 18-layer LRCN with a CTC on top. In the second approach, three main characteristics (hand shape, hand position, and hand movement information) associated with each sign have been extracted using Mediapipe. 2D landmarks of hand shape have been used to create the skeleton of the hands and then are fed to a CONV-LSTM model. Hand locations and hand positions as relative distance to head are fed to separate LSTMs. All three sources of information have been then integrated into a Multi-Cue network with a CTC classification layer. We evaluated the performance of proposed models on RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather.

{"title":"Lifelong and Continual Learning Dialogue Systems","abstract":"Dialogue systems, commonly known as chatbots, have gained escalating popularity in recent times due to their wide-spread applications in carrying out chit-chat conversations with users and task-oriented dialogues to accomplish various user tasks. Existing chatbots are usually trained from pre-collected and manually-labeled data and/or written with handcrafted rules. Many also use manually-compiled knowledge bases (KBs). Their ability to understand natural language is still limited, and they tend to produce many errors resulting in poor user satisfaction. Typically, they need to be constantly improved by engineers with more labeled data and more manually compiled knowledge. This book introduces the new paradigm of lifelong learning dialogue systems to endow chatbots the ability to learn continually by themselves through their own self-initiated interactions with their users and working environments to improve themselves. As the systems chat more and more with users or learn more and more from external sources, they become more and more knowledgeable and better and better at conversing. The book presents the latest developments and techniques for building such continual learning dialogue systems that continuously learn new language expressions and lexical and factual knowledge during conversation from users and off conversation from external sources, acquire new training examples during conversation, and learn conversational skills. Apart from these general topics, existing works on continual learning of some specific aspects of dialogue systems are also surveyed.

{"title":"Gradient Imitation Reinforcement Learning for General Low-Resource Information Extraction","abstract":"Information Extraction (IE) aims to extract structured information from heterogeneous sources. IE from natural language texts include sub-tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), and Event Extraction (EE). Most IE systems require comprehensive understandings of sentence structure, implied semantics, and domain knowledge to perform well; thus, IE tasks always need adequate external resources and annotations. However, it takes time and effort to obtain more human annotations. Low-Resource Information Extraction (LRIE) strives to use unsupervised data, reducing the required resources and human annotation. In practice, existing systems either utilize self-training schemes to generate pseudo labels that will cause the gradual drift problem, or leverage consistency regularization methods which inevitably possess confirmation bias. To alleviate confirmation bias due to the lack of feedback loops in existing LRIE learning paradigms, we develop a Gradient Imitation Reinforcement Learning (GIRL) method to encourage pseudo-labeled data to imitate the gradient descent direction on labeled data, which can force pseudo-labeled data to achieve better optimization capabilities similar to labeled data. Based on how well the pseudo-labeled data imitates the instructive gradient descent direction obtained from labeled data, we design a reward to quantify the imitation process and bootstrap the optimization capability of pseudo-labeled data through trial and error. In addition to learning paradigms, GIRL is not limited to specific sub-tasks, and we leverage GIRL to solve all IE sub-tasks (named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction) in low-resource settings (semi-supervised IE and few-shot IE).","created":"2022-11-11","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06014v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

We motivate the use of semi-supervised learning considering the fact that process quality variables are not collected at the same frequency as other process variables leading to many unlabelled records in operational datasets. These unlabelled records are not possible to use for training quality variable predictions based on supervised learning methods. Use of VAEs for unsupervised learning is well established and recently they were used for regression applications based on variational inference procedures. We extend this approach of supervised VAEs for regression (SVAER) to make it learn from unlabelled data leading to semi-supervised VAEs for regression (SSVAER), then we make further modifications to their architecture using additional regularization components to make SSVAER well suited for learning from both labelled and unlabelled process data. The probabilistic regressor resulting from the variational approach makes it possible to estimate the variance of the predictions simultaneously, which provides an uncertainty quantification along with the generated predictions. We provide an extensive comparative study of SSVAER with other publicly available semi-supervised and supervised learning methods on two benchmark problems using fixed-size datasets, where we vary the percentage of labelled data available for training.

The basic assumption of PLL is that the ground-truth label must reside in the candidate set. However, this assumption may not be satisfied due to the unprofessional judgment of the annotators, thus limiting the practical application of PLL. In this paper, we relax this assumption and focus on a more general problem, noisy PLL, where the ground-truth label may not exist in the candidate set. To address this challenging problem, we propose a novel framework called \"Iterative Refinement Network (IRNet)\". It aims to purify the noisy samples by two key modules, i.e., noisy sample detection and label correction. Ideally, we can convert noisy PLL into traditional PLL if all noisy samples are corrected. To guarantee the performance of these modules, we start with warm-up training and exploit data augmentation to reduce prediction errors. Through theoretical analysis, we prove that IRNet is able to reduce the noise level of the dataset and eventually approximate the Bayes optimal classifier. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

In this thesis, we focus on a specific area of Transfer Learning called label shift, also known as quantification. In quantification, the aforementioned discrepancy is isolated to a shift in the distribution of the response variable. In such a setting, accurately inferring the response variable's new distribution is both an important estimation task in its own right and a crucial step for ensuring that the learning algorithm can adapt to the new data. We make two contributions to this field. First, we present a new procedure called SELSE which estimates the shift in the response variable's distribution. Second, we prove that SELSE is semiparametric efficient among a large family of quantification algorithms, i.e., SELSE's normalized error has the smallest possible asymptotic variance matrix compared to any other algorithm in that family. This family includes nearly all existing algorithms, including ACC/PACC quantifiers and maximum likelihood based quantifiers such as EMQ and MLLS. Empirical experiments reveal that SELSE is competitive with, and in many cases outperforms, existing state-of-the-art quantification methods, and that this improvement is especially large when the number of test samples is far greater than the number of train samples.","created":"2022-11-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04274v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Over the years, high cadence microlensing surveys have amassed several terabytes of data while scanning primarily the Galactic Bulge and Magellanic Clouds for microlensing events and thus provide a treasure trove of opportunities for scientific data mining. In particular, numerous asteroids have been observed by visual inspection of selected images. This paper presents novel deep learning-based solutions for the recovery and discovery of asteroids in the microlensing data gathered by the MOA project. Asteroid tracklets can be clearly seen by combining all the observations on a given night and these tracklets inform the structure of the dataset. Known asteroids were identified within these composite images and used for creating the labelled datasets required for supervised learning. Several custom CNN models were developed to identify images with asteroid tracklets. Model ensembling was then employed to reduce the variance in the predictions as well as to improve the generalisation error, achieving a recall of 97.67%. Furthermore, the YOLOv4 object detector was trained to localize asteroid tracklets, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 90.97%. These trained networks will be applied to 16 years of MOA archival data to find both known and unknown asteroids that have been observed by the survey over the years.

{"title":"Defending with Errors: Approximate Computing for Robustness of Deep Neural Networks","abstract":"Machine-learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: inputs crafted carefully to force the system output to a wrong label. Since machine-learning is being deployed in safety-critical and security-sensitive domains, such attacks may have catastrophic security and safety consequences. In this paper, we propose for the first time to use hardware-supported approximate computing to improve the robustness of machine-learning classifiers. We show that successful adversarial attacks against the exact classifier have poor transferability to the approximate implementation. Surprisingly, the robustness advantages also apply to white-box attacks where the attacker has unrestricted access to the approximate classifier implementation: in this case, we show that substantially higher levels of adversarial noise are needed to produce adversarial examples. Furthermore, our approximate computing model maintains the same level in terms of classification accuracy, does not require retraining, and reduces resource utilization and energy consumption of the CNN. We conducted extensive experiments on a set of strong adversarial attacks; We empirically show that the proposed implementation increases the robustness of a LeNet-5, Alexnet and VGG-11 CNNs considerably with up to 50% by-product saving in energy consumption due to the simpler nature of the approximate logic.","created":"2022-11-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01182v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Generative Poisoning Using Random Discriminators","abstract":"We introduce ShortcutGen, a new data poisoning attack that generates sample-dependent, error-minimizing perturbations by learning a generator. The key novelty of ShortcutGen is the use of a randomly-initialized discriminator, which provides spurious shortcuts needed for generating poisons. Different from recent, iterative methods, our ShortcutGen can generate perturbations with only one forward pass in a label-free manner, and compared to the only existing generative method, DeepConfuse, our ShortcutGen is faster and simpler to train while remaining competitive. We also demonstrate that integrating a simple augmentation strategy can further boost the robustness of ShortcutGen against early stopping, and combining augmentation and non-augmentation leads to new state-of-the-art results in terms of final validation accuracy, especially in the challenging, transfer scenario. Lastly, we speculate, through uncovering its working mechanism, that learning a more general representation space could allow ShortcutGen to work for unseen data.","created":"2022-11-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01086v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"SpeechBlender: Speech Augmentation Framework for Mispronunciation Data Generation","abstract":"One of the biggest challenges in designing mispronunciation detection models is the unavailability of labeled L2 speech data. To overcome such data scarcity, we introduce SpeechBlender -- a fine-grained data augmentation pipeline for generating mispronunciation errors. The SpeechBlender utilizes varieties of masks to target different regions of a phonetic unit, and use the mixing factors to linearly interpolate raw speech signals while generating erroneous pronunciation instances. The masks facilitate smooth blending of the signals, thus generating more effective samples than the `Cut/Paste' method. We show the effectiveness of our augmentation technique in a phoneme-level pronunciation quality assessment task, leveraging only a good pronunciation dataset. With SpeechBlender augmentation, we observed a 3% and 2% increase in Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) compared to no-augmentation and goodness of pronunciation augmentation scenarios respectively for Speechocean762 testset. Moreover, a 2% rise in PCC is observed when comparing our single-task phoneme-level mispronunciation detection model with a multi-task learning model using multiple-granularity information.","created":"2022-11-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00923v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Unsupervised Anomaly Detection of Paranasal Anomalies in the Maxillary Sinus","abstract":"Deep learning (DL) algorithms can be used to automate paranasal anomaly detection from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, previous works relied on supervised learning techniques to distinguish between normal and abnormal samples. This method limits the type of anomalies that can be classified as the anomalies need to be present in the training data. Further, many data points from normal and anomaly class are needed for the model to achieve satisfactory classification performance. However, experienced clinicians can segregate between normal samples (healthy maxillary sinus) and anomalous samples (anomalous maxillary sinus) after looking at a few normal samples. We mimic the clinicians ability by learning the distribution of healthy maxillary sinuses using a 3D convolutional auto-encoder (cAE) and its variant, a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture and evaluate cAE and VAE for this task. Concretely, we pose the paranasal anomaly detection as an unsupervised anomaly detection problem. Thereby, we are able to reduce the labelling effort of the clinicians as we only use healthy samples during training. Additionally, we can classify any type of anomaly that differs from the training distribution. We train our 3D cAE and VAE to learn a latent representation of healthy maxillary sinus volumes using L1 reconstruction loss. During inference, we use the reconstruction error to classify between normal and anomalous maxillary sinuses. We extract sub-volumes from larger head and neck MRIs and analyse the effect of different fields of view on the detection performance. Finally, we report which anomalies are easiest and hardest to classify using our approach. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of unsupervised detection of paranasal anomalies from MRIs with an AUPRC of 85% and 80% for cAE and VAE, respectively.","created":"2022-11-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01371v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"GLINKX: A Scalable Unified Framework For Homophilous and Heterophilous Graphs","abstract":"In graph learning, there have been two predominant inductive biases regarding graph-inspired architectures: On the one hand, higher-order interactions and message passing work well on homophilous graphs and are leveraged by GCNs and GATs. Such architectures, however, cannot easily scale to large real-world graphs. On the other hand, shallow (or node-level) models using ego features and adjacency embeddings work well in heterophilous graphs. In this work, we propose a novel scalable shallow method -- GLINKX -- that can work both on homophilous and heterophilous graphs. GLINKX leverages (i) novel monophilous label propagations, (ii) ego/node features, (iii) knowledge graph embeddings as positional embeddings, (iv) node-level training, and (v) low-dimensional message passing. Formally, we prove novel error bounds and justify the components of GLINKX.

{"title":"The Importance of Accurate Alignments in End-to-End Speech Synthesis","abstract":"Unit selection synthesis systems required accurate segmentation and labeling of the speech signal owing to the concatenative nature. Hidden Markov model-based speech synthesis accommodates some transcription errors, but it was later shown that accurate transcriptions yield highly intelligible speech with smaller amounts of training data. With the arrival of end-to-end (E2E) systems, it was observed that very good quality speech could be synthesised with large amounts of data. As end-to-end synthesis progressed from Tacotron to FastSpeech2, it has become imminent that features that represent prosody are important for good-quality synthesis. In particular, durations of the sub-word units are important. Variants of FastSpeech use a teacher model or forced alignments to obtain good-quality synthesis. In this paper, we focus on duration prediction, using signal processing cues in tandem with forced alignment to produce accurate phone durations during training.   The current work aims to highlight the importance of accurate alignments for good-quality synthesis. An attempt is made to train the E2E systems with accurately labeled data, and compare the same with approximately labeled data.","created":"2022-10-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17153v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Predicting Multi-Codebook Vector Quantization Indexes for Knowledge Distillation","abstract":"Knowledge distillation(KD) is a common approach to improve model performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR), where a student model is trained to imitate the output behaviour of a teacher model. However, traditional KD methods suffer from teacher label storage issue, especially when the training corpora are large. Although on-the-fly teacher label generation tackles this issue, the training speed is significantly slower as the teacher model has to be evaluated every batch. In this paper, we reformulate the generation of teacher label as a codec problem. We propose a novel Multi-codebook Vector Quantization (MVQ) approach that compresses teacher embeddings to codebook indexes (CI). Based on this, a KD training framework (MVQ-KD) is proposed where a student model predicts the CI generated from the embeddings of a self-supervised pre-trained teacher model. Experiments on the LibriSpeech clean-100 hour show that MVQ-KD framework achieves comparable performance as traditional KD methods (l1, l2), while requiring 256 times less storage. When the full LibriSpeech dataset is used, MVQ-KD framework results in 13.8% and 8.2% relative word error rate reductions (WERRs) for non -streaming transducer on test-clean and test-other and 4.0% and 4.9% for streaming transducer.

{"title":"Reformulating van Rijsbergen's $F_\u03b2$ metric for weighted binary cross-entropy","abstract":"The separation of performance metrics from gradient based loss functions may not always give optimal results and may miss vital aggregate information. This paper investigates incorporating a performance metric alongside differentiable loss functions to inform training outcomes. The goal is to guide model performance and interpretation by assuming statistical distributions on this performance metric for dynamic weighting. The focus is on van Rijsbergens $F_{\\beta}$ metric -- a popular choice for gauging classification performance. Through distributional assumptions on the $F_{\\beta}$, an intermediary link can be established to the standard binary cross-entropy via dynamic penalty weights. First, the $F_{\\beta}$ metric is reformulated to facilitate assuming statistical distributions with accompanying proofs for the cumulative density function. These probabilities are used within a knee curve algorithm to find an optimal $\\beta$ or $\\beta_{opt}$. This $\\beta_{opt}$ is used as a weight or penalty in the proposed weighted binary cross-entropy. Experimentation on publicly available data with imbalanced classes mostly yields better and interpretable results as compared to the baseline. For example, for the IMDB text data with known labeling errors, a 14% boost is shown. This methodology can accelerate training and provide better interpretation.","created":"2022-10-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16458v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Self-supervised learning with no labels has become a more and more promising way to solve it. Compared with contrastive learning, self-distilled approaches use only positive samples in the loss function and thus are more attractive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on self-distilled self-supervised speaker representation learning, especially on critical data augmentation.

{"title":"Speaker recognition with two-step multi-modal deep cleansing","abstract":"Neural network-based speaker recognition has achieved significant improvement in recent years. A robust speaker representation learns meaningful knowledge from both hard and easy samples in the training set to achieve good performance. However, noisy samples (i.e., with wrong labels) in the training set induce confusion and cause the network to learn the incorrect representation. In this paper, we propose a two-step audio-visual deep cleansing framework to eliminate the effect of noisy labels in speaker representation learning. This framework contains a coarse-grained cleansing step to search for the peculiar samples, followed by a fine-grained cleansing step to filter out the noisy labels. Our study starts from an efficient audio-visual speaker recognition system, which achieves a close to perfect equal-error-rate (EER) of 0.01\\%, 0.07\\% and 0.13\\% on the Vox-O, E and H test sets.

However, these systems model sequence labeling as a sequence prediction task causing a divergence from its well-established token-level tagging formulation. We build compositional end-to-end SLU systems that explicitly separate the added complexity of recognizing spoken mentions in SLU from the NLU task of sequence labeling. By relying on intermediate decoders trained for ASR, our end-to-end systems transform the input modality from speech to token-level representations that can be used in the traditional sequence labeling framework. This composition of ASR and NLU formulations in our end-to-end SLU system offers direct compatibility with pre-trained ASR and NLU systems, allows performance monitoring of individual components and enables the use of globally normalized losses like CRF, making them attractive in practical scenarios. Our models outperform both cascaded and direct end-to-end models on a labeling task of named entity recognition across SLU benchmarks.","created":"2022-10-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15734v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Joint Multi-Person Body Detection and Orientation Estimation via One Unified Embedding","abstract":"Human body orientation estimation (HBOE) is widely applied into various applications, including robotics, surveillance, pedestrian analysis and autonomous driving. Although many approaches have been addressing the HBOE problem from specific under-controlled scenes to challenging in-the-wild environments, they assume human instances are already detected and take a well cropped sub-image as the input. This setting is less efficient and prone to errors in real application, such as crowds of people. In the paper, we propose a single-stage end-to-end trainable framework for tackling the HBOE problem with multi-persons. By integrating the prediction of bounding boxes and direction angles in one embedding, our method can jointly estimate the location and orientation of all bodies in one image directly. Our key idea is to integrate the HBOE task into the multi-scale anchor channel predictions of persons for concurrently benefiting from engaged intermediate features. Therefore, our approach can naturally adapt to difficult instances involving low resolution and occlusion as in object detection. We validated the efficiency and effectiveness of our method in the recently presented benchmark MEBOW with extensive experiments. Besides, we completed ambiguous instances ignored by the MEBOW dataset, and provided corresponding weak body-orientation labels to keep the integrity and consistency of it for supporting studies toward multi-persons.

{"title":"Self-Supervised Training of Speaker Encoder with Multi-Modal Diverse Positive Pairs","abstract":"We study a novel neural architecture and its training strategies of speaker encoder for speaker recognition without using any identity labels. The speaker encoder is trained to extract a fixed-size speaker embedding from a spoken utterance of various length. Contrastive learning is a typical self-supervised learning technique. However, the quality of the speaker encoder depends very much on the sampling strategy of positive and negative pairs. It is common that we sample a positive pair of segments from the same utterance. Unfortunately, such poor-man's positive pairs (PPP) lack necessary diversity for the training of a robust encoder. In this work, we propose a multi-modal contrastive learning technique with novel sampling strategies. By cross-referencing between speech and face data, we study a method that finds diverse positive pairs (DPP) for contrastive learning, thus improving the robustness of the speaker encoder. We train the speaker encoder on the VoxCeleb2 dataset without any speaker labels, and achieve an equal error rate (EER) of 2.89\\%, 3.17\\% and 6.27\\% under the proposed progressive clustering strategy, and an EER of 1.44\\%, 1.77\\% and 3.27\\% under the two-stage learning strategy with pseudo labels, on the three test sets of VoxCeleb1. This novel solution outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods by a large margin, at the same time, achieves comparable results with the supervised learning counterpart. We also evaluate our self-supervised learning technique on LRS2 and LRW datasets, where the speaker information is unknown.

Recent work on the impact of PoS tags on graph- and transition-based parsers suggests that they are only useful when tagging accuracy is prohibitively high, or in low-resource scenarios. However, such an analysis is lacking for the emerging sequence labeling parsing paradigm, where it is especially relevant as some models explicitly use PoS tags for encoding and decoding. We undertake a study and uncover some trends. Among them, PoS tags are generally more useful for sequence labeling parsers than for other paradigms, but the impact of their accuracy is highly encoding-dependent, with the PoS-based head-selection encoding being best only when both tagging accuracy and resource availability are high.","created":"2022-10-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15219v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Yet, existing augmentation policies have so far been designed to only utilize labeled data, which limits the data diversity. In this paper, we recognize that pseudo labeling and data augmentation are complementary, thus propose to leverage unlabeled data for data augmentation to enrich the training data. In particular, we design three novel pseudo-label based data augmentation policies (PseudoAugments) to fuse both labeled and pseudo-labeled scenes, including frames (PseudoFrame), objecta (PseudoBBox), and background (PseudoBackground). PseudoAugments outperforms pseudo labeling by mitigating pseudo labeling errors and generating diverse fused training scenes. We demonstrate PseudoAugments generalize across point-based and voxel-based architectures, different model capacity and both KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset. To alleviate the cost of hyperparameter tuning and iterative pseudo labeling, we develop a population-based data augmentation framework for 3D detection, named AutoPseudoAugment. Unlike previous works that perform pseudo-labeling offline, our framework performs PseudoAugments and hyperparameter tuning in one shot to reduce computational cost. Experimental results on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset show our method outperforms state-of-the-art auto data augmentation method (PPBA) and self-training method (pseudo labeling). In particular, AutoPseudoAugment is about 3X and 2X data efficient on vehicle and pedestrian tasks compared to prior arts.

This increases the computational cost to make inferences linearly in the number of labels. In this work, we improve the efficiency of such cross-encoder-based 0shot models by restricting the number of likely labels using another fast base classifier-based conformal predictor (CP) calibrated on samples labeled by the 0shot model. Since a CP generates prediction sets with coverage guarantees, it reduces the number of target labels without excluding the most probable label based on the 0shot model. We experiment with three intent and two topic classification datasets. With a suitable CP for each dataset, we reduce the average inference time for NLI- and NSP-based models by 25.6% and 22.2% respectively, without dropping performance below the predefined error rate of 1%.","created":"2022-10-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12619v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

While there has been much work in evaluating these models for their performance on a variety of tasks and languages, little attention has been paid on how well calibrated these models are with respect to the confidence in their predictions. We first investigate the calibration of MMLMs in the zero-shot setting and observe a clear case of miscalibration in low-resource languages or those which are typologically diverse from English. Next, we empirically show that calibration methods like temperature scaling and label smoothing do reasonably well towards improving calibration in the zero-shot scenario. We also find that few-shot examples in the language can further help reduce the calibration errors, often substantially. Overall, our work contributes towards building more reliable multilingual models by highlighting the issue of their miscalibration, understanding what language and model specific factors influence it, and pointing out the strategies to improve the same.","created":"2022-10-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12265v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"A Non-Asymptotic Moreau Envelope Theory for High-Dimensional Generalized Linear Models","abstract":"We prove a new generalization bound that shows for any class of linear predictors in Gaussian space, the Rademacher complexity of the class and the training error under any continuous loss $\\ell$ can control the test error under all Moreau envelopes of the loss $\\ell$. We use our finite-sample bound to directly recover the \"optimistic rate\" of Zhou et al. (2021) for linear regression with the square loss, which is known to be tight for minimal $\\ell_2$-norm interpolation, but we also handle more general settings where the label is generated by a potentially misspecified multi-index model. The same argument can analyze noisy interpolation of max-margin classifiers through the squared hinge loss, and establishes consistency results in spiked-covariance settings. More generally, when the loss is only assumed to be Lipschitz, our bound effectively improves Talagrand's well-known contraction lemma by a factor of two, and we prove uniform convergence of interpolators (Koehler et al. 2021) for all smooth, non-negative losses. Finally, we show that application of our generalization bound using localized Gaussian width will generally be sharp for empirical risk minimizers, establishing a non-asymptotic Moreau envelope theory for generalization that applies outside of proportional scaling regimes, handles model misspecification, and complements existing asymptotic Moreau envelope theories for M-estimation.","created":"2022-10-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12082v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Cyclical Self-Supervision for Semi-Supervised Ejection Fraction Prediction from Echocardiogram Videos","abstract":"Left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is an important indicator of heart failure. Existing methods for LVEF estimation from video require large amounts of annotated data to achieve high performance, e.g. using 10,030 labeled echocardiogram videos to achieve mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.10. Labeling these videos is time-consuming however and limits potential downstream applications to other heart diseases. This paper presents the first semi-supervised approach for LVEF prediction. Unlike general video prediction tasks, LVEF prediction is specifically related to changes in the left ventricle (LV) in echocardiogram videos. By incorporating knowledge learned from predicting LV segmentations into LVEF regression, we can provide additional context to the model for better predictions. To this end, we propose a novel Cyclical Self-Supervision (CSS) method for learning video-based LV segmentation, which is motivated by the observation that the heartbeat is a cyclical process with temporal repetition. Prediction masks from our segmentation model can then be used as additional input for LVEF regression to provide spatial context for the LV region. We also introduce teacher-student distillation to distill the information from LV segmentation masks into an end-to-end LVEF regression model that only requires video inputs. Results show our method outperforms alternative semi-supervised methods and can achieve MAE of 4.17, which is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised performance, using half the number of labels. Validation on an external dataset also shows improved generalization ability from using our method.

{"title":"Pseudo-Label Noise Suppression Techniques for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation","abstract":"Semi-supervised learning (SSL) can reduce the need for large labelled datasets by incorporating unlabelled data into the training. This is particularly interesting for semantic segmentation, where labelling data is very costly and time-consuming. Current SSL approaches use an initially supervised trained model to generate predictions for unlabelled images, called pseudo-labels, which are subsequently used for training a new model from scratch. Since the predictions usually do not come from an error-free neural network, they are naturally full of errors. However, training with partially incorrect labels often reduce the final model performance. Thus, it is crucial to manage errors/noise of pseudo-labels wisely. In this work, we use three mechanisms to control pseudo-label noise and errors: (1) We construct a solid base framework by mixing images with cow-patterns on unlabelled images to reduce the negative impact of wrong pseudo-labels. Nevertheless, wrong pseudo-labels still have a negative impact on the performance. Therefore, (2) we propose a simple and effective loss weighting scheme for pseudo-labels defined by the feedback of the model trained on these pseudo-labels. This allows us to soft-weight the pseudo-label training examples based on their determined confidence score during training. (3) We also study the common practice to ignore pseudo-labels with low confidence and empirically analyse the influence and effect of pseudo-labels with different confidence ranges on SSL and the contribution of pseudo-label filtering to the achievable performance gains. We show that our method performs superior to state of-the-art alternatives on various datasets. Furthermore, we show that our findings also transfer to other tasks such as human pose estimation.

{"title":"Self-supervised Representations and Node Embedding Graph Neural Networks for Accurate and Multi-scale Analysis of Materials","abstract":"Supervised machine learning algorithms, such as graph neural networks (GNN), have successfully predicted material properties. However, the superior performance of GNN usually relies on end-to-end learning on large material datasets, which may lose the physical insight of multi-scale information about materials. And the process of labeling data consumes many resources and inevitably introduces errors, which constrains the accuracy of prediction. We propose to train the GNN model by self-supervised learning on the node and edge information of the crystal graph. Compared with the popular manually constructed material descriptors, the self-supervised atomic representation can reach better prediction performance on material properties. Furthermore, it may provide physical insights by tuning the range information. Applying the self-supervised atomic representation on the magnetic moment datasets, we show how they extract rules and information from the magnetic materials. To incorporate rich physical information into the GNN model, we develop the node-embedding graph neural networks (NEGNN) framework and show significant improvements in the prediction performance. The self-supervised material representation and the NEGNN framework may investigate in-depth information from materials and can be applied to small datasets with increased prediction accuracy.","created":"2022-10-19","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03563v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Leveraging a New Spanish Corpus for Multilingual and Crosslingual Metaphor Detection","abstract":"The lack of wide coverage datasets annotated with everyday metaphorical expressions for languages other than English is striking. This means that most research on supervised metaphor detection has been published only for that language. In order to address this issue, this work presents the first corpus annotated with naturally occurring metaphors in Spanish large enough to develop systems to perform metaphor detection. The presented dataset, CoMeta, includes texts from various domains, namely, news, political discourse, Wikipedia and reviews. In order to label CoMeta, we apply the MIPVU method, the guidelines most commonly used to systematically annotate metaphor on real data. We use our newly created dataset to provide competitive baselines by fine-tuning several multilingual and monolingual state-of-the-art large language models. Furthermore, by leveraging the existing VUAM English data in addition to CoMeta, we present the, to the best of our knowledge, first cross-lingual experiments on supervised metaphor detection. Finally, we perform a detailed error analysis that explores the seemingly high transfer of everyday metaphor across these two languages and datasets.","created":"2022-10-19","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10358v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Making Split Learning Resilient to Label Leakage by Potential Energy Loss","abstract":"As a practical privacy-preserving learning method, split learning has drawn much attention in academia and industry. However, its security is constantly being questioned since the intermediate results are shared during training and inference. In this paper, we focus on the privacy leakage problem caused by the trained split model, i.e., the attacker can use a few labeled samples to fine-tune the bottom model, and gets quite good performance. To prevent such kind of privacy leakage, we propose the potential energy loss to make the output of the bottom model become a more `complicated' distribution, by pushing outputs of the same class towards the decision boundary. Therefore, the adversary suffers a large generalization error when fine-tuning the bottom model with only a few leaked labeled samples. Experiment results show that our method significantly lowers the attacker's fine-tuning accuracy, making the split model more resilient to label leakage.","created":"2022-10-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09617v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Improving Contrastive Learning on Visually Homogeneous Mars Rover Images","abstract":"Contrastive learning has recently demonstrated superior performance to supervised learning, despite requiring no training labels. We explore how contrastive learning can be applied to hundreds of thousands of unlabeled Mars terrain images, collected from the Mars rovers Curiosity and Perseverance, and from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Such methods are appealing since the vast majority of Mars images are unlabeled as manual annotation is labor intensive and requires extensive domain knowledge. Contrastive learning, however, assumes that any given pair of distinct images contain distinct semantic content. This is an issue for Mars image datasets, as any two pairs of Mars images are far more likely to be semantically similar due to the lack of visual diversity on the planet's surface. Making the assumption that pairs of images will be in visual contrast - when they are in fact not - results in pairs that are falsely considered as negatives, impacting training performance. In this study, we propose two approaches to resolve this: 1) an unsupervised deep clustering step on the Mars datasets, which identifies clusters of images containing similar semantic content and corrects false negative errors during training, and 2) a simple approach which mixes data from different domains to increase visual diversity of the total training dataset. Both cases reduce the rate of false negative pairs, thus minimizing the rate in which the model is incorrectly penalized during contrastive training. These modified approaches remain fully unsupervised end-to-end. To evaluate their performance, we add a single linear layer trained to generate class predictions based on these contrastively-learned features and demonstrate increased performance compared to supervised models; observing an improvement in classification accuracy of 3.06% using only 10% of the labeled data.","created":"2022-10-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09234v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Adaptive Contrastive Learning with Dynamic Correlation for Multi-Phase Organ Segmentation","abstract":"Recent studies have demonstrated the superior performance of introducing ``scan-wise\" contrast labels into contrastive learning for multi-organ segmentation on multi-phase computed tomography (CT). However, such scan-wise labels are limited: (1) a coarse classification, which could not capture the fine-grained ``organ-wise\" contrast variations across all organs; (2) the label (i.e., contrast phase) is typically manually provided, which is error-prone and may introduce manual biases of defining phases. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven contrastive loss function that adapts the similar/dissimilar contrast relationship between samples in each minibatch at organ-level. Specifically, as variable levels of contrast exist between organs, we hypothesis that the contrast differences in the organ-level can bring additional context for defining representations in the latent space. An organ-wise contrast correlation matrix is computed with mean organ intensities under one-hot attention maps. The goal of adapting the organ-driven correlation matrix is to model variable levels of feature separability at different phases. We evaluate our proposed approach on multi-organ segmentation with both non-contrast CT (NCCT) datasets and the MICCAI 2015 BTCV Challenge contrast-enhance CT (CECT) datasets. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our proposed contrastive loss yields a substantial and significant improvement of 1.41% (from 0.923 to 0.936, p-value$<$0.01) and 2.02% (from 0.891 to 0.910, p-value$<$0.01) on mean Dice scores across all organs with respect to NCCT and CECT cohorts. We further assess the trained model performance with the MICCAI 2021 FLARE Challenge CECT datasets and achieve a substantial improvement of mean Dice score from 0.927 to 0.934 (p-value$<$0.01).

In this paper, we introduce Fuzzy Positive Learning (FPL) for accurate SSL semantic segmentation in a plug-and-play fashion, targeting adaptively encouraging fuzzy positive predictions and suppressing highly-probable negatives. Being conceptually simple yet practically effective, FPL can remarkably alleviate interference from wrong pseudo labels and progressively achieve clear pixel-level semantic discrimination. Concretely, our FPL approach consists of two main components, including fuzzy positive assignment (FPA) to provide an adaptive number of labels for each pixel and fuzzy positive regularization (FPR) to restrict the predictions of fuzzy positive categories to be larger than the rest under different perturbations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on Cityscapes and VOC 2012 with consistent performance gain justify the superiority of our approach.","created":"2022-10-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08519v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"RoS-KD: A Robust Stochastic Knowledge Distillation Approach for Noisy Medical Imaging","abstract":"AI-powered Medical Imaging has recently achieved enormous attention due to its ability to provide fast-paced healthcare diagnoses. However, it usually suffers from a lack of high-quality datasets due to high annotation cost, inter-observer variability, human annotator error, and errors in computer-generated labels. Deep learning models trained on noisy labelled datasets are sensitive to the noise type and lead to less generalization on the unseen samples. To address this challenge, we propose a Robust Stochastic Knowledge Distillation (RoS-KD) framework which mimics the notion of learning a topic from multiple sources to ensure deterrence in learning noisy information. More specifically, RoS-KD learns a smooth, well-informed, and robust student manifold by distilling knowledge from multiple teachers trained on overlapping subsets of training data. Our extensive experiments on popular medical imaging classification tasks (cardiopulmonary disease and lesion classification) using real-world datasets, show the performance benefit of RoS-KD, its ability to distill knowledge from many popular large networks (ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, MobileNet-V2) in a comparatively small network, and its robustness to adversarial attacks (PGD, FSGM). More specifically, RoS-KD achieves >2% and >4% improvement on F1-score for lesion classification and cardiopulmonary disease classification tasks, respectively, when the underlying student is ResNet-18 against recent competitive knowledge distillation baseline. Additionally, on cardiopulmonary disease classification task, RoS-KD outperforms most of the SOTA baselines by ~1% gain in AUC score.","created":"2022-10-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08388v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Augmentation-Free Graph Contrastive Learning of Invariant-Discriminative Representations","abstract":"The pretasks are mainly built on mutual information estimation, which requires data augmentation to construct positive samples with similar semantics to learn invariant signals and negative samples with dissimilar semantics in order to empower representation discriminability. However, an appropriate data augmentation configuration depends heavily on lots of empirical trials such as choosing the compositions of data augmentation techniques and the corresponding hyperparameter settings. We propose an augmentation-free graph contrastive learning method, invariant-discriminative graph contrastive learning (iGCL), that does not intrinsically require negative samples. iGCL designs the invariant-discriminative loss (ID loss) to learn invariant and discriminative representations. On the one hand, ID loss learns invariant signals by directly minimizing the mean square error between the target samples and positive samples in the representation space. On the other hand, ID loss ensures that the representations are discriminative by an orthonormal constraint forcing the different dimensions of representations to be independent of each other. This prevents representations from collapsing to a point or subspace. Our theoretical analysis explains the effectiveness of ID loss from the perspectives of the redundancy reduction criterion, canonical correlation analysis, and information bottleneck principle. The experimental results demonstrate that iGCL outperforms all baselines on 5 node classification benchmark datasets. iGCL also shows superior performance for different label ratios and is capable of resisting graph attacks, which indicates that iGCL has excellent generalization and robustness.

{"title":"Bidirectional Semi-supervised Dual-branch CNN for Robust 3D Reconstruction of Stereo Endoscopic Images via Adaptive Cross and Parallel Supervisions","abstract":"Semi-supervised learning via teacher-student network can train a model effectively on a few labeled samples. It enables a student model to distill knowledge from the teacher's predictions of extra unlabeled data. However, such knowledge flow is typically unidirectional, having the performance vulnerable to the quality of teacher model. In this paper, we seek to robust 3D reconstruction of stereo endoscopic images by proposing a novel fashion of bidirectional learning between two learners, each of which can play both roles of teacher and student concurrently. Specifically, we introduce two self-supervisions, i.e., Adaptive Cross Supervision (ACS) and Adaptive Parallel Supervision (APS), to learn a dual-branch convolutional neural network. The two branches predict two different disparity probability distributions for the same position, and output their expectations as disparity values. The learned knowledge flows across branches along two directions: a cross direction (disparity guides distribution in ACS) and a parallel direction (disparity guides disparity in APS). Moreover, each branch also learns confidences to dynamically refine its provided supervisions. In ACS, the predicted disparity is softened into a unimodal distribution, and the lower the confidence, the smoother the distribution. In APS, the incorrect predictions are suppressed by lowering the weights of those with low confidence. With the adaptive bidirectional learning, the two branches enjoy well-tuned supervisions from each other, and eventually converge on a consistent and more accurate disparity estimation. The extensive and comprehensive experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate our superior performance over the fully-supervised and semi-supervised state-of-the-arts with a decrease of averaged disparity error by 13.95% and 3.90% at least, respectively.","created":"2022-10-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08291v3","tag":"data-quality"}}

To deepen our understanding, we further explore two examples -- mean estimation and logistic regression.

However, the scale of training dataset can significantly affect the security performances of the systems, while it is a great challenge to detect malicious nodes due to the absence of labeled data regarding novel attacks.

First, type-2 fuzzy logic is adopted to evaluate the reputation of sensor nodes while alleviating the uncertainty problem. Then, trust vectors are collected to train a GAN-based codec structure, which is used for further malicious node detection. Moreover, to avoid normal nodes being isolated from the network permanently due to error detections, a GAN-based trust redemption model is constructed to enhance the resilience of trust management. Based on the latest detection results, a trust model update method is developed to adapt to the dynamic industrial environment. The proposed trust management mechanism is finally applied to secure clustering for reliable and real-time data transmission, and simulation results show that it achieves a high detection rate up to 96%, as well as a low false positive rate below 8%.","created":"2022-10-14","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07707v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

The state of the art for automated anomaly detection in these systems typically relies on expert knowledge and thresholds. However, data is viewed isolated and complex, multivariate relationships are neglected. In this work, we present an autoencoder based end-to-end workflow for anomaly detection suitable for multivariate time series data in large industrial cooling systems, including explained fault localization and root cause analysis based on expert knowledge. We identify system failures using a threshold on the total reconstruction error (autoencoder reconstruction error including all sensor signals). For fault localization, we compute the individual reconstruction error (autoencoder reconstruction error for each sensor signal) allowing us to identify the signals that contribute most to the total reconstruction error. Expert knowledge is provided via look-up table enabling root-cause analysis and assignment to the affected subsystem. We demonstrated our findings in a cooling system unit including 34 sensors over a 8-months time period using 4-fold cross validation approaches and automatically created labels based on thresholds provided by domain experts. Using 4-fold cross validation, we reached a F1-score of 0.56, whereas the autoencoder results showed a higher consistency score (CS of 0.92) compared to the automatically created labels (CS of 0.62) -- indicating that the anomaly is recognized in a very stable manner.

{"title":"Noise Audits Improve Moral Foundation Classification","abstract":"Morality plays an important role in culture, identity, and emotion. Recent advances in natural language processing have shown that it is possible to classify moral values expressed in text at scale. Morality classification relies on human annotators to label the moral expressions in text, which provides training data to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, these annotations are inherently subjective and some of the instances are hard to classify, resulting in noisy annotations due to error or lack of agreement. The presence of noise in training data harms the classifier's ability to accurately recognize moral foundations from text. We propose two metrics to audit the noise of annotations. The first metric is entropy of instance labels, which is a proxy measure of annotator disagreement about how the instance should be labeled. The second metric is the silhouette coefficient of a label assigned by an annotator to an instance. This metric leverages the idea that instances with the same label should have similar latent representations, and deviations from collective judgments are indicative of errors. Our experiments on three widely used moral foundations datasets show that removing noisy annotations based on the proposed metrics improves classification performance.","created":"2022-10-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07415v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

An experiment with two annotators independently assigning values shows that only 12 of 40 commonly-used attributes are assigned values with >= 95% consistency, and that three (high cheekbones, pointed nose, oval face) have random consistency (50%). These results show that the binary face attributes currently used in this research area could re-focused to be more objective. We identify 5,068 duplicate face appearances in CelebA, the most widely used dataset in this research area, and find that individual attributes have contradicting values on from 10 to 860 of 5,068 duplicates. Manual audit of a subset of CelebA estimates error rates as high as 40% for (no beard=false), even though the labeling consistency experiment indicates that no beard could be assigned with >= 95% consistency. Selecting the mouth slightly open (MSO) attribute for deeper analysis, we estimate the error rate for (MSO=true) at about 20% and for (MSO=false) at about 2%. We create a corrected version of the MSO attribute values, and compare classification models created using the original versus corrected values. The corrected values enable a model that achieves higher accuracy than has been previously reported for MSO. Also, ScoreCAM visualizations show that the model created using the corrected attribute values is in fact more focused on the mouth region of the face. These results show that the error rate in the current CelebA attribute values should be reduced in order to enable learning of better models. The corrected attribute values for CelebA's MSO and the CelebA facial hair attributes will be made available upon publication.","created":"2022-10-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07356v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"A Consistent and Differentiable Lp Canonical Calibration Error Estimator","abstract":"Calibrated probabilistic classifiers are models whose predicted probabilities can directly be interpreted as uncertainty estimates. It has been shown recently that deep neural networks are poorly calibrated and tend to output overconfident predictions. As a remedy, we propose a low-bias, trainable calibration error estimator based on Dirichlet kernel density estimates, which asymptotically converges to the true $L_p$ calibration error. This novel estimator enables us to tackle the strongest notion of multiclass calibration, called canonical (or distribution) calibration, while other common calibration methods are tractable only for top-label and marginal calibration. The computational complexity of our estimator is $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, the convergence rate is $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$, and it is unbiased up to $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-2})$, achieved by a geometric series debiasing scheme. In practice, this means that the estimator can be applied to small subsets of data, enabling efficient estimation and mini-batch updates. The proposed method has a natural choice of kernel, and can be used to generate consistent estimates of other quantities based on conditional expectation, such as the sharpness of a probabilistic classifier. Empirical results validate the correctness of our estimator, and demonstrate its utility in canonical calibration error estimation and calibration error regularized risk minimization.","created":"2022-10-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07810v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

To address the drawback, we aim to introduce an imbalanced learning framework into ZSL. However, we find that imbalanced ZSL has two unique challenges: (1) Its imbalanced predictions are highly correlated with the value of semantic labels rather than the number of samples as typically considered in the traditional imbalanced learning; (2) Different semantics follow quite different error distributions between classes. To mitigate these issues, we first formalize ZSL as an imbalanced regression problem which offers theoretical foundations to interpret how semantic labels lead to imbalanced semantic predictions. We then propose a re-weighted loss termed Re-balanced Mean-Squared Error (ReMSE), which tracks the mean and variance of error distributions, thus ensuring rebalanced learning across classes. As a major contribution, we conduct a series of analyses showing that ReMSE is theoretically well established. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively alleviates the imbalance in semantic prediction and outperforms many state-of-the-art ZSL methods.","created":"2022-10-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07031v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Multilingual Zero Resource Speech Recognition Base on Self-Supervise Pre-Trained Acoustic Models","abstract":"Labeled audio data is insufficient to build satisfying speech recognition systems for most of the languages in the world. There have been some zero-resource methods trying to perform phoneme or word-level speech recognition without labeled audio data of the target language, but the error rate of these methods is usually too high to be applied in real-world scenarios. Recently, the representation ability of self-supervise pre-trained models has been found to be extremely beneficial in zero-resource phoneme recognition. As far as we are concerned, this paper is the first attempt to extend the use of pre-trained models into word-level zero-resource speech recognition. This is done by fine-tuning the pre-trained models on IPA phoneme transcriptions and decoding with a language model trained on extra texts. Experiments on Wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT models show that this method can achieve less than 20% word error rate on some languages, and the average error rate on 8 languages is 33.77%.","created":"2022-10-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06936v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"PriMeSRL-Eval: A Practical Quality Metric for Semantic Role Labeling Systems Evaluation","abstract":"Semantic role labeling (SRL) identifies the predicate-argument structure in a sentence. This task is usually accomplished in four steps: predicate identification, predicate sense disambiguation, argument identification, and argument classification. Errors introduced at one step propagate to later steps. Unfortunately, the existing SRL evaluation scripts do not consider the full effect of this error propagation aspect. They either evaluate arguments independent of predicate sense (CoNLL09) or do not evaluate predicate sense at all (CoNLL05), yielding an inaccurate SRL model performance on the argument classification task. In this paper, we address key practical issues with existing evaluation scripts and propose a more strict SRL evaluation metric PriMeSRL. We observe that by employing PriMeSRL, the quality evaluation of all SoTA SRL models drops significantly, and their relative rankings also change. We also show that PriMeSRLsuccessfully penalizes actual failures in SoTA SRL models.","created":"2022-10-12","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06408v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"CLEEGN: A Convolutional Neural Network for Plug-and-Play Automatic EEG Reconstruction","abstract":"Human electroencephalography (EEG) is a brain monitoring modality that senses cortical neuroelectrophysiological activity in high-temporal resolution. One of the greatest challenges posed in applications of EEG is the unstable signal quality susceptible to inevitable artifacts during recordings. To date, most existing techniques for EEG artifact removal and reconstruction are applicable to offline analysis solely, or require individualized training data to facilitate online reconstruction. We have proposed CLEEGN, a novel convolutional neural network for plug-and-play automatic EEG reconstruction. CLEEGN is based on a subject-independent pre-trained model using existing data and can operate on a new user without any further calibration. The performance of CLEEGN was validated using multiple evaluations including waveform observation, reconstruction error assessment, and decoding accuracy on well-studied labeled datasets. The results of simulated online validation suggest that, even without any calibration, CLEEGN can largely preserve inherent brain activity and outperforms leading online/offline artifact removal methods in the decoding accuracy of reconstructed EEG data. In addition, visualization of model parameters and latent features exhibit the model behavior and reveal explainable insights related to existing knowledge of neuroscience. We foresee pervasive applications of CLEEGN in prospective works of online plug-and-play EEG decoding and analysis.","created":"2022-10-12","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05988v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"SEAL : Interactive Tool for Systematic Error Analysis and Labeling","abstract":"With the advent of Transformers, large language models (LLMs) have saturated well-known NLP benchmarks and leaderboards with high aggregate performance. However, many times these models systematically fail on tail data or rare groups not obvious in aggregate evaluation. Identifying such problematic data groups is even more challenging when there are no explicit labels (e.g., ethnicity, gender, etc.) and further compounded for NLP datasets due to the lack of visual features to characterize failure modes (e.g., Asian males, animals indoors, waterbirds on land, etc.). This paper introduces an interactive Systematic Error Analysis and Labeling (\\seal) tool that uses a two-step approach to first identify high error slices of data and then, in the second step, introduce methods to give human-understandable semantics to those underperforming slices. We explore a variety of methods for coming up with coherent semantics for the error groups using language models for semantic labeling and a text-to-image model for generating visual features.

{"title":"C-Mixup: Improving Generalization in Regression","abstract":"Improving the generalization of deep networks is an important open challenge, particularly in domains without plentiful data. The mixup algorithm improves generalization by linearly interpolating a pair of examples and their corresponding labels. These interpolated examples augment the original training set. Mixup has shown promising results in various classification tasks, but systematic analysis of mixup in regression remains underexplored. Using mixup directly on regression labels can result in arbitrarily incorrect labels. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful algorithm, C-Mixup, to improve generalization on regression tasks. In contrast with vanilla mixup, which picks training examples for mixing with uniform probability, C-Mixup adjusts the sampling probability based on the similarity of the labels. Our theoretical analysis confirms that C-Mixup with label similarity obtains a smaller mean square error in supervised regression and meta-regression than vanilla mixup and using feature similarity. Another benefit of C-Mixup is that it can improve out-of-distribution robustness, where the test distribution is different from the training distribution. By selectively interpolating examples with similar labels, it mitigates the effects of domain-associated information and yields domain-invariant representations. We evaluate C-Mixup on eleven datasets, ranging from tabular to video data. Compared to the best prior approach, C-Mixup achieves 6.56%, 4.76%, 5.82% improvements in in-distribution generalization, task generalization, and out-of-distribution robustness, respectively.

{"title":"Label Noise-Robust Learning using a Confidence-Based Sieving Strategy","abstract":"In learning tasks with label noise, boosting model robustness against overfitting is a pivotal challenge because the model eventually memorizes labels including the noisy ones. Identifying the samples with corrupted labels and preventing the model from learning them is a promising approach to address this challenge. Per-sample training loss is a previously studied metric that considers samples with small loss as clean samples on which the model should be trained. In this work, we first demonstrate the ineffectiveness of this small-loss trick. Then, we propose a novel discriminator metric called confidence error and a sieving strategy called CONFES to effectively differentiate between the clean and noisy samples. We experimentally illustrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to recent studies on various settings such as synthetic and real-world label noise. Moreover, we show CONFES can be combined with other approaches such as Co-teaching and DivideMix to further improve the model performance.","created":"2022-10-11","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05330v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Visual Prompt Tuning for Test-time Domain Adaptation","abstract":"Models should be able to adapt to unseen data during test-time to avoid performance drops caused by inevitable distribution shifts in real-world deployment scenarios. In this work, we tackle the practical yet challenging test-time adaptation (TTA) problem, where a model adapts to the target domain without accessing the source data. We propose a simple recipe called \\textit{Data-efficient Prompt Tuning} (DePT) with two key ingredients. First, DePT plugs visual prompts into the vision Transformer and only tunes these source-initialized prompts during adaptation. We find such parameter-efficient finetuning can efficiently adapt the model representation to the target domain without overfitting to the noise in the learning objective. Second, DePT bootstraps the source representation to the target domain by memory bank-based online pseudo-labeling. A hierarchical self-supervised regularization specially designed for prompts is jointly optimized to alleviate error accumulation during self-training. With much fewer tunable parameters, DePT demonstrates not only state-of-the-art performance on major adaptation benchmarks VisDA-C, ImageNet-C, and DomainNet-126, but also superior data efficiency, i.e., adaptation with only 1\\% or 10\\% data without much performance degradation compared to 100\\% data.

By providing a robust ordering, data depth -- statistical function that measures belongingness of any point of the space to a data set -- becomes a particularly useful tool for detection of anomalies. Already known for its theoretical properties, data depth has undergone substantial computational developments in the last decade and particularly recent years, which has made it applicable for contemporary-sized problems of data analysis and machine learning.   In this article, data depth is studied as an efficient anomaly detection tool, assigning abnormality labels to observations with lower depth values, in a multivariate setting.

{"title":"Spectral Regularization Allows Data-frugal Learning over Combinatorial Spaces","abstract":"Data-driven machine learning models are being increasingly employed in several important inference problems in biology, chemistry, and physics which require learning over combinatorial spaces. Recent empirical evidence (see, e.g., [1], [2], [3]) suggests that regularizing the spectral representation of such models improves their generalization power when labeled data is scarce. However, despite these empirical studies, the theoretical underpinning of when and how spectral regularization enables improved generalization is poorly understood. In this paper, we focus on learning pseudo-Boolean functions and demonstrate that regularizing the empirical mean squared error by the L_1 norm of the spectral transform of the learned function reshapes the loss landscape and allows for data-frugal learning, under a restricted secant condition on the learner's empirical error measured against the ground truth function. Under a weaker quadratic growth condition, we show that stationary points which also approximately interpolate the training data points achieve statistically optimal generalization performance. Complementing our theory, we empirically demonstrate that running gradient descent on the regularized loss results in a better generalization performance compared to baseline algorithms in several data-scarce real-world problems.","created":"2022-10-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02604v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Functional Labeled Optimal Partitioning","abstract":"Peak detection is a problem in sequential data analysis that involves differentiating regions with higher counts (peaks) from regions with lower counts (background noise).   It is crucial to correctly predict areas that deviate from the background noise, in both the train and test sets of labels.   Dynamic programming changepoint algorithms have been proposed to solve the peak detection problem by constraining the mean to alternatively increase and then decrease.   The current constrained changepoint algorithms only create predictions on the test set, while completely ignoring the train set.   Changepoint algorithms that are both accurate when fitting the train set, and make predictions on the test set, have been proposed but not in the context of peak detection models.   We propose to resolve these issues by creating a new dynamic programming algorithm, FLOPART, that has zero train label errors, and is able to provide highly accurate predictions on the test set.   We provide an empirical analysis that shows FLOPART has a similar time complexity while being more accurate than the existing algorithms in terms of train and test label errors.","created":"2022-10-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02580v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

More importantly, the face images are collected without explicit consent, raising ethical concerns. To avoid such problems, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset for face recognition, obtained by rendering digital faces using a computer graphics pipeline. We first demonstrate that aggressive data augmentation can significantly reduce the synthetic-to-real domain gap. Having full control over the rendering pipeline, we also study how each attribute (e.g., variation in facial pose, accessories and textures) affects the accuracy. Compared to SynFace, a recent method trained on GAN-generated synthetic faces, we reduce the error rate on LFW by 52.5% (accuracy from 91.93% to 96.17%).

Our analysis is based on a decomposition of the target function in terms of the eigenfunctions of a positive-pair Markov chain, and a surprising equivalence between these eigenfunctions and the output of Kernel PCA.

Large offline labeled datasets do not exist for all but the most common articulated object categories (e.g., humans). Hand labeling these landmarks within a video sequence is a laborious task. Learned landmark detectors can help, but can be error-prone when trained from only a few examples. Multi-camera systems that train fine-grained detectors have shown significant promise in detecting such errors, allowing for self-supervised solutions that only need a small percentage of the video sequence to be hand-labeled. The approach, however, is based on calibrated cameras and rigid geometry, making it expensive, difficult to manage, and impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we address these bottlenecks by combining a non-rigid 3D neural prior with deep flow to obtain high-fidelity landmark estimates from videos with only two or three uncalibrated, handheld cameras. With just a few annotations (representing 1-2% of the frames), we are able to produce 2D results comparable to state-of-the-art fully supervised methods, along with 3D reconstructions that are impossible with other existing approaches.

{"title":"Are All Losses Created Equal: A Neural Collapse Perspective","abstract":"While cross entropy (CE) is the most commonly used loss to train deep neural networks for classification tasks, many alternative losses have been developed to obtain better empirical performance. Among them, which one is the best to use is still a mystery, because there seem to be multiple factors affecting the answer, such as properties of the dataset, the choice of network architecture, and so on. This paper studies the choice of loss function by examining the last-layer features of deep networks, drawing inspiration from a recent line work showing that the global optimal solution of CE and mean-square-error (MSE) losses exhibits a Neural Collapse phenomenon. That is, for sufficiently large networks trained until convergence, (i) all features of the same class collapse to the corresponding class mean and (ii) the means associated with different classes are in a configuration where their pairwise distances are all equal and maximized. We extend such results and show through global solution and landscape analyses that a broad family of loss functions including commonly used label smoothing (LS) and focal loss (FL) exhibits Neural Collapse. Hence, all relevant losses(i.e., CE, LS, FL, MSE) produce equivalent features on training data. Based on the unconstrained feature model assumption, we provide either the global landscape analysis for LS loss or the local landscape analysis for FL loss and show that the (only!) global minimizers are neural collapse solutions, while all other critical points are strict saddles whose Hessian exhibit negative curvature directions either in the global scope for LS loss or in the local scope for FL loss near the optimal solution. The experiments further show that Neural Collapse features obtained from all relevant losses lead to largely identical performance on test data as well, provided that the network is sufficiently large and trained until convergence.","created":"2022-10-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02192v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

While numerous anomaly detection methods have been proposed in the literature, a recent survey concluded that no single method is the most accurate across various datasets. To make matters worse, anomaly labels are scarce and rarely available in practice. The practical problem of selecting the most accurate model for a given dataset without labels has received little attention in the literature. This paper answers this question i.e. Given an unlabeled dataset and a set of candidate anomaly detectors, how can we select the most accurate model? To this end, we identify three classes of surrogate (unsupervised) metrics, namely, prediction error, model centrality, and performance on injected synthetic anomalies, and show that some metrics are highly correlated with standard supervised anomaly detection performance metrics such as the $F_1$ score, but to varying degrees. We formulate metric combination with multiple imperfect surrogate metrics as a robust rank aggregation problem. We then provide theoretical justification behind the proposed approach.

As a main-stream loss function for training deep neural network (DNN) classifiers, the cross entropy loss can easily lead us to find models which demonstrate severe overfitting behavior when no other techniques are used for alleviating it such as data augmentation. In this paper, we prove that the existing cross entropy loss minimization for training DNN classifiers essentially learns the conditional entropy of the underlying data distribution of the dataset, i.e., the information or uncertainty remained in the labels after revealing the input. In this paper, we propose a mutual information learning framework where we train DNN classifiers via learning the mutual information between the label and input. Theoretically, we give the population error probability lower bound in terms of the mutual information. In addition, we derive the mutual information lower and upper bounds for a concrete binary classification data model in $\\mbR^n$, and also the error probability lower bound in this scenario. Besides, we establish the sample complexity for accurately learning the mutual information from empirical data samples drawn from the underlying data distribution. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets to support our theory. Without whistles and bells, the proposed mutual information learned classifiers (MILCs) acheive far better generalization performances than the state-of-the-art classifiers with an improvement which can exceed more than 10\\% in testing accuracy.","created":"2022-10-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01000v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Agents employ the recently proposed ACTC (adapt-compress-then-combine) diffusion strategy, where the signals exchanged locally by neighboring agents are encoded with randomized differential compression operators. We provide a detailed characterization of the mean-square estimation error, which is shown to comprise a term related to the error that agents would achieve without communication constraints, plus a term arising from compression. The analysis reveals quantitative relationships between the compression loss and fundamental attributes of the distributed regression problem, in particular, the stochastic approximation error caused by the gradient noise and the network topology (through the Perron eigenvector). We show that knowledge of such relationships is critical to allocate optimally the communication resources across the agents, taking into account their individual attributes, such as the quality of their data or their degree of centrality in the network topology. We devise an optimized allocation strategy where the parameters necessary for the optimization can be learned online by the agents. Illustrative examples show that a significant performance improvement, as compared to a blind (i.e., uniform) resource allocation, can be achieved by optimizing the allocation by means of the provided mean-square-error formulas.","created":"2023-04-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03638v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

We propose RoSteALS, a practical steganography technique leveraging frozen pretrained autoencoders to free the payload embedding from learning the distribution of cover images. RoSteALS has a light-weight secret encoder of just 300k parameters, is easy to train, has perfect secret recovery performance and comparable image quality on three benchmarks. Additionally, RoSteALS can be adapted for novel cover-less steganography applications in which the cover image can be sampled from noise or conditioned on text prompts via a denoising diffusion process.

{"title":"$\\text{DC}^2$: Dual-Camera Defocus Control by Learning to Refocus","abstract":"Smartphone cameras today are increasingly approaching the versatility and quality of professional cameras through a combination of hardware and software advancements. However, fixed aperture remains a key limitation, preventing users from controlling the depth of field (DoF) of captured images. At the same time, many smartphones now have multiple cameras with different fixed apertures -- specifically, an ultra-wide camera with wider field of view and deeper DoF and a higher resolution primary camera with shallower DoF. In this work, we propose $\\text{DC}^2$, a system for defocus control for synthetically varying camera aperture, focus distance and arbitrary defocus effects by fusing information from such a dual-camera system. Our key insight is to leverage real-world smartphone camera dataset by using image refocus as a proxy task for learning to control defocus. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on real-world data demonstrate our system's efficacy where we outperform state-of-the-art on defocus deblurring, bokeh rendering, and image refocus. Finally, we demonstrate creative post-capture defocus control enabled by our method, including tilt-shift and content-based defocus effects.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03285v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Diffusion Models as Masked Autoencoders","abstract":"There has been a longstanding belief that generation can facilitate a true understanding of visual data. In line with this, we revisit generatively pre-training visual representations in light of recent interest in denoising diffusion models. While directly pre-training with diffusion models does not produce strong representations, we condition diffusion models on masked input and formulate diffusion models as masked autoencoders (DiffMAE). Our approach is capable of (i) serving as a strong initialization for downstream recognition tasks, (ii) conducting high-quality image inpainting, and (iii) being effortlessly extended to video where it produces state-of-the-art classification accuracy. We further perform a comprehensive study on the pros and cons of design choices and build connections between diffusion models and masked autoencoders.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03283v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Expert-Independent Generalization of Well and Seismic Data Using Machine Learning Methods for Complex Reservoirs Predicting During Early-Stage Geological Exploration","abstract":"The aim of this study is to develop and apply an autonomous approach for predicting the probability of hydrocarbon reservoirs spreading in the studied area. Autonomy means that after preparing and inputting geological-geophysical information, the influence of an expert on the algorithms is minimized. The study was made based on the 3D seismic survey data and well information on the early exploration stage of the studied field. As a result, a forecast of the probability of spatial distribution of reservoirs was made for two sets of input data: the base set and the set after reverse-calibration, and three-dimensional cubes of calibrated probabilities of belonging of the studied space to the identified classes were obtained. The approach presented in the paper allows for expert-independent generalization of geological and geophysical data, and to use this generalization for hypothesis testing and creating geological models based on a probabilistic representation of the reservoir. The quality of the probabilistic representation depends on the quality and quantity of the input data. Depending on the input data, the approach can be a useful tool for exploration and prospecting of geological objects, identifying potential resources, optimizing and designing field development.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03048v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"TagGPT: Large Language Models are Zero-shot Multimodal Taggers","abstract":"Tags are pivotal in facilitating the effective distribution of multimedia content in various applications in the contemporary Internet era, such as search engines and recommendation systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks. In this work, we propose TagGPT, a fully automated system capable of tag extraction and multimodal tagging in a completely zero-shot fashion. Our core insight is that, through elaborate prompt engineering, LLMs are able to extract and reason about proper tags given textual clues of multimodal data, e.g., OCR, ASR, title, etc. Specifically, to automatically build a high-quality tag set that reflects user intent and interests for a specific application, TagGPT predicts large-scale candidate tags from a series of raw data via prompting LLMs, filtered with frequency and semantics. Given a new entity that needs tagging for distribution, TagGPT introduces two alternative options for zero-shot tagging, i.e., a generative method with late semantic matching with the tag set, and another selective method with early matching in prompts. It is well noticed that TagGPT provides a system-level solution based on a modular framework equipped with a pre-trained LLM (GPT-3.5 used here) and a sentence embedding model (SimCSE used here), which can be seamlessly replaced with any more advanced one you want. TagGPT is applicable for various modalities of data in modern social media and showcases strong generalization ability to a wide range of applications. We evaluate TagGPT on publicly available datasets, i.e., Kuaishou and Food.com, and demonstrate the effectiveness of TagGPT compared to existing hashtags and off-the-shelf taggers.

{"title":"Spectral Energy Distribution profiles from AGN accretion disc in multi-gap setup","abstract":"Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the broad-band continuum emission from black-hole accretion discs can serve as a tool to measure parameters of the central body and constrain the geometry of the inner accretion flow. We focus on the case of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), with an accretion disc dominating the UV/optical bands. We parameterize the changes in the thermal and power-law components, which can reveal the diminution of the emissivity. To this end we explore the effects of gaps in the accretion disc and the emerging SED that can be caused by the presence of either (i) the inner, optically thin, radiatively inefficient hot flow; (ii) a secondary black hole embedded within the accretion disc; or (iii) a combination of both components. We suggest that the resulting changes in the SED of the underlying continuum can help us to understand some departures from the standard-disc scenario. We estimate that the data required for such a project must be sampled in detail over the far-UV to soft X-ray bands during the interval of about a month corresponding to the characteristic variability timescale of an AGN. Detecting a gap at intermediate radii of a few 100 gravitational radii would require quality photometry with uncertainties up to $\\sim$ 1%. The presence of the central cavity in the standard disc can be recovered in UV photometric data with an accuracy of 5% and better. We show the effect of the intrinsic reddening of the source and demonstrate when it can be disentangled.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03015v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"A Closer Look at Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation","abstract":"Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) is a complex task that involves accurately segmenting the corresponding sounding object based on audio-visual queries. Successful audio-visual learning requires two essential components: 1) an unbiased dataset with high-quality pixel-level multi-class labels, and 2) a model capable of effectively linking audio information with its corresponding visual object. However, these two requirements are only partially addressed by current methods, with training sets containing biased audio-visual data, and models that generalise poorly beyond this biased training set. In this work, we propose a new strategy to build cost-effective and relatively unbiased audio-visual semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our strategy, called Visual Post-production (VPO), explores the observation that it is not necessary to have explicit audio-visual pairs extracted from single video sources to build such benchmarks. We also refine the previously proposed AVSBench to transform it into the audio-visual semantic segmentation benchmark AVSBench-Single+. Furthermore, this paper introduces a new pixel-wise audio-visual contrastive learning method to enable a better generalisation of the model beyond the training set. We verify the validity of the VPO strategy by showing that state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained with datasets built by matching audio and visual data from different sources or with datasets containing audio and visual data from the same video source produce almost the same accuracy. Then, using the proposed VPO benchmarks and AVSBench-Single+, we show that our method produces more accurate audio-visual semantic segmentation than SOTA models. Code and dataset will be available.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02970v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Learning Cautiously in Federated Learning with Noisy and Heterogeneous Clients","abstract":"Federated learning (FL) is a distributed framework for collaboratively training with privacy guarantees. In real-world scenarios, clients may have Non-IID data (local class imbalance) with poor annotation quality (label noise). The co-existence of label noise and class imbalance in FL's small local datasets renders conventional FL methods and noisy-label learning methods both ineffective. To address the challenges, we propose FedCNI without using an additional clean proxy dataset. It includes a noise-resilient local solver and a robust global aggregator. For the local solver, we design a more robust prototypical noise detector to distinguish noisy samples. Further to reduce the negative impact brought by the noisy samples, we devise a curriculum pseudo labeling method and a denoise Mixup training strategy. For the global aggregator, we propose a switching re-weighted aggregation method tailored to different learning periods. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method can substantially outperform state-of-the-art solutions in mix-heterogeneous FL environments.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02892v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"MULLER: Multilayer Laplacian Resizer for Vision","abstract":"Image resizing operation is a fundamental preprocessing module in modern computer vision. Throughout the deep learning revolution, researchers have overlooked the potential of alternative resizing methods beyond the commonly used resizers that are readily available, such as nearest-neighbors, bilinear, and bicubic. The key question of our interest is whether the front-end resizer affects the performance of deep vision models? In this paper, we present an extremely lightweight multilayer Laplacian resizer with only a handful of trainable parameters, dubbed MULLER resizer. MULLER has a bandpass nature in that it learns to boost details in certain frequency subbands that benefit the downstream recognition models. We show that MULLER can be easily plugged into various training pipelines, and it effectively boosts the performance of the underlying vision task with little to no extra cost. Specifically, we select a state-of-the-art vision Transformer, MaxViT, as the baseline, and show that, if trained with MULLER, MaxViT gains up to 0.6% top-1 accuracy, and meanwhile enjoys 36% inference cost saving to achieve similar top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k, as compared to the standard training scheme. Notably, MULLER's performance also scales with model size and training data size such as ImageNet-21k and JFT, and it is widely applicable to multiple vision tasks, including image classification, object detection and segmentation, as well as image quality assessment.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02859v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Vehicle Selection for Asynchronous Federated Learning Enabled Vehicular Edge Computing","abstract":"In the traditional vehicular network, computing tasks generated by the vehicles are usually uploaded to the cloud for processing. However, since task offloading toward the cloud will cause a large delay, vehicular edge computing (VEC) is introduced to avoid such a problem and improve the whole system performance, where a roadside unit (RSU) with certain computing capability is used to process the data of vehicles as an edge entity. Owing to the privacy and security issues, vehicles are reluctant to upload local data directly to the RSU, and thus federated learning (FL) becomes a promising technology for some machine learning tasks in VEC, where vehicles only need to upload the local model hyperparameters instead of transferring their local data to the nearby RSU. Furthermore, as vehicles have different local training time due to various sizes of local data and their different computing capabilities, asynchronous federated learning (AFL) is employed to facilitate the RSU to update the global model immediately after receiving a local model to reduce the aggregation delay. However, in AFL of VEC, different vehicles may have different impact on the global model updating because of their various local training delay, transmission delay and local data sizes. Also, if there are bad nodes among the vehicles, it will affect the global aggregation quality at the RSU. To solve the above problem, we shall propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based vehicle selection scheme to improve the accuracy of the global model in AFL of vehicular network. In the scheme, we present the model including the state, action and reward in the DRL based to the specific problem. Simulation results demonstrate our scheme can effectively remove the bad nodes and improve the aggregation accuracy of the global model.","created":"2023-04-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02832v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Zero-shot Medical Image Translation via Frequency-Guided Diffusion Models","abstract":"Recently, the diffusion model has emerged as a superior generative model that can produce high-quality images with excellent realism. There is a growing interest in applying diffusion models to image translation tasks. However, for medical image translation, the existing diffusion models are deficient in accurately retaining structural information since the structure details of source domain images are lost during the forward diffusion process and cannot be fully recovered through learned reverse diffusion, while the integrity of anatomical structures is extremely important in medical images. Training and conditioning diffusion models using paired source and target images with matching anatomy can help. However, such paired data are very difficult and costly to obtain, and may also reduce the robustness of the developed model to out-of-distribution testing data. We propose a frequency-guided diffusion model (FGDM) that employs frequency-domain filters to guide the diffusion model for structure-preserving image translation. Based on its design, FGDM allows zero-shot learning, as it can be trained solely on the data from the target domain, and used directly for source-to-target domain translation without any exposure to the source-domain data during training. We trained FGDM solely on the head-and-neck CT data, and evaluated it on both head-and-neck and lung cone-beam CT (CBCT)-to-CT translation tasks. FGDM outperformed the state-of-the-art methods (GAN-based, VAE-based, and diffusion-based) in all metrics, showing its significant advantages in zero-shot medical image translation.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02742v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Image Stabilization for Hololens Camera in Remote Collaboration","abstract":"With the advent of new technologies, Augmented Reality (AR) has become an effective tool in remote collaboration. Narrow field-of-view (FoV) and motion blur can offer an unpleasant experience with limited cognition for remote viewers of AR headsets. In this article, we propose a two-stage pipeline to tackle this issue and ensure a stable viewing experience with a larger FoV. The solution involves an offline 3D reconstruction of the indoor environment, followed by enhanced rendering using only the live poses of AR device. We experiment with and evaluate the two different 3D reconstruction methods, RGB-D geometric approach and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), based on their data requirements, reconstruction quality, rendering, and training times. The generated sequences from these methods had smoother transitions and provided a better perspective of the environment. The geometry-based enhanced FoV method had better renderings as it lacked blurry outputs making it better than the other attempted approaches. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) metrics were used to quantitatively show that the rendering quality using the geometry-based enhanced FoV method is better.

{"title":"Human Error Management in Requirements Engineering: Should We Fix the People, the Processes, or the Environment?","abstract":"Context: Software development is human-centric and vulnerable to human error. Human errors are errors in the human thought process. To ensure software quality, practitioners must understand how to manage these human errors. Organizations often change the requirements engineering process to prevent human errors from occurring or to mitigate the harm caused when those errors do occur. While there are studies on human error management in other disciplines, research on the prevention and mitigation of human errors in software engineering, and requirements engineering specifically, are limited. The software engineering studies do not provide strong results about the types of changes that are most effective in requirements engineering. Objective: The goal of this paper is to develop a taxonomy of human error prevention and mitigation strategies based on data from requirements engineering professionals. Method: We performed a qualitative analysis of two practitioner surveys on requirements engineering practices to identify and classify strategies for the prevention and mitigation of human errors. Results: We organized the human error management strategies into a taxonomy based on whether they primarily affect People, Processes, or the Environment. Inside each high-level category, we further organized the strategies into low-level classes. More than 50% of the reported strategies require a change in Process, 23% require a change in Environment, 21% require a change in People, with the remaining 5% too ambiguous to classify. In addition, more than 50\\% of the strategies focus on Management activities. Conclusions: The Human Error Management Taxonomy provides a systematic classification and organization of strategies for prevention and mitigation of human errors in requirements engineering. This systematic organization provides a foundation upon which research can build.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02702v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"High-fidelity Pseudo-labels for Boosting Weakly-Supervised Segmentation","abstract":"The task of image-level weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has gained popularity in recent years, as it reduces the vast data annotation cost for training segmentation models. The typical approach for WSSS involves training an image classification network using global average pooling (GAP) on convolutional feature maps. This enables the estimation of object locations based on class activation maps (CAMs), which identify the importance of image regions. The CAMs are then used to generate pseudo-labels, in the form of segmentation masks, to supervise a segmentation model in the absence of pixel-level ground truth. In case of the SEAM baseline, a previous work proposed to improve CAM learning in two ways: (1) Importance sampling, which is a substitute for GAP, and (2) the feature similarity loss, which utilizes a heuristic that object contours almost exclusively align with color edges in images. In this work, we propose a different probabilistic interpretation of CAMs for these techniques, rendering the likelihood more appropriate than the multinomial posterior. As a result, we propose an add-on method that can boost essentially any previous WSSS method, improving both the region similarity and contour quality of all implemented state-of-the-art baselines. This is demonstrated on a wide variety of baselines on the PASCAL VOC dataset. Experiments on the MS COCO dataset show that performance gains can also be achieved in a large-scale setting.

Fairly straightforward methods for computing gradients make the framework compatible with any optimization software, including black-box ones. The performance of the complete computational framework is tested in applications to 2D inverse problems of cancer detection by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) using data from models generated synthetically and obtained from medical images showing the natural development of cancerous regions of various sizes and shapes.

In this work, we propose AdDA, which implements a closed-loop feedback structure to a generic contrastive learning network. AdDA works by allowing the network to adaptively adjust the augmentation compositions according to the real-time feedback. This online adjustment helps maintain the dynamic optimal composition and enables the network to acquire more generalizable representations with minimal computational overhead.

Accordingly, we propose three instruction types for finetuning ParroT models, including translation instruction, contrastive instruction, and error-guided instruction. Experiments on Flores subsets and WMT22 test sets suggest that translation instruction improves the translation performance of vanilla LLMs significantly while error-guided instruction can lead to a further improvement, which demonstrates the importance of learning from low-quality translations annotated by human.

To alleviate this challenge, we propose to utilize a 3D human motion VQ-VAE to project the motions of the two datasets into a latent space consisting of quantized vectors, which effectively mix the motion tokens from the two datasets with different distributions for training. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal transformer to integrate text instructions into motion generation architecture for generating 3D dance movements without degrading the performance of music-conditioned dance generation. To better evaluate the quality of the generated motion, we introduce two novel metrics, namely Motion Prediction Distance (MPD) and Freezing Score, to measure the coherence and freezing percentage of the generated motion.

{"title":"Semantic Communications for Image Recovery and Classification via Deep Joint Source and Channel Coding","abstract":"With the recent advancements in edge artificial intelligence (AI), future sixth-generation (6G) networks need to support new AI tasks such as classification and clustering apart from data recovery. Motivated by the success of deep learning, the semantic-aware and task-oriented communications with deep joint source and channel coding (JSCC) have emerged as new paradigm shifts in 6G from the conventional data-oriented communications with separate source and channel coding (SSCC). However, most existing works focused on the deep JSCC designs for one task of data recovery or AI task execution independently, which cannot be transferred to other unintended tasks. Differently, this paper investigates the JSCC semantic communications to support multi-task services, by performing the image data recovery and classification task execution simultaneously. First, we propose a new end-to-end deep JSCC framework by unifying the coding rate reduction maximization and the mean square error (MSE) minimization in the loss function. Here, the coding rate reduction maximization facilitates the learning of discriminative features for enabling to perform classification tasks directly in the feature space, and the MSE minimization helps the learning of informative features for high-quality image data recovery. Next, to further improve the robustness against variational wireless channels, we propose a new gated deep JSCC design, in which a gated net is incorporated for adaptively pruning the output features to adjust their dimensions based on channel conditions. Finally, we present extensive numerical experiments to validate the performance of our proposed deep JSCC designs as compared to various benchmark schemes.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02317v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Industrial Anomaly Detection with Domain Shift: A Real-world Dataset and Masked Multi-scale Reconstruction","abstract":"Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is crucial for automating industrial quality inspection. The diversity of the datasets is the foundation for developing comprehensive IAD algorithms. Existing IAD datasets focus on the diversity of data categories, overlooking the diversity of domains within the same data category. In this paper, to bridge this gap, we propose the Aero-engine Blade Anomaly Detection (AeBAD) dataset, consisting of two sub-datasets: the single-blade dataset and the video anomaly detection dataset of blades. Compared to existing datasets, AeBAD has the following two characteristics: 1.) The target samples are not aligned and at different scales. 2.) There is a domain shift between the distribution of normal samples in the test set and the training set, where the domain shifts are mainly caused by the changes in illumination and view. Based on this dataset, we observe that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) IAD methods exhibit limitations when the domain of normal samples in the test set undergoes a shift. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called masked multi-scale reconstruction (MMR), which enhances the model's capacity to deduce causality among patches in normal samples by a masked reconstruction task.

The produced dataset is formatted and normalized, enabling its direct utilization as input in subsequent data analysis. This feature will enable materials scientists to develop their own models by selecting high-quality review papers within their domain. Furthermore, we designed experiments to predict solar cells' electrical performance and reverse-predict parameters on both material gene and FAIR datesets through LLM.

{"title":"MoocRadar: A Fine-grained and Multi-aspect Knowledge Repository for Improving Cognitive Student Modeling in MOOCs","abstract":"Student modeling, the task of inferring a student's learning characteristics through their interactions with coursework, is a fundamental issue in intelligent education. Although the recent attempts from knowledge tracing and cognitive diagnosis propose several promising directions for improving the usability and effectiveness of current models, the existing public datasets are still insufficient to meet the need for these potential solutions due to their ignorance of complete exercising contexts, fine-grained concepts, and cognitive labels. In this paper, we present MoocRadar, a fine-grained, multi-aspect knowledge repository consisting of 2,513 exercise questions, 5,600 knowledge concepts, and over 12 million behavioral records. Specifically, we propose a framework to guarantee a high-quality and comprehensive annotation of fine-grained concepts and cognitive labels. The statistical and experimental results indicate that our dataset provides the basis for the future improvements of existing methods. Moreover, to support the convenient usage for researchers, we release a set of tools for data querying, model adaption, and even the extension of our repository, which are now available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/MOOC-Radar.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02205v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Towards Self-Explainability of Deep Neural Networks with Heatmap Captioning and Large-Language Models","abstract":"Heatmaps are widely used to interpret deep neural networks, particularly for computer vision tasks, and the heatmap-based explainable AI (XAI) techniques are a well-researched topic. However, most studies concentrate on enhancing the quality of the generated heatmap or discovering alternate heatmap generation techniques, and little effort has been devoted to making heatmap-based XAI automatic, interactive, scalable, and accessible. To address this gap, we propose a framework that includes two modules: (1) context modelling and (2) reasoning. We proposed a template-based image captioning approach for context modelling to create text-based contextual information from the heatmap and input data. The reasoning module leverages a large language model to provide explanations in combination with specialised knowledge. Our qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and heatmap captioning approach. The code for the proposed template-based heatmap captioning approach will be publicly available.","created":"2023-04-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02202v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Synthesize Extremely High-dimensional Longitudinal Electronic Health Records via Hierarchical Autoregressive Language Model","abstract":"Synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) that are both realistic and preserve privacy can serve as an alternative to real EHRs for machine learning (ML) modeling and statistical analysis. However, generating high-fidelity and granular electronic health record (EHR) data in its original, highly-dimensional form poses challenges for existing methods due to the complexities inherent in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Autoregressive Language mOdel (HALO) for generating longitudinal high-dimensional EHR, which preserve the statistical properties of real EHR and can be used to train accurate ML models without privacy concerns. Our HALO method, designed as a hierarchical autoregressive model, generates a probability density function of medical codes, clinical visits, and patient records, allowing for the generation of realistic EHR data in its original, unaggregated form without the need for variable selection or aggregation. Additionally, our model also produces high-quality continuous variables in a longitudinal and probabilistic manner. We conducted extensive experiments and demonstrate that HALO can generate high-fidelity EHR data with high-dimensional disease code probabilities (d > 10,000), disease co-occurrence probabilities within visits (d > 1,000,000), and conditional probabilities across consecutive visits (d > 5,000,000) and achieve above 0.9 R2 correlation in comparison to real EHR data. This performance then enables downstream ML models trained on its synthetic data to achieve comparable accuracy to models trained on real data (0.938 AUROC with HALO data vs. 0.943 with real data). Finally, using a combination of real and synthetic data enhances the accuracy of ML models beyond that achieved by using only real EHR data.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02169v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"GINA-3D: Learning to Generate Implicit Neural Assets in the Wild","abstract":"Modeling the 3D world from sensor data for simulation is a scalable way of developing testing and validation environments for robotic learning problems such as autonomous driving. However, manually creating or re-creating real-world-like environments is difficult, expensive, and not scalable. Recent generative model techniques have shown promising progress to address such challenges by learning 3D assets using only plentiful 2D images -- but still suffer limitations as they leverage either human-curated image datasets or renderings from manually-created synthetic 3D environments. In this paper, we introduce GINA-3D, a generative model that uses real-world driving data from camera and LiDAR sensors to create realistic 3D implicit neural assets of diverse vehicles and pedestrians. Compared to the existing image datasets, the real-world driving setting poses new challenges due to occlusions, lighting-variations and long-tail distributions. GINA-3D tackles these challenges by decoupling representation learning and generative modeling into two stages with a learned tri-plane latent structure, inspired by recent advances in generative modeling of images. To evaluate our approach, we construct a large-scale object-centric dataset containing over 520K images of vehicles and pedestrians from the Waymo Open Dataset, and a new set of 80K images of long-tail instances such as construction equipment, garbage trucks, and cable cars. We compare our model with existing approaches and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in quality and diversity for both generated images and geometries.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02163v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Initialization Approach for Nonlinear State-Space Identification via the Subspace Encoder Approach","abstract":"The SUBNET neural network architecture has been developed to identify nonlinear state-space models from input-output data. To achieve this, it combines the rolled-out nonlinear state-space equations and a state encoder function, both parameterised as neural networks The encoder function is introduced to reconstruct the current state from past input-output data. Hence, it enables the forward simulation of the rolled-out state-space model. While this approach has shown to provide high-accuracy and consistent model estimation, its convergence can be significantly improved by efficient initialization of the training process. This paper focuses on such an initialisation of the subspace encoder approach using the Best Linear Approximation (BLA). Using the BLA provided state-space matrices and its associated reconstructability map, both the state-transition part of the network and the encoder are initialized. The performance of the improved initialisation scheme is evaluated on a Wiener-Hammerstein simulation example and a benchmark dataset. The results show that for a weakly nonlinear system, the proposed initialisation based on the linear reconstructability map results in a faster convergence and a better model quality.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02119v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Statistics of extreme events in coarse-scale climate simulations via machine learning correction operators trained on nudged datasets","abstract":"This work presents a systematic framework for improving the predictions of statistical quantities for turbulent systems, with a focus on correcting climate simulations obtained by coarse-scale models. While high resolution simulations or reanalysis data are available, they cannot be directly used as training datasets to machine learn a correction for the coarse-scale climate model outputs, since chaotic divergence, inherent in the climate dynamics, makes datasets from different resolutions incompatible. To overcome this fundamental limitation we employ coarse-resolution model simulations nudged towards high quality climate realizations, here in the form of ERA5 reanalysis data. The nudging term is sufficiently small to not pollute the coarse-scale dynamics over short time scales, but also sufficiently large to keep the coarse-scale simulations close to the ERA5 trajectory over larger time scales. The result is a compatible pair of the ERA5 trajectory and the weakly nudged coarse-resolution E3SM output that is used as input training data to machine learn a correction operator. Once training is complete, we perform free-running coarse-scale E3SM simulations without nudging and use those as input to the machine-learned correction operator to obtain high-quality (corrected) outputs. The model is applied to atmospheric climate data with the purpose of predicting global and local statistics of various quantities of a time-period of a decade. Using datasets that are not employed for training, we demonstrate that the produced datasets from the ML-corrected coarse E3SM model have statistical properties that closely resemble the observations. Furthermore, the corrected coarse-scale E3SM output for the frequency of occurrence of extreme events, such as tropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers are presented. We present thorough comparisons and discuss limitations of the approach.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02117v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Scalable and Accurate Self-supervised Multimodal Representation Learning without Aligned Video and Text Data","abstract":"Scaling up weakly-supervised datasets has shown to be highly effective in the image-text domain and has contributed to most of the recent state-of-the-art computer vision and multimodal neural networks. However, existing large-scale video-text datasets and mining techniques suffer from several limitations, such as the scarcity of aligned data, the lack of diversity in the data, and the difficulty of collecting aligned data. Currently popular video-text data mining approach via automatic speech recognition (ASR) used in HowTo100M provides low-quality captions that often do not refer to the video content. Other mining approaches do not provide proper language descriptions (video tags) and are biased toward short clips (alt text). In this work, we show how recent advances in image captioning allow us to pre-train high-quality video models without any parallel video-text data. We pre-train several video captioning models that are based on an OPT language model and a TimeSformer visual backbone. We fine-tune these networks on several video captioning datasets. First, we demonstrate that image captioning pseudolabels work better for pre-training than the existing HowTo100M ASR captions. Second, we show that pre-training on both images and videos produces a significantly better network (+4 CIDER on MSR-VTT) than pre-training on a single modality. Our methods are complementary to the existing pre-training or data mining approaches and can be used in a variety of settings. Given the efficacy of the pseudolabeling method, we are planning to publicly release the generated captions.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02080v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Albatross: A scalable simulation-based inference pipeline for analysing stellar streams in the Milky Way","abstract":"Stellar streams are potentially a very sensitive observational probe of galactic astrophysics, as well as the dark matter population in the Milky Way. On the other hand, performing a detailed, high-fidelity statistical analysis of these objects is challenging for a number of key reasons. Firstly, the modelling of streams across their (potentially billions of years old) dynamical age is complex and computationally costly. Secondly, their detection and classification in large surveys such as Gaia renders a robust statistical description regarding e.g., the stellar membership probabilities, challenging. As a result, the majority of current analyses must resort to simplified models that use only subsets or summaries of the high quality data. In this work, we develop a new analysis framework that takes advantage of advances in simulation-based inference techniques to perform complete analysis on complex stream models. To facilitate this, we develop a new, modular dynamical modelling code sstrax for stellar streams that is highly accelerated using jax. We test our analysis pipeline on a mock observation that resembles the GD1 stream, and demonstrate that we can perform robust inference on all relevant parts of the stream model simultaneously. Finally, we present some outlook as to how this approach can be developed further to perform more complete and accurate statistical analyses of current and future data.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02032v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Model-corrected learned primal-dual models for fast limited-view photoacoustic tomography","abstract":"Learned iterative reconstructions hold great promise to accelerate tomographic imaging with empirical robustness to model perturbations. Nevertheless, an adoption for photoacoustic tomography is hindered by the need to repeatedly evaluate the computational expensive forward model. Computational feasibility can be obtained by the use of fast approximate models, but a need to compensate model errors arises. In this work we advance the methodological and theoretical basis for model corrections in learned image reconstructions by embedding the model correction in a learned primal-dual framework. Here, the model correction is jointly learned in data space coupled with a learned updating operator in image space within an unrolled end-to-end learned iterative reconstruction approach. The proposed formulation allows an extension to a primal-dual deep equilibrium model providing fixed-point convergence as well as reduced memory requirements for training. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the proposed models with numerical validation in a realistic 2D limited-view setting. The model-corrected learned primal-dual methods show excellent reconstruction quality with fast inference times and thus providing a methodological basis for real-time capable and scalable iterative reconstructions in photoacoustic tomography.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01963v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Online Time-Windows TSP with Predictions","abstract":"In the Time-Windows TSP (TW-TSP) we are given requests at different locations on a network; each request is endowed with a reward and an interval of time; the goal is to find a tour that visits as much reward as possible during the corresponding time window. For the online version of this problem, where each request is revealed at the start of its time window, no finite competitive ratio can be obtained. We consider a version of the problem where the algorithm is presented with predictions of where and when the online requests will appear, without any knowledge of the quality of this side information.   Vehicle routing problems such as the TW-TSP can be very sensitive to errors or changes in the input due to the hard time-window constraints, and it is unclear whether imperfect predictions can be used to obtain a finite competitive ratio. We show that good performance can be achieved by explicitly building slack into the solution. Our main result is an online algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio logarithmic in the diameter of the underlying network, matching the performance of the best offline algorithm to within factors that depend on the quality of the provided predictions. The competitive ratio degrades smoothly as a function of the quality and we show that this dependence is tight within constant factors.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01958v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Text-guided domain adaptation methods have allowed the generator to be adapted to the target domains using text prompts, thereby obviating the need for assembling numerous data. Recently, DATID-3D presents impressive quality of samples in text-guided domain, preserving diversity in text by leveraging text-to-image diffusion. However, adapting 3D generators to domains with significant domain gaps from the source domain still remains challenging due to issues in current text-to-image diffusion models as following: 1) shape-pose trade-off in diffusion-based translation, 2) pose bias, and 3) instance bias in the target domain, resulting in inferior 3D shapes, low text-image correspondence, and low intra-domain diversity in the generated samples. To address these issues, we propose a novel pipeline called PODIA-3D, which uses pose-preserved text-to-image diffusion-based domain adaptation for 3D generative models. We construct a pose-preserved text-to-image diffusion model that allows the use of extremely high-level noise for significant domain changes. We also propose specialized-to-general sampling strategies to improve the details of the generated samples. Moreover, to overcome the instance bias, we introduce a text-guided debiasing method that improves intra-domain diversity. Consequently, our method successfully adapts 3D generators across significant domain gaps.

{"title":"A Practical Framework for Unsupervised Structure Preservation Medical Image Enhancement","abstract":"Medical images are extremely valuable for supporting medical diagnoses. However, in practice, low-quality (LQ) medical images, such as images that are hazy/blurry, have uneven illumination, or are out of focus, among others, are often obtained during data acquisition. This leads to difficulties in the screening and diagnosis of medical diseases. Several generative adversarial networks (GAN)-based image enhancement methods have been proposed and have shown promising results. However, there is a quality-originality trade-off among these methods in the sense that they produce visually pleasing results but lose the ability to preserve originality, especially the structural inputs. Moreover, to our knowledge, there is no objective metric in evaluating the structure preservation of medical image enhancement methods in unsupervised settings due to the unavailability of paired ground-truth data. In this study, we propose a framework for practical unsupervised medical image enhancement that includes (1) a non-reference objective evaluation of structure preservation for medical image enhancement tasks called Laplacian structural similarity index measure (LaSSIM), which is based on SSIM and the Laplacian pyramid, and (2) a novel unsupervised GAN-based method called Laplacian medical image enhancement (LaMEGAN) to support the improvement of both originality and quality from LQ images. The LaSSIM metric does not require clean reference images and has been shown to be superior to SSIM in capturing image structural changes under image degradations, such as strong blurring on different datasets. The experiments demonstrated that our LaMEGAN achieves a satisfactory balance between quality and originality, with robust structure preservation performance while generating compelling visual results with very high image quality scores.

A critical issue disturbing the training of an image-to-video model is the ambiguity of the frame ordering since both the forward and backward sequences are plausible solutions. This paper proposes an effective self-supervised ordering scheme that allows training high-quality image-to-video deblurring models. Unlike previous methods that rely on order-invariant losses, we assign an explicit order for each video sequence, thus avoiding the order-ambiguity issue. Specifically, we map each video sequence to a vector in a latent high-dimensional space so that there exists a hyperplane such that for every video sequence, the vectors extracted from it and its reversed sequence are on different sides of the hyperplane. The side of the vectors will be used to define the order of the corresponding sequence.

Unlike simpler video applications, widely used Multi-view Stereo (MVS) based 3D reconstruction applications (e.g., openMVG/openMVS) are exceedingly time consuming, especially when run on such computationally constrained mobile edge devices. Additionally, reducing the reconstruction latency of such inherently sequential algorithms is challenging as unintelligent, application-agnostic strategies can drastically degrade the reconstruction (i.e., application outcome) quality making them useless. In this paper, we aim to design a latency optimized MVS algorithm pipeline, with the objective to best balance the end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality by running the pipeline on a collaborative mobile edge environment. The overall optimization approach is two-pronged where: (a) application optimizations introduce data-level parallelism by splitting the pipeline into high frequency and low frequency reconstruction components and (b) system optimizations incorporate task-level parallelism to the pipelines by running them opportunistically on available resources with online quality control in order to balance both latency and quality. Our evaluation on a hardware testbed using publicly available datasets shows upto ~54% reduction in latency with negligible loss (~4-7%) in reconstruction quality.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01488v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, such 3D annotations are often expensive and time-consuming, which may not be practical for real applications. A natural remedy is to adopt semi-supervised learning (SSL) by leveraging a limited amount of labeled samples and abundant unlabeled samples. Current pseudolabeling-based SSL object detection methods mainly adopt a teacher-student framework, with a single fixed threshold strategy to generate supervision signals, which inevitably brings confused supervision when guiding the student network training. Besides, the data augmentation of the point cloud in the typical teacher-student framework is too weak, and only contains basic down sampling and flip-and-shift (i.e., rotate and scaling), which hinders the effective learning of feature information. Hence, we address these issues by introducing a novel approach of Hierarchical Supervision and Shuffle Data Augmentation (HSSDA), which is a simple yet effective teacher-student framework. The teacher network generates more reasonable supervision for the student network by designing a dynamic dual-threshold strategy. Besides, the shuffle data augmentation strategy is designed to strengthen the feature representation ability of the student network.

{"title":"PEACH: Pre-Training Sequence-to-Sequence Multilingual Models for Translation with Semi-Supervised Pseudo-Parallel Document Generation","abstract":"Multilingual pre-training significantly improves many multilingual NLP tasks, including machine translation. Most existing methods are based on some variants of masked language modeling and text-denoising objectives on monolingual data. Multilingual pre-training on monolingual data ignores the availability of parallel data in many language pairs. Also, some other works integrate the available human-generated parallel translation data in their pre-training. This kind of parallel data is definitely helpful, but it is limited even in high-resource language pairs. This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised method, SPDG, that generates high-quality pseudo-parallel data for multilingual pre-training. First, a denoising model is pre-trained on monolingual data to reorder, add, remove, and substitute words, enhancing the pre-training documents' quality. Then, we generate different pseudo-translations for each pre-training document using dictionaries for word-by-word translation and applying the pre-trained denoising model. The resulting pseudo-parallel data is then used to pre-train our multilingual sequence-to-sequence model, PEACH. Our experiments show that PEACH outperforms existing approaches used in training mT5 and mBART on various translation tasks, including supervised, zero- and few-shot scenarios. Moreover, PEACH's ability to transfer knowledge between similar languages makes it particularly useful for low-resource languages. Our results demonstrate that with high-quality dictionaries for generating accurate pseudo-parallel, PEACH can be valuable for low-resource languages.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01282v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In materials science and other fields, typical ML model results include a significant number of low-quality predictions. This problem is known to be particularly acute for target systems which differ significantly from the data used for ML model training. However, to date, a general method for characterization of the difference between the predicted and training system has not been available. Here, we show that a simple metric based on Euclidean feature space distance and sampling density allows effective separation of the accurately predicted data points from data points with poor prediction accuracy. We show that the metric effectiveness is enhanced by the decorrelation of the features using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. To demonstrate the generality of the method, we apply it to support vector regression models for various small data sets in materials science and other fields. Our method is computationally simple, can be used with any ML learning method and enables analysis of the sources of the ML prediction errors.

The inverse of the internal quality factor is a second measure of the overall loss of the resonator, where TLS loss through the dielectric material is typically the dominant source. The third technique is a differential optical measurement at 150 GHz. The same antenna feeds two microstrip lines with different lengths that terminate in two microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs). The difference in the detector response is used to estimate the loss per unit length of the microstrip line. Our results suggest a larger loss for SiN$_x$ at 150 GHz of ${\\mathrm{\\tan \\delta\\sim 4\\times10^{-3}}}$ compared to ${\\mathrm{2.0\\times10^{-3}}}$ and ${\\mathrm{\\gtrsim 1\\times10^{-3}}}$ measured at $\\sim$1 GHz using the other two methods. {These measurement techniques can be applied to other dielectrics by adjusting the microstrip lengths to provide enough optical efficiency contrast and other mm/sub-mm frequency ranges by tuning the antenna and feedhorn accordingly.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01103v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"ViT-DAE: Transformer-driven Diffusion Autoencoder for Histopathology Image Analysis","abstract":"Generative AI has received substantial attention in recent years due to its ability to synthesize data that closely resembles the original data source. While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have provided innovative approaches for histopathological image analysis, they suffer from limitations such as mode collapse and overfitting in discriminator. Recently, Denoising Diffusion models have demonstrated promising results in computer vision. These models exhibit superior stability during training, better distribution coverage, and produce high-quality diverse images. Additionally, they display a high degree of resilience to noise and perturbations, making them well-suited for use in digital pathology, where images commonly contain artifacts and exhibit significant variations in staining. In this paper, we present a novel approach, namely ViT-DAE, which integrates vision transformers (ViT) and diffusion autoencoders for high-quality histopathology image synthesis. This marks the first time that ViT has been introduced to diffusion autoencoders in computational pathology, allowing the model to better capture the complex and intricate details of histopathology images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ViT-DAE on three publicly available datasets. Our approach outperforms recent GAN-based and vanilla DAE methods in generating realistic images.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01053v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"AMGC: Adaptive match-based genomic compression algorithm","abstract":"Motivation: Despite significant advances in Third-Generation Sequencing (TGS) technologies, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies remain dominant in the current sequencing market. This is due to the lower error rates and richer analytical software of NGS than that of TGS. NGS technologies generate vast amounts of genomic data including short reads, quality values and read identifiers. As a result, efficient compression of such data has become a pressing need, leading to extensive research efforts focused on designing FASTQ compressors. Previous researches show that lossless compression of quality values seems to reach its limits. But there remain lots of room for the compression of the reads part. Results: By investigating the characters of the sequencing process, we present a new algorithm for compressing reads in FASTQ files, which can be integrated into various genomic compression tools. We first reviewed the pipeline of reference-based algorithms and identified three key components that heavily impact storage: the matching positions of reads on the reference sequence(refpos), the mismatched positions of bases on reads(mispos) and the matching failed reads(unmapseq). To reduce their sizes, we conducted a detailed analysis of the distribution of matching positions and sequencing errors and then developed the three modules of AMGC. According to the experiment results, AMGC outperformed the current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81.23% gain in compression ratio on average compared with the second-best-performing compressor.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01031v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Efficient human-in-loop deep learning model training with iterative refinement and statistical result validation","abstract":"Annotation and labeling of images are some of the biggest challenges in applying deep learning to medical data. Current processes are time and cost-intensive and, therefore, a limiting factor for the wide adoption of the technology. Additionally validating that measured performance improvements are significant is important to select the best model. In this paper, we demonstrate a method for creating segmentations, a necessary part of a data cleaning for ultrasound imaging machine learning pipelines. We propose a four-step method to leverage automatically generated training data and fast human visual checks to improve model accuracy while keeping the time/effort and cost low. We also showcase running experiments multiple times to allow the usage of statistical analysis. Poor quality automated ground truth data and quick visual inspections efficiently train an initial base model, which is refined using a small set of more expensive human-generated ground truth data. The method is demonstrated on a cardiac ultrasound segmentation task, removing background data, including static PHI. Significance is shown by running the experiments multiple times and using the student's t-test on the performance distributions. The initial segmentation accuracy of a simple thresholding algorithm of 92% was improved to 98%. The performance of models trained on complicated algorithms can be matched or beaten by pre-training with the poorer performing algorithms and a small quantity of high-quality data. The introduction of statistic significance analysis for deep learning models helps to validate the performance improvements measured. The method offers a cost-effective and fast approach to achieving high-accuracy models while minimizing the cost and effort of acquiring high-quality training data.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00990v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Autonomous Power Line Inspection with Drones via Perception-Aware MPC","abstract":"Drones have the potential to revolutionize power line inspection by increasing productivity, reducing inspection time, improving data quality, and eliminating the risks for human operators. Current state-of-the-art systems for power line inspection have two shortcomings: (i) control is decoupled from perception and needs accurate information about the location of the power lines and masts; (ii) collision avoidance is decoupled from the power line tracking, which results in poor tracking in the vicinity of the power masts, and, consequently, in decreased data quality for visual inspection. In this work, we propose a model predictive controller (MPC) that overcomes these limitations by tightly coupling perception and action. Our controller generates commands that maximize the visibility of the power lines while, at the same time, safely avoiding the power masts. For power line detection, we propose a lightweight learning-based detector that is trained only on synthetic data and is able to transfer zero-shot to real-world power line images. We validate our system in simulation and real-world experiments on a mock-up power line infrastructure.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00959v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Knowledge Accumulation in Continually Learned Representations and the Issue of Feature Forgetting","abstract":"By default, neural networks learn on all training data at once. When such a model is trained on sequential chunks of new data, it tends to catastrophically forget how to handle old data. In this work we investigate how continual learners learn and forget representations. We observe two phenomena: knowledge accumulation, i.e. the improvement of a representation over time, and feature forgetting, i.e. the loss of task-specific representations. To better understand both phenomena, we introduce a new analysis technique called task exclusion comparison. If a model has seen a task and it has not forgotten all the task-specific features, then its representation for that task should be better than that of a model that was trained on similar tasks, but not that exact one. Our image classification experiments show that most task-specific features are quickly forgotten, in contrast to what has been suggested in the past. Further, we demonstrate how some continual learning methods, like replay, and ideas from representation learning affect a continually learned representation. We conclude by observing that representation quality is tightly correlated with continual learning performance.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00933v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

We propose a novel sampling-based iterative algorithm, the iterated diffusion bridge mixture transport (IDBM), aimed at solving the dynamic Schr\\\"odinger bridge problem. The IDBM procedure exhibits the attractive property of realizing a valid coupling between the target measures at each step. We perform an initial theoretical investigation of the IDBM procedure, establishing its convergence properties. The theoretical findings are complemented by numerous numerical experiments illustrating the competitive performance of the IDBM procedure across various applications.   Recent advancements in generative modeling employ the time-reversal of a diffusion process to define a generative process that approximately transports a simple distribution to the data distribution. As an alternative, we propose using the first iteration of the IDBM procedure as an approximation-free method for realizing this transport. This approach offers greater flexibility in selecting the generative process dynamics and exhibits faster training and superior sample quality over longer discretization intervals. In terms of implementation, the necessary modifications are minimally intrusive, being limited to the training loss computation, with no changes necessary for generative sampling.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00917v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Adoption of Artificial Intelligence in Schools: Unveiling Factors Influencing Teachers Engagement","abstract":"Albeit existing evidence about the impact of AI-based adaptive learning platforms, their scaled adoption in schools is slow at best. In addition, AI tools adopted in schools may not always be the considered and studied products of the research community. Therefore, there have been increasing concerns about identifying factors influencing adoption, and studying the extent to which these factors can be used to predict teachers engagement with adaptive learning platforms. To address this, we developed a reliable instrument to measure more holistic factors influencing teachers adoption of adaptive learning platforms in schools. In addition, we present the results of its implementation with school teachers (n=792) sampled from a large country-level population and use this data to predict teachers real-world engagement with the adaptive learning platform in schools. Our results show that although teachers knowledge, confidence and product quality are all important factors, they are not necessarily the only, may not even be the most important factors influencing the teachers engagement with AI platforms in schools. Not generating any additional workload, in-creasing teacher ownership and trust, generating support mechanisms for help, and assuring that ethical issues are minimised, are also essential for the adoption of AI in schools and may predict teachers engagement with the platform better. We conclude the paper with a discussion on the value of factors identified to increase the real-world adoption and effectiveness of adaptive learning platforms by increasing the dimensions of variability in prediction models and decreasing the implementation variability in practice.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00903v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Population size estimation with capture-recapture in presence of individual misidentification and low recapture","abstract":"While non-invasive sampling is more and more commonly used in capture-recapture (CR) experiments, it carries a higher risk of misidentifications than direct observations. As a consequence, one must screen the data to retain only the reliable data before applying a classical CR model. This procedure is unacceptable when too few data would remain. Models able to deal with misidentifications have been proposed but are barely used. Three objectives are pursued in this paper. First, we present the Latent Multinomial Model of Link et al. (2010) where estimates of the model are obtained from a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC). Second we show the impact of the use of an informative prior over the estimations when the capture rate is low. Finally we extend the model to the multistate paradigm as an example of its flexibility.   We showed that, without prior information, with capture rate at 0.2 or lower, parameters of the model are difficult to estimate i.e. either the MCMC does not converge or the estimates are biased. In that case, we show that adding an informative prior on the identification probability solves the identifiability problem of the model and allow for convergence. It also allows for good quality estimates of population size, although when the capture rate is 0.1 it underestimates it of about 10%. A similar approach on the multistate extension show good quality estimates of the population size and transition probabilities with a capture rate of 0.3 or more.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00885v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

One recent related work is the graphics-based generative method, but it can only render low realism head with high computation cost. In this paper, we propose MetaHead, a unified and full-featured controllable digital head engine, which consists of a controllable head radiance field(MetaHead-F) to super-realistically generate or reconstruct view-consistent 3D controllable digital heads and a generic top-down image generation framework LabelHead to generate digital heads consistent with the given customizable feature labels. Experiments validate that our controllable digital head engine achieves the state-of-the-art generation visual quality and reconstruction accuracy. Moreover, the generated labeled data can assist real training data and significantly surpass the labeled data generated by graphics-based methods in terms of training effect.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00838v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this work, we make the first attempt towards addressing this problem, by proposing a self-supervised pre-training approach that can leverage infinite numbers of data to boost the matting performance. The pre-training task is designed in a similar manner as image matting, where random trimap and alpha matte are generated to achieve an image disentanglement objective. The pre-trained model is then used as an initialisation of the downstream matting task for fine-tuning. Extensive experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach outperforms both the state-of-the-art matting methods and other alternative self-supervised initialisation approaches by a large margin. We also show the robustness of the proposed approach over different backbone architectures.

{"title":"CG-3DSRGAN: A classification guided 3D generative adversarial network for image quality recovery from low-dose PET images","abstract":"Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most sensitive molecular imaging modality routinely applied in our modern healthcare. High radioactivity caused by the injected tracer dose is a major concern in PET imaging and limits its clinical applications. However, reducing the dose leads to inadequate image quality for diagnostic practice. Motivated by the need to produce high quality images with minimum low-dose, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based methods have been developed for high quality PET synthesis from its low-dose counterparts. Previous CNNs-based studies usually directly map low-dose PET into features space without consideration of different dose reduction level. In this study, a novel approach named CG-3DSRGAN (Classification-Guided Generative Adversarial Network with Super Resolution Refinement) is presented. Specifically, a multi-tasking coarse generator, guided by a classification head, allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the noise-level features present in the low-dose data, resulting in improved image synthesis. Moreover, to recover spatial details of standard PET, an auxiliary super resolution network - Contextual-Net - is proposed as a second-stage training to narrow the gap between coarse prediction and standard PET. We compared our method to the state-of-the-art methods on whole-body PET with different dose reduction factors (DRFs).

However, concerns have been raised with respect to the trustworthiness of these models: The standard testing method evaluates the performance of a model on a test set, while low-quality and insufficient test sets can lead to unreliable evaluation results, which can have unforeseeable consequences. Therefore, how to comprehensively evaluate CNNs and, based on the evaluation results, how to enhance their trustworthiness are the key problems to be urgently addressed. Prior work has used mutation tests to evaluate the test sets of CNNs. However, the evaluation scores are black boxes and not explicit enough for what is being tested. In this paper, we propose a white-box diagnostic approach that uses mutation operators and image transformation to calculate the feature and attention distribution of the model and further present a diagnosis score, namely D-Score, to reflect the model's robustness and fitness to a dataset. We also propose a D-Score based data augmentation method to enhance the CNN's performance to translations and rescalings. Comprehensive experiments on two widely used datasets and three commonly adopted CNNs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00697v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

As the amount of video used for image recognition increases, efficient compression methods for such video data are necessary. In general, when the image quality deteriorates due to image encoding, the image recognition accuracy also falls. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a neural-network-based approach to improve image recognition accuracy, especially the object detection accuracy by applying post-processing to the encoded video. Versatile Video Coding (VVC) will be used for the video compression method, since it is the latest video coding method with the best encoding performance. The neural network is trained using the features of YOLO-v7, the latest object detection model. By using VVC as the video coding method and YOLO-v7 as the detection model, high object detection accuracy is achieved even at low bit rates. Experimental results show that the combination of the proposed method and VVC achieves better coding performance than regular VVC in object detection accuracy.","created":"2023-04-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00689v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

One of the primary QoS requirements of such applications is ultra-low end-to-end latency for video applications that necessitates rapid frame transfer between end-devices and edge servers using software-defined networking (SDN). Failing to guarantee such strict requirements leads to quality degradation of video applications and subsequently mission failure. In this paper, we show how a collaborative group of attackers can exploit SDN's control communications to launch Denial of Quality of Service (DQoS) attack that artificially increases end-to-end latency of video frames and yet evades detection. In particular, we show how Deep Neural Network (DNN) model training on all or partial network state information can help predict network packet drop rates with reasonable accuracy. We also show how such predictions can help design an attack model that can inflict just the right amount of added latency to the end-to-end video processing that is enough to cause considerable QoS degradation but not too much to raise suspicion.

Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential in improving low-count PET image quality, but acquiring a large, centralized, and diverse dataset from multiple institutions for training a robust model is difficult due to privacy and security concerns of patient data. Moreover, low-count PET data at different institutions may have different data distribution, thus requiring personalized models. While previous federated learning (FL) algorithms enable multi-institution collaborative training without the need of aggregating local data, addressing the large domain shift in the application of multi-institutional low-count PET denoising remains a challenge and is still highly under-explored. In this work, we propose FedFTN, a personalized federated learning strategy that addresses these challenges. FedFTN uses a local deep feature transformation network (FTN) to modulate the feature outputs of a globally shared denoising network, enabling personalized low-count PET denoising for each institution. During the federated learning process, only the denoising network's weights are communicated and aggregated, while the FTN remains at the local institutions for feature transformation. We evaluated our method using a large-scale dataset of multi-institutional low-count PET imaging data from three medical centers located across three continents, and showed that FedFTN provides high-quality low-count PET images, outperforming previous baseline FL reconstruction methods across all low-count levels at all three institutions.","created":"2023-04-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00570v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Item list continuation is proposed to model the overall trend of a list and predict subsequent items. Recently, Transformer-based models have shown promise in comprehending contextual information and capturing item relationships in a list. However, deploying them in real-time industrial applications is challenging, mainly because the autoregressive generation mechanism used in them is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel fast non-autoregressive sequence generation model, namely FANS, to enhance inference efficiency and quality for item list continuation. First, we use a non-autoregressive generation mechanism to decode next $K$ items simultaneously instead of one by one in existing models. Then, we design a two-stage classifier to replace the vanilla classifier used in current transformer-based models to further reduce the decoding time. Moreover, to improve the quality of non-autoregressive generation, we employ a curriculum learning strategy to optimize training. Experimental results on four real-world item list continuation datasets including Zhihu, Spotify, AotM, and Goodreads show that our FANS model can significantly improve inference efficiency (up to 8.7x) while achieving competitive or better generation quality for item list continuation compared with the state-of-the-art autoregressive models.

Because of its biochemical characteristics, synthetic DNA molecules are considered as potential candidates for a new storage paradigm. Because of this trend, several coding solutions have been proposed over the past years for the storage of digital information into DNA. Despite being a promising solution, DNA storage faces two major obstacles: the large cost of synthesis and the noise introduced during sequencing. Additionally, this noise increases when biochemically defined coding constraints are not respected: avoiding homopolymers and patterns, as well as balancing the GC content. This paper describes a novel entropy coder which can be embedded to any block-based image-coding schema and aims to robustify the decoded results. Our proposed solution introduces variability in the generated quaternary streams, reduces the amount of homopolymers and repeated patterns to reduce the probability of errors occurring.

Modern high-throughput technologies produce newer high-dimensional datasets having multiple views with relatively new data types. Visualization of these datasets require proper methodology that can uncover hidden patterns in the data without affecting the local and global structures within the data. To this end, however, very few such methodology exist, which can realise this task. In this work, we have introduced a novel unsupervised deep neural network model, called NeuroDAVIS, for data visualization. NeuroDAVIS is capable of extracting important features from the data, without assuming any data distribution, and visualize effectively in lower dimension. It has been shown theoritically that neighbourhood relationship of the data in high dimension remains preserved in lower dimension. The performance of NeuroDAVIS has been evaluated on a wide variety of synthetic and real high-dimensional datasets including numeric, textual, image and biological data. NeuroDAVIS has been highly competitive against both t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with respect to visualization quality, and preservation of data size, shape, and both local and global structure. It has outperformed Fast interpolation-based t-SNE (Fit-SNE), a variant of t-SNE, for most of the high-dimensional datasets as well. For the biological datasets, besides t-SNE, UMAP and Fit-SNE, NeuroDAVIS has also performed well compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, like Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding (PHATE) and the siamese neural network-based method, called IVIS. Downstream classification and clustering analyses have also revealed favourable results for NeuroDAVIS-generated embeddings.","created":"2023-04-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01222v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"HaLP: Hallucinating Latent Positives for Skeleton-based Self-Supervised Learning of Actions","abstract":"Supervised learning of skeleton sequence encoders for action recognition has received significant attention in recent times. However, learning such encoders without labels continues to be a challenging problem. While prior works have shown promising results by applying contrastive learning to pose sequences, the quality of the learned representations is often observed to be closely tied to data augmentations that are used to craft the positives. However, augmenting pose sequences is a difficult task as the geometric constraints among the skeleton joints need to be enforced to make the augmentations realistic for that action. In this work, we propose a new contrastive learning approach to train models for skeleton-based action recognition without labels. Our key contribution is a simple module, HaLP - to Hallucinate Latent Positives for contrastive learning. Specifically, HaLP explores the latent space of poses in suitable directions to generate new positives. To this end, we present a novel optimization formulation to solve for the synthetic positives with an explicit control on their hardness. We propose approximations to the objective, making them solvable in closed form with minimal overhead. We show via experiments that using these generated positives within a standard contrastive learning framework leads to consistent improvements across benchmarks such as NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-II on tasks like linear evaluation, transfer learning, and kNN evaluation.

{"title":"Human-Centric Resource Allocation in the Metaverse over Wireless Communications","abstract":"The Metaverse will provide numerous immersive applications for human users, by consolidating technologies like extended reality (XR), video streaming, and cellular networks. Optimizing wireless communications to enable the human-centric Metaverse is important to satisfy the demands of mobile users. In this paper, we formulate the optimization of the system utility-cost ratio (UCR) for the Metaverse over wireless networks. Our human-centric utility measure for virtual reality (VR) applications of the Metaverse represents users' perceptual assessment of the VR video quality as a function of the data rate and the video resolution, and is learnt from real datasets. The variables jointly optimized in our problem include the allocation of both communication and computation resources as well as VR video resolutions. The system cost in our problem comprises the energy consumption and delay, and is non-convex with respect to the optimization variables due to fractions in the mathematical expressions. To solve the non-convex optimization, we develop a novel fractional programming technique, which contributes to optimization theory and has broad applicability beyond our paper. Our proposed algorithm for the system UCR optimization is computationally efficient and finds a stationary point to the constrained optimization. Through extensive simulations, our algorithm is demonstrated to outperform other approaches.","created":"2023-04-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00355v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"BioSequence2Vec: Efficient Embedding Generation For Biological Sequences","abstract":"Representation learning is an important step in the machine learning pipeline. Given the current biological sequencing data volume, learning an explicit representation is prohibitive due to the dimensionality of the resulting feature vectors. Kernel-based methods, e.g., SVM, are a proven efficient and useful alternative for several machine learning (ML) tasks such as sequence classification. Three challenges with kernel methods are (i) the computation time, (ii) the memory usage (storing an $n\\times n$ matrix), and (iii) the usage of kernel matrices limited to kernel-based ML methods (difficult to generalize on non-kernel classifiers). While (i) can be solved using approximate methods, challenge (ii) remains for typical kernel methods. Similarly, although non-kernel-based ML methods can be applied to kernel matrices by extracting principal components (kernel PCA), it may result in information loss, while being computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a general-purpose representation learning approach that embodies kernel methods' qualities while avoiding computation, memory, and generalizability challenges. This involves computing a low-dimensional embedding of each sequence, using random projections of its $k$-mer frequency vectors, significantly reducing the computation needed to compute the dot product and the memory needed to store the resulting representation. Our proposed fast and alignment-free embedding method can be used as input to any distance (e.g., $k$ nearest neighbors) and non-distance (e.g., decision tree) based ML method for classification and clustering tasks. Using different forms of biological sequences as input, we perform a variety of real-world classification tasks, such as SARS-CoV-2 lineage and gene family classification, outperforming several state-of-the-art embedding and kernel methods in predictive performance.","created":"2023-04-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00291v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning","abstract":"Recent text-to-image generation models like DreamBooth have made remarkable progress in generating highly customized images of a target subject, by fine-tuning an ``expert model'' for a given subject from a few examples. However, this process is expensive, since a new expert model must be learned for each subject. In this paper, we present SuTI, a Subject-driven Text-to-Image generator that replaces subject-specific fine tuning with \\emph{in-context} learning. Given a few demonstrations of a new subject, SuTI can instantly generate novel renditions of the subject in different scenes, without any subject-specific optimization. SuTI is powered by {\\em apprenticeship learning}, where a single apprentice model is learned from data generated by massive amount of subject-specific expert models. Specifically, we mine millions of image clusters from the Internet, each centered around a specific visual subject. We adopt these clusters to train massive amount of expert models specialized on different subjects. The apprentice model SuTI then learns to mimic the behavior of these experts through the proposed apprenticeship learning algorithm. SuTI can generate high-quality and customized subject-specific images 20x faster than optimization-based SoTA methods. On the challenging DreamBench and DreamBench-v2, our human evaluation shows that SuTI can significantly outperform existing approaches like InstructPix2Pix, Textual Inversion, Imagic, Prompt2Prompt, Re-Imagen while performing on par with DreamBooth.","created":"2023-04-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00186v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Reconstructing firm-level input-output networks from partial information","abstract":"There is a large consensus on the fundamental role of firm-level supply chain networks in macroeconomics. However, data on supply chains at the fine-grained, firm level are scarce and frequently incomplete. For listed firms, some commercial datasets exist but only contain information about the existence of a trade relationship between two companies, not the value of the monetary transaction. We use a recently developed maximum entropy method to reconstruct the values of the transactions based on information about their existence and aggregate information disclosed by firms in financial statements. We test the method on the administrative dataset of Ecuador and reconstruct a commercial dataset (FactSet). We test the method's performance on the weights, the technical and allocation coefficients (microscale quantities), two measures of firms' systemic importance and GDP volatility. The method reconstructs the distribution of microscale quantities reasonably well but shows diverging results for the measures of firms' systemic importance. Due to the network structure of supply chains and the sampling process of firms and links, quantities relying on the number of customers firms have (out-degrees) are harder to reconstruct. We also reconstruct the input-output table of globally listed firms and merge it with a global input-output table at the sector level (the WIOD). Differences in accounting standards between national accounts and firms' financial statements significantly reduce the quality of the reconstruction.","created":"2023-03-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00081v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"A 1.3% distance to M33 from HST Cepheid photometry","abstract":"We present a low-dispersion period-luminosity relation (PL) based on 154 Cepheids in Messier 33 (M33) with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry from the PHATTER survey. Using high-quality ground-based light curves, we recover Cepheid phases and amplitudes for multi-epoch HST data and we perform template fitting to derive intensity-averaged mean magnitudes. HST observations in the SH0ES near-infrared Wesenheit system significantly reduce the effect of crowding relative to ground-based data, as seen in the final PL scatter of $\\sigma$ = 0.11 mag. We adopt the absolute calibration of the PL based on HST observations in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and a distance derived using late-type detached eclipsing binaries to obtain a distance modulus for M33 of $\\mu$ = 24.622 $\\pm$ 0.030 mag (d = 840 $\\pm$ 11 kpc), a best-to-date precision of 1.3%. We find very good agreement with past Cepheid-based measurements. Several TRGB estimates bracket our result while disagreeing with each other. Finally, we show that the flux contribution from star clusters hosting Cepheids in M33 does not impact the distance measurement and we find only 3.7% of the sample is located in (or nearby) young clusters. M33 offers one of the best sites for the cross-calibration of many primary distance indicators. Thus, a precise independent geometric determination of its distance would provide a valuable new anchor to measure the Hubble constant.","created":"2023-03-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00037v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"SemHint-MD: Learning from Noisy Semantic Labels for Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation","abstract":"Without ground truth supervision, self-supervised depth estimation can be trapped in a local minimum due to the gradient-locality issue of the photometric loss. In this paper, we present a framework to enhance depth by leveraging semantic segmentation to guide the network to jump out of the local minimum. Prior works have proposed to share encoders between these two tasks or explicitly align them based on priors like the consistency between edges in the depth and segmentation maps. Yet, these methods usually require ground truth or high-quality pseudo labels, which may not be easily accessible in real-world applications. In contrast, we investigate self-supervised depth estimation along with a segmentation branch that is supervised with noisy labels provided by models pre-trained with limited data. We extend parameter sharing from the encoder to the decoder and study the influence of different numbers of shared decoder parameters on model performance. Also, we propose to use cross-task information to refine current depth and segmentation predictions to generate pseudo-depth and semantic labels for training. The advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated through extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark and a downstream task for endoscopic tissue deformation tracking.","created":"2023-03-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18219v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

The SFDC scheme provides a flexible and simple representation geared towards either practical efficiency or compression ratios, as required. For a text of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\\sigma$ and a fixed parameter $\\lambda$, the access time of the proposed encoding is proportional to the length of the character's code-word, plus an expected $\\mathcal{O}((F_{\\sigma - \\lambda + 3} - 3)/F_{\\sigma+1})$ overhead, where $F_j$ is the $j$-th number of the Fibonacci sequence.

Experimental results show that the performance of our scheme is, in some respects, comparable with the performance of DACs and Wavelet Tees, which are among of the most efficient schemes. In addition our scheme is configured as a \\emph{computation-friendly compression} scheme, as it counts several features that make it very effective in text processing tasks.

Methods - A search of 5 sources was conducted up to 01/12/2022. The inclusion criteria required that research evaluated AI on histopathology images for diagnostic or prognostic inferences in ovarian cancer, including tubo-ovarian and peritoneal tumours. Reviews and non-English language articles were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed for every included model using PROBAST. Results - A total of 1434 research articles were identified, of which 36 were eligible for inclusion. These studies reported 62 models of interest, including 35 classifiers, 14 survival prediction models, 7 segmentation models, and 6 regression models. Models were developed using 1-1375 slides from 1-664 ovarian cancer patients. A wide array of outcomes were predicted, including overall survival (9/62), histological subtypes (7/62), stain quantity (6/62) and malignancy (5/62). Older studies used traditional machine learning (ML) models with hand-crafted features, while newer studies typically employed deep learning (DL) to automatically learn features and predict the outcome(s) of interest. All models were found to be at high or unclear risk of bias overall. Research was frequently limited by insufficient reporting, small sample sizes, and insufficient validation. Conclusion - Limited research has been conducted and none of the associated models have been demonstrated to be ready for real-world implementation. Recommendations are provided addressing underlying biases and flaws in study design, which should help inform higher-quality reproducible future research.

Here we propose novel imputation methods based on determinantal point processes that enhance popular techniques such as the Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) and MissForest. Their advantages are two-fold: improving the quality of the imputed data demonstrated by increased accuracy of the downstream classification; and providing deterministic and reliable imputations that remove the variance from the classification results. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of our methods by performing extensive imputations on synthetic and real clinical data. We also develop quantum circuits for implementing determinantal point processes, since such quantum algorithms provide a computational advantage with respect to classical ones. We demonstrate competitive results with up to ten qubits for small-scale imputation tasks on a state-of-the-art IBM quantum processor.

One such form is connected to software architectures where debt emerges in the form of structural anti-patterns across architecture elements, namely, architecture smells.

In this paper, we aim at exploring whether there exist manifestations of architectural technical debt beyond decreased code or architectural quality, namely, whether there is a relation between architecture smells (which primarily reflect structural characteristics) and the occurrence of concurrency bugs (which primarily manifest at runtime). We study 125 releases of 5 large data-intensive software systems to reveal that (1) several architecture smells may in fact indicate the presence of concurrency problems likely to manifest at runtime but (2) smells are not correlated with concurrency in general -- rather, for specific concurrency bugs they must be combined with an accompanying articulation of specific project characteristics such as project distribution.

{"title":"A Benchmark Generative Probabilistic Model for Weak Supervised Learning","abstract":"Finding relevant and high-quality datasets to train machine learning models is a major bottleneck for practitioners. Furthermore, to address ambitious real-world use-cases there is usually the requirement that the data come labelled with high-quality annotations that can facilitate the training of a supervised model. Manually labelling data with high-quality labels is generally a time-consuming and challenging task and often this turns out to be the bottleneck in a machine learning project. Weak Supervised Learning (WSL) approaches have been developed to alleviate the annotation burden by offering an automatic way of assigning approximate labels (pseudo-labels) to unlabelled data based on heuristics, distant supervision and knowledge bases. We apply probabilistic generative latent variable models (PLVMs), trained on heuristic labelling representations of the original dataset, as an accurate, fast and cost-effective way to generate pseudo-labels. We show that the PLVMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across four datasets. For example, they achieve 22% points higher F1 score than Snorkel in the class-imbalanced Spouse dataset. PLVMs are plug-and-playable and are a drop-in replacement to existing WSL frameworks (e.g. Snorkel) or they can be used as benchmark models for more complicated algorithms, giving practitioners a compelling accuracy boost.","created":"2023-03-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17841v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Improved Difference Images for Change Detection Classifiers in SAR Imagery Using Deep Learning","abstract":"Satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images can be used as a source of remote sensed imagery regardless of cloud cover and day-night cycle. However, the speckle noise and varying image acquisition conditions pose a challenge for change detection classifiers. This paper proposes a new method of improving SAR image processing to produce higher quality difference images for the classification algorithms. The method is built on a neural network-based mapping transformation function that produces artificial SAR images from a location in the requested acquisition conditions. The inputs for the model are: previous SAR images from the location, imaging angle information from the SAR images, digital elevation model, and weather conditions. The method was tested with data from a location in North-East Finland by using Sentinel-1 SAR images from European Space Agency, weather data from Finnish Meteorological Institute, and a digital elevation model from National Land Survey of Finland. In order to verify the method, changes to the SAR images were simulated, and the performance of the proposed method was measured using experimentation where it gave substantial improvements to performance when compared to a more conventional method of creating difference images.","created":"2023-03-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17835v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Lower and upper bounds for the joint batching, routing and sequencing problem","abstract":"Warehouses are nowadays the scene of complex logistic problems integrating different decision layers. This paper addresses the Joint Order Batching, Picker Routing and Sequencing Problem with Deadlines (JOBPRSP-D) in rectangular warehouses. To tackle the problem an exponential linear programming formulation is proposed. It is solved with a column generation heuristic able to provide valid lower and upper bounds on the optimal value. We start by showing that the JOBPRSP-D is related to the bin packing problem rather than the scheduling problem. We take advantage of this aspect to derive a number of valid inequalities that enhance the resolution of the master problem. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on publicly available data-sets. It is able to optimally solve instances with up to 18 orders in few minutes. It is also able to prove optimality or to provide high-quality lower bounds on larger instances with 100 orders. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper that provides optimality guarantee on large size instances for the JOBPRSP-D, thus the results can be used to assert the quality of heuristics proposed for the same problem.","created":"2023-03-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17834v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"LabelVizier: Interactive Validation and Relabeling for Technical Text Annotations","abstract":"With the rapid accumulation of text data produced by data-driven techniques, the task of extracting \"data annotations\"--concise, high-quality data summaries from unstructured raw text--has become increasingly important. The recent advances in weak supervision and crowd-sourcing techniques provide promising solutions to efficiently create annotations (labels) for large-scale technical text data. However, such annotations may fail in practice because of the change in annotation requirements, application scenarios, and modeling goals, where label validation and relabeling by domain experts are required. To approach this issue, we present LabelVizier, a human-in-the-loop workflow that incorporates domain knowledge and user-specific requirements to reveal actionable insights into annotation flaws, then produce better-quality labels for large-scale multi-label datasets. We implement our workflow as an interactive notebook to facilitate flexible error profiling, in-depth annotation validation for three error types, and efficient annotation relabeling on different data scales. We evaluated the efficiency and generalizability of our workflow with two use cases and four expert reviews. The results indicate that LabelVizier is applicable in various application scenarios and assist domain experts with different knowledge backgrounds to efficiently improve technical text annotation quality.","created":"2023-03-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17820v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, the small size and low contrast changes among thalamic nuclei, yield annotations that are often incomplete, noisy, or ambiguously labelled. To train a robust thalamic nuclei parcellation model with noisy annotations, we propose a label propagation algorithm based on random walker to refine the annotations before model training. A two-step model was trained to generate first the whole thalamus and then the nuclei masks. We conducted experiments on a mild traumatic brain injury~(mTBI) dataset with noisy thalamic nuclei annotations.

{"title":"Learning Garment DensePose for Robust Warping in Virtual Try-On","abstract":"Virtual try-on, i.e making people virtually try new garments, is an active research area in computer vision with great commercial applications. Current virtual try-on methods usually work in a two-stage pipeline. First, the garment image is warped on the person's pose using a flow estimation network. Then in the second stage, the warped garment is fused with the person image to render a new try-on image. Unfortunately, such methods are heavily dependent on the quality of the garment warping which often fails when dealing with hard poses (e.g., a person lifting or crossing arms). In this work, we propose a robust warping method for virtual try-on based on a learned garment DensePose which has a direct correspondence with the person's DensePose. Due to the lack of annotated data, we show how to leverage an off-the-shelf person DensePose model and a pretrained flow model to learn the garment DensePose in a weakly supervised manner. The garment DensePose allows a robust warping to any person's pose without any additional computation. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art equivalent on virtual try-on benchmarks and shows warping robustness on in-the-wild person images with hard poses, making it more suited for real-world virtual try-on applications.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17688v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Scalable High-Quality Hypergraph Partitioning","abstract":"Balanced hypergraph partitioning is an NP-hard problem with many applications, e.g., optimizing communication in distributed data placement problems. The goal is to place all nodes across $k$ different blocks of bounded size, such that hyperedges span as few parts as possible. This problem is well-studied in sequential and distributed settings, but not in shared-memory. We close this gap by devising efficient and scalable shared-memory algorithms for all components employed in the best sequential solvers without compromises with regards to solution quality.   This work presents the scalable and high-quality hypergraph partitioning framework Mt-KaHyPar. Its most important components are parallel improvement algorithms based on the FM algorithm and maximum flows, as well as a parallel clustering algorithm for coarsening - which are used in a multilevel scheme with $\\log(n)$ levels. As additional components, we parallelize the $n$-level partitioning scheme, devise a deterministic version of our algorithm, and present optimizations for plain graphs.   We evaluate our solver on more than 800 graphs and hypergraphs, and compare it with 25 different algorithms from the literature. Our fastest configuration outperforms almost all existing hypergraph partitioners with regards to both solution quality and running time. Our highest-quality configuration achieves the same solution quality as the best sequential partitioner KaHyPar, while being an order of magnitude faster with ten threads. Thus, two of our configurations occupy all fronts of the Pareto curve for hypergraph partitioning. Furthermore, our solvers exhibit good speedups, e.g., 29.6x in the geometric mean on 64 cores (deterministic), 22.3x ($\\log(n)$-level), and 25.9x ($n$-level).","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17679v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Iterative Prompt Learning for Unsupervised Backlit Image Enhancement","abstract":"We propose a novel unsupervised backlit image enhancement method, abbreviated as CLIP-LIT, by exploring the potential of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) for pixel-level image enhancement. We show that the open-world CLIP prior not only aids in distinguishing between backlit and well-lit images, but also in perceiving heterogeneous regions with different luminance, facilitating the optimization of the enhancement network. Unlike high-level and image manipulation tasks, directly applying CLIP to enhancement tasks is non-trivial, owing to the difficulty in finding accurate prompts. To solve this issue, we devise a prompt learning framework that first learns an initial prompt pair by constraining the text-image similarity between the prompt (negative/positive sample) and the corresponding image (backlit image/well-lit image) in the CLIP latent space. Then, we train the enhancement network based on the text-image similarity between the enhanced result and the initial prompt pair. To further improve the accuracy of the initial prompt pair, we iteratively fine-tune the prompt learning framework to reduce the distribution gaps between the backlit images, enhanced results, and well-lit images via rank learning, boosting the enhancement performance. Our method alternates between updating the prompt learning framework and enhancement network until visually pleasing results are achieved. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and generalization ability, without requiring any paired data.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17569v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"DAE-Talker: High Fidelity Speech-Driven Talking Face Generation with Diffusion Autoencoder","abstract":"While recent research has made significant progress in speech-driven talking face generation, the quality of the generated video still lags behind that of real recordings. One reason for this is the use of handcrafted intermediate representations like facial landmarks and 3DMM coefficients, which are designed based on human knowledge and are insufficient to precisely describe facial movements. Additionally, these methods require an external pretrained model for extracting these representations, whose performance sets an upper bound on talking face generation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called DAE-Talker that leverages data-driven latent representations obtained from a diffusion autoencoder (DAE). DAE contains an image encoder that encodes an image into a latent vector and a DDIM image decoder that reconstructs the image from it. We train our DAE on talking face video frames and then extract their latent representations as the training target for a Conformer-based speech2latent model. This allows DAE-Talker to synthesize full video frames and produce natural head movements that align with the content of speech, rather than relying on a predetermined head pose from a template video. We also introduce pose modelling in speech2latent for pose controllability. Additionally, we propose a novel method for generating continuous video frames with the DDIM image decoder trained on individual frames, eliminating the need for modelling the joint distribution of consecutive frames directly. Our experiments show that DAE-Talker outperforms existing popular methods in lip-sync, video fidelity, and pose naturalness. We also conduct ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed techniques and demonstrate the pose controllability of DAE-Talker.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17550v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Whose Opinions Do Language Models Reflect?","abstract":"Language models (LMs) are increasingly being used in open-ended contexts, where the opinions reflected by LMs in response to subjective queries can have a profound impact, both on user satisfaction, as well as shaping the views of society at large. In this work, we put forth a quantitative framework to investigate the opinions reflected by LMs -- by leveraging high-quality public opinion polls and their associated human responses. Using this framework, we create OpinionsQA, a new dataset for evaluating the alignment of LM opinions with those of 60 US demographic groups over topics ranging from abortion to automation. Across topics, we find substantial misalignment between the views reflected by current LMs and those of US demographic groups: on par with the Democrat-Republican divide on climate change. Notably, this misalignment persists even after explicitly steering the LMs towards particular demographic groups. Our analysis not only confirms prior observations about the left-leaning tendencies of some human feedback-tuned LMs, but also surfaces groups whose opinions are poorly reflected by current LMs (e.g., 65+ and widowed individuals).

{"title":"Can I Trust My Simulation Model? Measuring the Quality of Business Process Simulation Models","abstract":"Business Process Simulation (BPS) is an approach to analyze the performance of business processes under different scenarios. For example, BPS allows us to estimate what would be the cycle time of a process if one or more resources became unavailable. The starting point of BPS is a process model annotated with simulation parameters (a BPS model). BPS models may be manually designed, based on information collected from stakeholders and empirical observations, or automatically discovered from execution data. Regardless of its origin, a key question when using a BPS model is how to assess its quality. In this paper, we propose a collection of measures to evaluate the quality of a BPS model w.r.t. its ability to replicate the observed behavior of the process. We advocate an approach whereby different measures tackle different process perspectives. We evaluate the ability of the proposed measures to discern the impact of modifications to a BPS model, and their ability to uncover the relative strengths and weaknesses of two approaches for automated discovery of BPS models. The evaluation shows that the measures not only capture how close a BPS model is to the observed behavior, but they also help us to identify sources of discrepancies.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17463v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Prediction of cancer driver genes and mutations: the potential of integrative computational frameworks","abstract":"The vast amount of sequencing data presently available allow the scientific community to explore a range of genetic variables that may drive and progress cancer. A myriad of predictive tools has been proposed, allowing researchers and clinicians to compare and prioritize driver genes and mutations and their relative pathogenicity. However, there is little consensus on the computational approach or a golden standard for comparison. Hence, benchmarking the different tools depends highly on the input data, indicating that overfitting is still a massive problem. One of the solutions is to limit the scope and usage of specific tool. However, such limitations forces researchers to walk on a tightrope between creating and using high-quality tools for a specific purpose and describing the complex alterations driving cancer. While the knowledge of cancer development increases every day, many bioinformatic pipelines rely on single nucleotide variants or alterations in a vacuum without accounting for cellular compartment, mutational burden, or disease progression. Even within bioinformatics and computational cancer biology, the research fields work in silos, risking overlooking potential synergies or breakthroughs. Here, we provide an overview of databases and datasets for building or testing predictive tools for discovery of cancer drivers. We introduce predictive tools for driver genes, driver mutations, and the impact of these based on structural analysis. Additionally, we suggest and recommend directions in the field to avoid silo-research, moving in the direction of integrative frameworks.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17402v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

We sourced audio clips and their raw descriptions from web sources and a sound event detection dataset. However, the online-harvested raw descriptions are highly noisy and unsuitable for direct use in tasks such as automated audio captioning.

{"title":"Joint Rate Allocation and Power Control for RSMA-Based Communication and Radar Coexistence Systems","abstract":"We consider a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based communication and radar coexistence (CRC) system. The proposed system allows an RSMA-based communication system to share spectrum with multiple radars. Furthermore, RSMA enables flexible and powerful interference management by splitting messages into common parts and private parts to partially decode interference and partially treat interference as noise. The RSMA-based CRC system thus significantly improves spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS) of communication users (CUs). However, the RSMA-based CRC system raises new challenges. Due to the spectrum sharing, the communication network and the radars cause interference to each other, which reduces the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the radars as well as the data rate of the CUs in the communication network. Therefore, a major problem is to maximize the sum rate of the CUs while guaranteeing their QoS requirements of data transmissions and the SINR requirements of multiple radars. To achieve these objectives, we formulate a problem that optimizes i) the common rate allocation to the CUs, transmit power of common messages and transmit power of private messages of the CUs, and ii) transmit power of the radars. The problem is non-convex with multiple decision parameters, which is challenging to be solved. We propose two algorithms. The first sequential quadratic programming (SQP) can quickly return a local optimal solution, and has been known to be the state-of-the-art in nonlinear programming methods. The second is an additive approximation scheme (AAS) which solves the problem globally in a reasonable amount of time, based on the technique of applying exhaustive enumeration to a modified instance. The simulation results show the improvement of the AAS compared with the SQP in terms of sum rate.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17392v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Humans in Humans Out: On GPT Converging Toward Common Sense in both Success and Failure","abstract":"Increase in computational scale and fine-tuning has seen a dramatic improvement in the quality of outputs of large language models (LLMs) like GPT. Given that both GPT-3 and GPT-4 were trained on large quantities of human-generated text, we might ask to what extent their outputs reflect patterns of human thinking, both for correct and incorrect cases. The Erotetic Theory of Reason (ETR) provides a symbolic generative model of both human success and failure in thinking, across propositional, quantified, and probabilistic reasoning, as well as decision-making. We presented GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 with 61 central inference and judgment problems from a recent book-length presentation of ETR, consisting of experimentally verified data-points on human judgment and extrapolated data-points predicted by ETR, with correct inference patterns as well as fallacies and framing effects (the ETR61 benchmark). ETR61 includes classics like Wason's card task, illusory inferences, the decoy effect, and opportunity-cost neglect, among others. GPT-3 showed evidence of ETR-predicted outputs for 59% of these examples, rising to 77% in GPT-3.5 and 75% in GPT-4. Remarkably, the production of human-like fallacious judgments increased from 18% in GPT-3 to 33% in GPT-3.5 and 34% in GPT-4. This suggests that larger and more advanced LLMs may develop a tendency toward more human-like mistakes, as relevant thought patterns are inherent in human-produced training data. According to ETR, the same fundamental patterns are involved both in successful and unsuccessful ordinary reasoning, so that the \"bad\" cases could paradoxically be learned from the \"good\" cases. We further present preliminary evidence that ETR-inspired prompt engineering could reduce instances of these mistakes.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17276v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"TPMCF: Temporal QoS Prediction using Multi-Source Collaborative Features","abstract":"Recently, with the rapid deployment of service APIs, personalized service recommendations have played a paramount role in the growth of the e-commerce industry. Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameters determining the service performance, often used for recommendation, fluctuate over time. Thus, the QoS prediction is essential to identify a suitable service among functionally equivalent services over time. The contemporary temporal QoS prediction methods hardly achieved the desired accuracy due to various limitations, such as the inability to handle data sparsity and outliers and capture higher-order temporal relationships among user-service interactions. Even though some recent recurrent neural-network-based architectures can model temporal relationships among QoS data, prediction accuracy degrades due to the absence of other features (e.g., collaborative features) to comprehend the relationship among the user-service interactions. This paper addresses the above challenges and proposes a scalable strategy for Temporal QoS Prediction using Multi-source Collaborative-Features (TPMCF), achieving high prediction accuracy and faster responsiveness. TPMCF combines the collaborative-features of users/services by exploiting user-service relationship with the spatio-temporal auto-extracted features by employing graph convolution and transformer encoder with multi-head self-attention. We validated our proposed method on WS-DREAM-2 datasets. Extensive experiments showed TPMCF outperformed major state-of-the-art approaches regarding prediction accuracy while ensuring high scalability and reasonably faster responsiveness.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18201v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art in DES modeling as well as its current challenges. We also summarize the various modeling approaches to phase equilibria and properties of DESs with gE-models, EOS and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The current gE-model and EOS-based approaches handle DESs as pseudo-components in order to simplify the parameterizations and calculation strategies. However, for the models to become more transferable and predictive, it would be preferable to model the individual DES constituents instead of using the pseudo-components. This implies that validation with more detailed experimental data that includes the distribution of the DES components is also required. MD simulations, in contrast to gE-models and EOS, are capable of providing information about the liquid structure and can predict dynamic properties although, the latter quantities still show some imprecisions. Therefore, insights into the liquid structure of DES systems from MD could also aid in improving present modeling strategies in addition to a better understanding. Finally, the latest developments for DES force fields are discussed as the quality of the applied force fields determine the results of MD simulations.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17159v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Offline PLfO aims to learn policies using datasets with substandard qualities: 1) only a subset of trajectories is labeled with rewards, 2) labeled trajectories may not contain actions, 3) labeled trajectories may not be of high quality, and 4) the overall data may not have full coverage. Such imperfection is common in real-world learning scenarios, so offline PLfO encompasses many existing offline learning setups, including offline imitation learning (IL), ILfO, and reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we present a generic approach, called Modality-agnostic Adversarial Hypothesis Adaptation for Learning from Observations (MAHALO), for offline PLfO. Built upon the pessimism concept in offline RL, MAHALO optimizes the policy using a performance lower bound that accounts for uncertainty due to the dataset's insufficient converge. We implement this idea by adversarially training data-consistent critic and reward functions in policy optimization, which forces the learned policy to be robust to the data deficiency. We show that MAHALO consistently outperforms or matches specialized algorithms across a variety of offline PLfO tasks in theory and experiments.","created":"2023-03-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17156v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Discriminative Class Tokens for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models","abstract":"Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the generation of diverse and high-quality images. However, generated images often fall short of depicting subtle details and are susceptible to errors due to ambiguity in the input text. One way of alleviating these issues is to train diffusion models on class-labeled datasets. This comes with a downside, doing so limits their expressive power: (i) supervised datasets are generally small compared to large-scale scraped text-image datasets on which text-to-image models are trained, and so the quality and diversity of generated images are severely affected, or (ii) the input is a hard-coded label, as opposed to free-form text, which limits the control over the generated images.   In this work, we propose a non-invasive fine-tuning technique that capitalizes on the expressive potential of free-form text while achieving high accuracy through discriminative signals from a pretrained classifier, which guides the generation. This is done by iteratively modifying the embedding of a single input token of a text-to-image diffusion model, using the classifier, by steering generated images toward a given target class. Our method is fast compared to prior fine-tuning methods and does not require a collection of in-class images or retraining of a noise-tolerant classifier. We evaluate our method extensively, showing that the generated images are: (i) more accurate and of higher quality than standard diffusion models, (ii) can be used to augment training data in a low-resource setting, and (iii) reveal information about the data used to train the guiding classifier.

{"title":"Ideal Abstractions for Decision-Focused Learning","abstract":"We present a methodology for formulating simplifying abstractions in machine learning systems by identifying and harnessing the utility structure of decisions. Machine learning tasks commonly involve high-dimensional output spaces (e.g., predictions for every pixel in an image or node in a graph), even though a coarser output would often suffice for downstream decision-making (e.g., regions of an image instead of pixels). Developers often hand-engineer abstractions of the output space, but numerous abstractions are possible and it is unclear how the choice of output space for a model impacts its usefulness in downstream decision-making. We propose a method that configures the output space automatically in order to minimize the loss of decision-relevant information. Taking a geometric perspective, we formulate a step of the algorithm as a projection of the probability simplex, termed fold, that minimizes the total loss of decision-related information in the H-entropy sense. Crucially, learning in the abstracted outcome space requires less data, leading to a net improvement in decision quality. We demonstrate the method in two domains: data acquisition for deep neural network training and a closed-loop wildfire management task.","created":"2023-03-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17062v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Recently, I2I methods were also employed in histopathology for generating artificial images of in silico stained tissues from a different type of staining. We refer to this process as stain transfer. The number of I2I variants is constantly increasing, which makes a well justified choice of the most suitable I2I methods for stain transfer challenging. In our work, we compare twelve stain transfer approaches, three of which are based on traditional and nine on GAN-based image processing methods. The analysis relies on complementary quantitative measures for the quality of image translation, the assessment of the suitability for deep learning-based tissue grading, and the visual evaluation by pathologists. Our study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the stain transfer approaches, thereby allowing a rational choice of the underlying I2I algorithms.

The quality of a similarity measure is typically evaluated by its success in assigning a high score to representations that are expected to be matched. However, existing similarity measures perform mediocrely on standard benchmarks. In this work, we develop a new similarity measure, dubbed ContraSim, based on contrastive learning. In contrast to common closed-form similarity measures, ContraSim learns a parameterized measure by using both similar and dissimilar examples. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our method, with both language and vision models, on the standard layer prediction benchmark and two new benchmarks that we introduce: the multilingual benchmark and the image-caption benchmark. In all cases, ContraSim achieves much higher accuracy than previous similarity measures, even when presented with challenging examples, and reveals new insights not captured by previous measures.","created":"2023-03-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16992v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Fairness-Aware Data Valuation for Supervised Learning","abstract":"Data valuation is a ML field that studies the value of training instances towards a given predictive task. Although data bias is one of the main sources of downstream model unfairness, previous work in data valuation does not consider how training instances may influence both performance and fairness of ML models. Thus, we propose Fairness-Aware Data vauatiOn (FADO), a data valuation framework that can be used to incorporate fairness concerns into a series of ML-related tasks (e.g., data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, active learning). We propose an entropy-based data valuation metric suited to address our two-pronged goal of maximizing both performance and fairness, which is more computationally efficient than existing metrics. We then show how FADO can be applied as the basis for unfairness mitigation pre-processing techniques. Our methods achieve promising results -- up to a 40 p.p. improvement in fairness at a less than 1 p.p. loss in performance compared to a baseline -- and promote fairness in a data-centric way, where a deeper understanding of data quality takes center stage.","created":"2023-03-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16963v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Generating high-quality movie AD is challenging due to the dependency of the descriptions on context, and the limited amount of training data available. In this work, we leverage the power of pretrained foundation models, such as GPT and CLIP, and only train a mapping network that bridges the two models for visually-conditioned text generation. In order to obtain high-quality AD, we make the following four contributions: (i) we incorporate context from the movie clip, AD from previous clips, as well as the subtitles; (ii) we address the lack of training data by pretraining on large-scale datasets, where visual or contextual information is unavailable, e.g. text-only AD without movies or visual captioning datasets without context; (iii) we improve on the currently available AD datasets, by removing label noise in the MAD dataset, and adding character naming information; and (iv) we obtain strong results on the movie AD task compared with previous methods.","created":"2023-03-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16899v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Highly-Anisotropic Even-Denominator Fractional Quantum Hall State in an Orbitally-Coupled Half-Filled Landau Level","abstract":"The even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) in half-filled Landau levels are generally believed to host non-Abelian quasiparticles and be of potential use in topological quantum computing. Of particular interest is the competition and interplay between the even-denominator FQHSs and other ground states, such as anisotropic phases and composite fermion Fermi seas. Here we report the observation of an even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state with highly-anisotropic in-plane transport coefficients at Landau level filling factor $\\nu=3/2$. We observe this state in an ultra-high-quality GaAs two-dimensional hole system when a large in-plane magnetic field is applied. By increasing the in-plane field, we observe a sharp transition from an isotropic composite fermion Fermi sea to an anisotropic even-denominator FQHS. Our data and calculations suggest that a unique feature of two-dimensional holes, namely the coupling between heavy-hole and light-hole states, combines different orbital components in the wavefunction of one Landau level, and leads to the emergence of a highly-anisotropic even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state. Our results demonstrate that the GaAs two-dimensional hole system is a unique platform for the exploration of exotic, many-body ground states.","created":"2023-03-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16791v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Fair Federated Medical Image Segmentation via Client Contribution Estimation","abstract":"How to ensure fairness is an important topic in federated learning (FL). Recent studies have investigated how to reward clients based on their contribution (collaboration fairness), and how to achieve uniformity of performance across clients (performance fairness). Despite achieving progress on either one, we argue that it is critical to consider them together, in order to engage and motivate more diverse clients joining FL to derive a high-quality global model. In this work, we propose a novel method to optimize both types of fairness simultaneously. Specifically, we propose to estimate client contribution in gradient and data space. In gradient space, we monitor the gradient direction differences of each client with respect to others. And in data space, we measure the prediction error on client data using an auxiliary model. Based on this contribution estimation, we propose a FL method, federated training via contribution estimation (FedCE), i.e., using estimation as global model aggregation weights. We have theoretically analyzed our method and empirically evaluated it on two real-world medical datasets. The effectiveness of our approach has been validated with significant performance improvements, better collaboration fairness, better performance fairness, and comprehensive analytical studies.","created":"2023-03-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16520v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Seeing What You Said: Talking Face Generation Guided by a Lip Reading Expert","abstract":"Talking face generation, also known as speech-to-lip generation, reconstructs facial motions concerning lips given coherent speech input. The previous studies revealed the importance of lip-speech synchronization and visual quality. Despite much progress, they hardly focus on the content of lip movements i.e., the visual intelligibility of the spoken words, which is an important aspect of generation quality. To address the problem, we propose using a lip-reading expert to improve the intelligibility of the generated lip regions by penalizing the incorrect generation results. Moreover, to compensate for data scarcity, we train the lip-reading expert in an audio-visual self-supervised manner. With a lip-reading expert, we propose a novel contrastive learning to enhance lip-speech synchronization, and a transformer to encode audio synchronically with video, while considering global temporal dependency of audio. For evaluation, we propose a new strategy with two different lip-reading experts to measure intelligibility of the generated videos. Rigorous experiments show that our proposal is superior to other State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, such as Wav2Lip, in reading intelligibility i.e., over 38% Word Error Rate (WER) on LRS2 dataset and 27.8% accuracy on LRW dataset.

{"title":"HOLODIFFUSION: Training a 3D Diffusion Model using 2D Images","abstract":"Diffusion models have emerged as the best approach for generative modeling of 2D images. Part of their success is due to the possibility of training them on millions if not billions of images with a stable learning objective. However, extending these models to 3D remains difficult for two reasons. First, finding a large quantity of 3D training data is much more complex than for 2D images. Second, while it is conceptually trivial to extend the models to operate on 3D rather than 2D grids, the associated cubic growth in memory and compute complexity makes this infeasible. We address the first challenge by introducing a new diffusion setup that can be trained, end-to-end, with only posed 2D images for supervision; and the second challenge by proposing an image formation model that decouples model memory from spatial memory. We evaluate our method on real-world data, using the CO3D dataset which has not been used to train 3D generative models before. We show that our diffusion models are scalable, train robustly, and are competitive in terms of sample quality and fidelity to existing approaches for 3D generative modeling.","created":"2023-03-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16509v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Global Adaptation meets Local Generalization: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for 3D Human Pose Estimation","abstract":"When applying a pre-trained 2D-to-3D human pose lifting model to a target unseen dataset, large performance degradation is commonly encountered due to domain shift issues. We observe that the degradation is caused by two factors: 1) the large distribution gap over global positions of poses between the source and target datasets due to variant camera parameters and settings, and 2) the deficient diversity of local structures of poses in training. To this end, we combine \\textbf{global adaptation} and \\textbf{local generalization} in \\textit{PoseDA}, a simple yet effective framework of unsupervised domain adaptation for 3D human pose estimation. Specifically, global adaptation aims to align global positions of poses from the source domain to the target domain with a proposed global position alignment (GPA) module. And local generalization is designed to enhance the diversity of 2D-3D pose mapping with a local pose augmentation (LPA) module. These modules bring significant performance improvement without introducing additional learnable parameters. In addition, we propose local pose augmentation (LPA) to enhance the diversity of 3D poses following an adversarial training scheme consisting of 1) a augmentation generator that generates the parameters of pre-defined pose transformations and 2) an anchor discriminator to ensure the reality and quality of the augmented data. Our approach can be applicable to almost all 2D-3D lifting models. \\textit{PoseDA} achieves 61.3 mm of MPJPE on MPI-INF-3DHP under a cross-dataset evaluation setup, improving upon the previous state-of-the-art method by 10.2\\%.","created":"2023-03-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16456v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, it is still challenging to reconstruct the continuous motions of 3D structures from hundreds of thousands of noisy and randomly oriented 2D cryo-EM images. Existing methods based on coordinate-based neural networks show compelling results to model continuous conformations of 3D structures in the Fourier domain, but they suffer from a limited ability to model local flexible regions and lack interpretability. We propose a novel approach, cryoFormer, that utilizes a transformer-based network architecture for continuous heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction. We for the first time directly reconstruct continuous conformations of 3D structures using an implicit feature volume in the 3D spatial domain. A novel deformation transformer decoder further improves reconstruction quality and, more importantly, locates and robustly tackles flexible 3D regions caused by conformations. In experiments, our method outperforms current approaches on three public datasets (1 synthetic and 2 experimental) and a new synthetic dataset of PEDV spike protein. The code and new synthetic dataset will be released for better reproducibility of our results.

We profit from the high-quality sample gathered with HARPS and UVES, in order to search for Li-rich giants and to identify the Li enrichment mechanisms responsible. We derive stellar parameters for 247 stars belonging to 32 open clusters, with 0.07 Ga < ages < 3.6 Ga. We employed the spectral synthesis technique code FASMA for the abundance analysis of 228 stars from our sample. We also determined ages, distances, and extinction using astrometry and photometry from Gaia and PARSEC isochrones to constrain their evolutionary stage. Our sample covers a wide range of stellar masses from 1 to more than 6 solar masses where the majority of the masses are above 2 solar masses. We have found 14 canonical Li-rich giant stars which have experienced the first dredge-up. This corresponds to 6% of our total sample, which is higher than what is typically found for field stars. Apart from the canonical limit, we use the maximum Li abundance of the progenitor stars as a criterion for Li enrichment. We find Li enhancement also among eight stars which have passed the first dredge up and show strong Li lines based on the fact that stars at the same evolutionary stage in the same cluster have significantly different Li abundances. We confirm that giants with higher Li abundance correspond to a higher fraction of fast-rotating giants, suggesting a connection between Li enhancement and stellar rotation as predicted by stellar models. Our Li-rich giants are found in various evolutionary stages implying that no unique Li production mechanism is responsible for Li enrichment but rather different intrinsic or external mechanisms can be simultaneously at play.","created":"2023-03-28","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16124v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

But quality diversity is not efficient in very expensive problems, needing 100.000s of evaluations. Even with the assistance of surrogate models, quality diversity needs 100s or even 1000s of evaluations, which can make it use infeasible. In this study we try to tackle this problem by using a pre-optimization strategy on a lower-dimensional optimization problem and then map the solutions to a higher-dimensional case. For a use case to design buildings that minimize wind nuisance, we show that we can predict flow features around 3D buildings from 2D flow features around building footprints. For a diverse set of building designs, by sampling the space of 2D footprints with a quality diversity algorithm, a predictive model can be trained that is more accurate than when trained on a set of footprints that were selected with a space-filling algorithm like the Sobol sequence. Simulating only 16 buildings in 3D, a set of 1024 building designs with low predicted wind nuisance is created. We show that we can produce better machine learning models by producing training data with quality diversity instead of using common sampling techniques.

We tailor our approach to the task of learning an adaptive position and attitude control policy to track trajectories under challenging disturbances on a multirotor. Our evaluation is performed in a high-fidelity simulation environment and shows that a high-quality adaptive policy can be obtained in about $1.3$ hours.

While earlier works have predicted the material characterization properties of different thermoelectric materials using various techniques, implementation of machine learning models to predict the power factor of bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) during the AM process has not been explored. This is important as Bi2Te3 is a standard material for low temperature applications. Thus, we used data about manufacturing processing parameters involved and in-situ sensor monitoring data collected during AM of Bi2Te3, to train different machine learning models in order to predict its thermoelectric power factor. We implemented supervised machine learning techniques using 80% training and 20% test data and further used the permutation feature importance method to identify important processing parameters and in-situ sensor features which were best at predicting power factor of the material. Ensemble-based methods like random forest, AdaBoost classifier, and bagging classifier performed the best in predicting power factor with the highest accuracy of 90% achieved by the bagging classifier model. Additionally, we found the top 15 processing parameters and in-situ sensor features to characterize the material manufacturing property like power factor. These features could further be optimized to maximize power factor of the thermoelectric material and improve the quality of the products built using this material.","created":"2023-03-28","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15663v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this work, we study algorithms that can scale up to large graphs and important numbers of commodities. We present and analyze in detail a heuristic based on the linear relaxation of the problem and randomized rounding. We provide empirical evidence that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art resolution methods either by its scaling performance or by the quality of its solutions. We provide a variation of the heuristic which has the same approximation factor as the state-of-the-art approximation algorithm. We also derive a tighter analysis for the approximation factor of both the variation and the state-of-the-art algorithm. We introduce a new objective function for the unsplittable flow problem and discuss its differences with the classical congestion objective function. Finally, we discuss the gap in practical performance and theoretical guarantees between all the aforementioned algorithms.","created":"2023-03-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15550v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Few-Shot Domain Adaptation for Low Light RAW Image Enhancement","abstract":"Enhancing practical low light raw images is a difficult task due to severe noise and color distortions from short exposure time and limited illumination. Despite the success of existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based methods, their performance is not adaptable to different camera domains. In addition, such methods also require large datasets with short-exposure and corresponding long-exposure ground truth raw images for each camera domain, which is tedious to compile. To address this issue, we present a novel few-shot domain adaptation method to utilize the existing source camera labeled data with few labeled samples from the target camera to improve the target domain's enhancement quality in extreme low-light imaging. Our experiments show that only ten or fewer labeled samples from the target camera domain are sufficient to achieve similar or better enhancement performance than training a model with a large labeled target camera dataset. To support research in this direction, we also present a new low-light raw image dataset captured with a Nikon camera, comprising short-exposure and their corresponding long-exposure ground truth images.","created":"2023-03-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15528v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, training a diffusion model from scratch is computationally expensive. This highlights the need to investigate the possibility of training these models iteratively, reusing computation while the data distribution changes. In this study, we take the first step in this direction and evaluate the continual learning (CL) properties of diffusion models. We begin by benchmarking the most common CL methods applied to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), where we note the strong performance of the experience replay with the reduced rehearsal coefficient. Furthermore, we provide insights into the dynamics of forgetting, which exhibit diverse behavior across diffusion timesteps. We also uncover certain pitfalls of using the bits-per-dimension metric for evaluating CL.","created":"2023-03-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15342v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, these models still struggle in a variety of ways, including aspects of translation that for a human are the easiest - for instance, correctly translating common nouns. This work explores a cheap and abundant resource to combat this problem: bilingual lexica. We test the efficacy of bilingual lexica in a real-world set-up, on 200-language translation models trained on web-crawled text. We present several findings: (1) using lexical data augmentation, we demonstrate sizable performance gains for unsupervised translation; (2) we compare several families of data augmentation, demonstrating that they yield similar improvements, and can be combined for even greater improvements; (3) we demonstrate the importance of carefully curated lexica over larger, noisier ones, especially with larger models; and (4) we compare the efficacy of multilingual lexicon data versus human-translated parallel data. Finally, we open-source GATITOS (available at https://github.com/google-research/url-nlp/tree/main/gatitos), a new multilingual lexicon for 26 low-resource languages, which had the highest performance among lexica in our experiments.","created":"2023-03-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15265v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Here, we explore how far generated data can aid real data in improving the performance of Neural Networks. In this work, we consider facial expression recognition since it requires challenging local data generation at the level of local regions such as mouth, eyebrows, etc, rather than simple augmentation. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide an alternative method for generating such local deformations but they need further validation. To answer our question, we consider noncomplex Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based classifiers for recognizing Ekman emotions. For the data generation process, we consider generating facial expressions (FEs) by relying on two GANs. The first generates a random identity while the second imposes facial deformations on top of it. We consider training the CNN classifier using FEs from: real-faces, GANs-generated, and finally using a combination of real and GAN-generated faces. We determine an upper bound regarding the data generation quantity to be mixed with the real one which contributes the most to enhancing FER accuracy.

Content-aware image restoration (CARE) methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they often require large amounts of training data and suffer from over-fitting. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework for few-shot microscopy image denoising. Our approach combines a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained via contrastive learning (CL) with two structure preserving loss terms (Structural Similarity Index and Total Variation loss) to further improve the quality of the denoised images using little data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three well-known microscopy imaging datasets, and show that we can drastically reduce the amount of training data while retaining the quality of the denoising, thus alleviating the burden of acquiring paired data and enabling few-shot learning. The proposed framework can be easily extended to other image restoration tasks and has the potential to significantly advance the field of microscopy image analysis.","created":"2023-03-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15214v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"DQSOps: Data Quality Scoring Operations Framework for Data-Driven Applications","abstract":"Data quality assessment has become a prominent component in the successful execution of complex data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) software systems. In practice, real-world applications generate huge volumes of data at speeds. These data streams require analysis and preprocessing before being permanently stored or used in a learning task. Therefore, significant attention has been paid to the systematic management and construction of high-quality datasets. Nevertheless, managing voluminous and high-velocity data streams is usually performed manually (i.e. offline), making it an impractical strategy in production environments. To address this challenge, DataOps has emerged to achieve life-cycle automation of data processes using DevOps principles. However, determining the data quality based on a fitness scale constitutes a complex task within the framework of DataOps. This paper presents a novel Data Quality Scoring Operations (DQSOps) framework that yields a quality score for production data in DataOps workflows. The framework incorporates two scoring approaches, an ML prediction-based approach that predicts the data quality score and a standard-based approach that periodically produces the ground-truth scores based on assessing several data quality dimensions. We deploy the DQSOps framework in a real-world industrial use case. The results show that DQSOps achieves significant computational speedup rates compared to the conventional approach of data quality scoring while maintaining high prediction performance.","created":"2023-03-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15068v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, current studies of text structuralization suffer from a shortage of manually annotated high-quality datasets from different domains and languages, which require specialized professional knowledge. In addition, most IE methods are designed for a specific type of structured data, e.g., entities, relations, and events, making them hard to generalize to others. In this work, we propose a simple and efficient approach to instruct large language model (LLM) to extract a variety of structures from texts. More concretely, we add a prefix and a suffix instruction to indicate the desired IE task and structure type, respectively, before feeding the text into a LLM. Experiments on two LLMs show that this approach can enable language models to perform comparable with other state-of-the-art methods on datasets of a variety of languages and knowledge, and can generalize to other IE sub-tasks via changing the content of instruction. Another benefit of our approach is that it can help researchers to build datasets in low-source and domain-specific scenarios, e.g., fields in finance and law, with low cost.","created":"2023-03-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14956v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

Instruction-tuning not only significantly enhances the model's performance and generalization but also makes the model's generated results more consistent with human speech patterns.

In this paper we explore the performance of large language models based on instruction tuning across different scales of instruction data. An evaluation dataset consisting of 12 major online use cases is constructed in the experiment. With Bloomz-7B1-mt as the base model, the results show that 1) merely increasing the amount of instruction data leads to continuous improvement in tasks such as open-ended generation, 2) in tasks such as math and code, the model performance curve remains quite flat while increasing data size. We further analyze the possible causes of these phenomena and propose potential future research directions such as effectively selecting high-quality training data, scaling base models and training methods specialized for hard tasks.

As hundreds of X-ray projections are needed to reconstruct a high-quality CBCT image (i.e., the attenuation field) in traditional algorithms, sparse-view CBCT reconstruction has become a main focus to reduce radiation dose. Several attempts have been made to solve it while still suffering from insufficient data or poor generalization ability for novel patients. This paper proposes a novel attenuation field encoder-decoder framework by first encoding the volumetric feature from multi-view X-ray projections, then decoding it into the desired attenuation field. The key insight is when building the volumetric feature, we comply with the multi-view CBCT reconstruction nature and emphasize the view consistency property by geometry-aware spatial feature querying and adaptive feature fusing. Moreover, the prior knowledge information learned from data population guarantees our generalization ability when dealing with sparse view input. Comprehensive evaluations have demonstrated the superiority in terms of reconstruction quality, and the downstream application further validates the feasibility of our method in real-world clinics.","created":"2023-03-26","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14739v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

To leverage these extremely sparse labels in network training, we design a novel self-training approach, in which we iteratively conduct the training and label propagation, facilitated by a graph propagation module. Also, we adopt a relation network to generate the per-category prototype to enhance the pseudo label quality and guide the iterative training.

Experimental results on both ScanNet-v2 and S3DIS show that our self-training approach, with extremely-sparse annotations, outperforms all existing weakly supervised methods for 3D semantic and instance segmentation by a large margin, and our results are also comparable to those of the fully supervised counterparts.

Despite the increased efficiency and diversity, the inherent instability of AI models poses a persistent challenge in guiding these models to produce the desired content for users. In this paper, we introduce an integration of wireless perception (WP) with AI-generated content (AIGC) and propose a unified WP-AIGC framework to improve the quality of digital content production. The framework employs a novel multi-scale perception technology to read user's posture, which is difficult to describe accurately in words, and transmits it to the AIGC model as skeleton images. Based on these images and user's service requirements, the AIGC model generates corresponding digital content. Since the production process imposes the user's posture as a constraint on the AIGC model, it makes the generated content more aligned with the user's requirements. Additionally, WP-AIGC can also accept user's feedback, allowing adjustment of computing resources at edge server to improve service quality. Experiments results verify the effectiveness of the WP-AIGC framework, highlighting its potential as a novel approach for guiding AI models in the accurate generation of digital content.","created":"2023-03-26","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14624v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"DeepVecFont-v2: Exploiting Transformers to Synthesize Vector Fonts with Higher Quality","abstract":"Vector font synthesis is a challenging and ongoing problem in the fields of Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. The recently-proposed DeepVecFont achieved state-of-the-art performance by exploiting information of both the image and sequence modalities of vector fonts. However, it has limited capability for handling long sequence data and heavily relies on an image-guided outline refinement post-processing. Thus, vector glyphs synthesized by DeepVecFont still often contain some distortions and artifacts and cannot rival human-designed results. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an enhanced version of DeepVecFont mainly by making the following three novel technical contributions. First, we adopt Transformers instead of RNNs to process sequential data and design a relaxation representation for vector outlines, markedly improving the model's capability and stability of synthesizing long and complex outlines. Second, we propose to sample auxiliary points in addition to control points to precisely align the generated and target B\\'ezier curves or lines. Finally, to alleviate error accumulation in the sequential generation process, we develop a context-based self-refinement module based on another Transformer-based decoder to remove artifacts in the initially synthesized glyphs. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively resolves those intrinsic problems of the original DeepVecFont and outperforms existing approaches in generating English and Chinese vector fonts with complicated structures and diverse styles.","created":"2023-03-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14585v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, recently developed explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques that estimate feature contributions on a model-agnostic level such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have not yet been evaluated for semi-supervised fault diagnosis and prognosis problems characterized by class imbalance and weakly labeled datasets. This paper explores the potential of utilizing Shapley values for a new clustering framework compatible with semi-supervised learning problems, loosening the strict supervision requirement of current XAI techniques. This broad methodology is validated on two case studies: a heatmap image dataset obtained from a semiconductor manufacturing process featuring class imbalance, and a benchmark dataset utilized in the 2021 Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) Data Challenge. Semi-supervised clustering based on Shapley values significantly improves upon clustering quality compared to the fully unsupervised case, deriving information-dense and meaningful clusters that relate to underlying fault diagnosis model predictions. These clusters can also be characterized by high-precision decision rules in terms of original feature values, as demonstrated in the second case study. The rules, limited to 1-2 terms utilizing original feature scales, describe 12 out of the 16 derived equipment failure clusters with precision exceeding 0.85, showcasing the promising utility of the explainable clustering framework for intelligent manufacturing applications.","created":"2023-03-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14581v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"NeRF-DS: Neural Radiance Fields for Dynamic Specular Objects","abstract":"Dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a powerful algorithm capable of rendering photo-realistic novel view images from a monocular RGB video of a dynamic scene. Although it warps moving points across frames from the observation spaces to a common canonical space for rendering, dynamic NeRF does not model the change of the reflected color during the warping. As a result, this approach often fails drastically on challenging specular objects in motion. We address this limitation by reformulating the neural radiance field function to be conditioned on surface position and orientation in the observation space. This allows the specular surface at different poses to keep the different reflected colors when mapped to the common canonical space. Additionally, we add the mask of moving objects to guide the deformation field. As the specular surface changes color during motion, the mask mitigates the problem of failure to find temporal correspondences with only RGB supervision. We evaluate our model based on the novel view synthesis quality with a self-collected dataset of different moving specular objects in realistic environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the reconstruction quality of moving specular objects from monocular RGB videos compared to the existing NeRF models.

{"title":"Shot Noise Reduction in Radiographic and Tomographic Multi-Channel Imaging with Self-Supervised Deep Learning","abstract":"Noise is an important issue for radiographic and tomographic imaging techniques. It becomes particularly critical in applications where additional constraints force a strong reduction of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) per image. These constraints may result from limitations on the maximum available flux or permissible dose and the associated restriction on exposure time. Often, a high SNR per image is traded for the ability to distribute a given total exposure capacity per pixel over multiple channels, thus obtaining additional information about the object by the same total exposure time. These can be energy channels in the case of spectroscopic imaging or time channels in the case of time-resolved imaging. In this paper, we report on a method for improving the quality of noisy multi-channel (time or energy-resolved) imaging datasets. The method relies on the recent Noise2Noise (N2N) self-supervised denoising approach that learns to predict a noise-free signal without access to noise-free data. N2N in turn requires drawing pairs of samples from a data distribution sharing identical signals while being exposed to different samples of random noise. The method is applicable if adjacent channels share enough information to provide images with similar enough information but independent noise. We demonstrate several representative case studies, namely spectroscopic (k-edge) X-ray tomography, in vivo X-ray cine-radiography, and energy-dispersive (Bragg edge) neutron tomography. In all cases, the N2N method shows dramatic improvement and outperforms conventional denoising methods. For such imaging techniques, the method can therefore significantly improve image quality, or maintain image quality with further reduced exposure time per image.","created":"2023-03-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14429v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"LPFF: A Portrait Dataset for Face Generators Across Large Poses","abstract":"The creation of 2D realistic facial images and 3D face shapes using generative networks has been a hot topic in recent years. Existing face generators exhibit exceptional performance on faces in small to medium poses (with respect to frontal faces) but struggle to produce realistic results for large poses. The distorted rendering results on large poses in 3D-aware generators further show that the generated 3D face shapes are far from the distribution of 3D faces in reality. We find that the above issues are caused by the training dataset's pose imbalance.   In this paper, we present LPFF, a large-pose Flickr face dataset comprised of 19,590 high-quality real large-pose portrait images. We utilize our dataset to train a 2D face generator that can process large-pose face images, as well as a 3D-aware generator that can generate realistic human face geometry. To better validate our pose-conditional 3D-aware generators, we develop a new FID measure to evaluate the 3D-level performance. Through this novel FID measure and other experiments, we show that LPFF can help 2D face generators extend their latent space and better manipulate the large-pose data, and help 3D-aware face generators achieve better view consistency and more realistic 3D reconstruction results.","created":"2023-03-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14407v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Unsupervised Domain Adaption with Pixel-level Discriminator for Image-aware Layout Generation","abstract":"Layout is essential for graphic design and poster generation. Recently, applying deep learning models to generate layouts has attracted increasing attention. This paper focuses on using the GAN-based model conditioned on image contents to generate advertising poster graphic layouts, which requires an advertising poster layout dataset with paired product images and graphic layouts. However, the paired images and layouts in the existing dataset are collected by inpainting and annotating posters, respectively. There exists a domain gap between inpainted posters (source domain data) and clean product images (target domain data). Therefore, this paper combines unsupervised domain adaption techniques to design a GAN with a novel pixel-level discriminator (PD), called PDA-GAN, to generate graphic layouts according to image contents. The PD is connected to the shallow level feature map and computes the GAN loss for each input-image pixel. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that PDA-GAN can achieve state-of-the-art performances and generate high-quality image-aware graphic layouts for advertising posters.","created":"2023-03-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14377v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Distributed Multi-Agent Deep Q-Learning for Fast Roaming in IEEE 802.11ax Wi-Fi Systems","abstract":"The innovation of Wi-Fi 6, IEEE 802.11ax, was be approved as the next sixth-generation (6G) technology of wireless local area networks (WLANs) by improving the fundamental performance of latency, throughput, and so on. The main technical feature of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) supports multi-users to transmit respective data concurrently via the corresponding access points (APs). However, the conventional IEEE 802.11 protocol for Wi-Fi roaming selects the target AP only depending on received signal strength indication (RSSI) which is obtained by the received Response frame from the APs. In the long term, it may lead to congestion in a single channel under the scenarios of dense users further increasing the association delay and packet drop rate, even reducing the quality of service (QoS) of the overall system. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent deep Q-learning for fast roaming (MADAR) algorithm to effectively minimize the latency during the station roaming for Smart Warehouse in Wi-Fi 6 system. The MADAR algorithm considers not only RSSI but also channel state information (CSI), and through online neural network learning and weighting adjustments to maximize the reward of the action selected from Epsilon-Greedy. Compared to existing benchmark methods, the MADAR algorithm has been demonstrated for improved roaming latency by analyzing the simulation result and realistic dataset.","created":"2023-03-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01210v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"DiracDiffusion: Denoising and Incremental Reconstruction with Assured Data-Consistency","abstract":"Diffusion models have established new state of the art in a multitude of computer vision tasks, including image restoration. Diffusion-based inverse problem solvers generate reconstructions of exceptional visual quality from heavily corrupted measurements. However, in what is widely known as the perception-distortion trade-off, the price of perceptually appealing reconstructions is often paid in declined distortion metrics, such as PSNR. Distortion metrics measure faithfulness to the observation, a crucial requirement in inverse problems. In this work, we propose a novel framework for inverse problem solving, namely we assume that the observation comes from a stochastic degradation process that gradually degrades and noises the original clean image. We learn to reverse the degradation process in order to recover the clean image. Our technique maintains consistency with the original measurement throughout the reverse process, and allows for great flexibility in trading off perceptual quality for improved distortion metrics and sampling speedup via early-stopping. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method on different high-resolution datasets and inverse problems, achieving great improvements over other state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with respect to both perceptual and distortion metrics.

{"title":"Edge Selection and Clustering for Federated Learning in Optical Inter-LEO Satellite Constellation","abstract":"Low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites have been prosperously deployed for various Earth observation missions due to its capability of collecting a large amount of image or sensor data. However, traditionally, the data training process is performed in the terrestrial cloud server, which leads to a high transmission overhead. With the recent development of LEO, it is more imperative to provide ultra-dense LEO constellation with enhanced on-board computation capability. Benefited from it, we have proposed a collaborative federated learning over LEO satellite constellation (FedLEO). We allocate the entire process on LEOs with low payload inter-satellite transmissions, whilst the low-delay terrestrial gateway server (GS) only takes care for initial signal controlling. The GS initially selects an LEO server, whereas its LEO clients are all determined by clustering mechanism and communication capability through the optical inter-satellite links (ISLs). The re-clustering of changing LEO server will be executed once with low communication quality of FedLEO. In the simulations, we have numerically analyzed the proposed FedLEO under practical Walker-based LEO constellation configurations along with MNIST training dataset for classification mission. The proposed FedLEO outperforms the conventional centralized and distributed architectures with higher classification accuracy as well as comparably lower latency of joint communication and computing.","created":"2023-03-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16071v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"GPU-accelerated Matrix Cover Algorithm for Multiple Patterning Layout Decomposition","abstract":"Multiple patterning lithography (MPL) is regarded as one of the most promising ways of overcoming the resolution limitations of conventional optical lithography due to the delay of next-generation lithography technology. As the feature size continues to decrease, layout decomposition for multiple patterning lithography (MPLD) technology is becoming increasingly crucial for improving the manufacturability in advanced nodes. The decomposition process refers to assigning the layout features to different mask layers according to the design rules and density requirements. When the number of masks $k \\geq 3$, the MPLD problems are NP-hard and thus may suffer from runtime overhead for practical designs. However, the number of layout patterns is increasing exponentially in industrial layouts, which hinders the runtime performance of MPLD models. In this research, we substitute the CPU's dance link data structure with parallel GPU matrix operations to accelerate the solution for exact cover-based MPLD algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our system is capable of full-scale, lightning-fast layout decomposition, which can achieve more than 10$\\times$ speed-up without quality degradation compared to state-of-the-art layout decomposition methods.","created":"2023-03-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14335v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Optimizing Sepsis Care through Heuristics Methods in Process Mining: A Trajectory Analysis","abstract":"Process mining can help acquire insightful knowledge and heighten the system's performance. In this study, we surveyed the trajectories of 1050 sepsis patients in a regional hospital in the Netherlands from the registration to the discharge phase. Based on this real-world case study, the event log comprises events and activities related to the emergency ward, admission to hospital wards, and discharge enriched with data from lab experiments and triage checklists. At first, we aim to discover this process through Heuristics Miner (HM) and Inductive Miner (IM) methods. Then, we analyze a systematic process model based on organizational information and knowledge. Besides, we address conformance checking given medical guidelines for these patients and monitor the related flows on the systematic process model. The results show that HM and IM are inadequate in identifying the relevant process. However, using a systematic process model based on expert knowledge and organizational information resulted in an average fitness of 97.8%, a simplicity of 77.7%, and a generalization of 80.2%. The analyses demonstrate that process mining can shed light on the patient flow in the hospital and inspect the day-to-day clinical performance versus medical guidelines. Also, the process models obtained by the HM and IM methods cannot provide a concrete comprehension of the process structure for stakeholders compared to the systematic process model. The implications of our findings include the potential for process mining to improve the quality of healthcare services, optimize resource allocation, and reduce costs. Our study also highlights the importance of considering expert knowledge and organizational information in developing effective process models.","created":"2023-03-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14328v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

One primary obstacle here is the lack of high quality stylized 3D training data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework \\emph{AgileGAN3D} that can produce 3D artistically appealing and personalized portraits with detailed geometry. New stylization can be obtained with just a few (around 20) unpaired 2D exemplars. We achieve this by first leveraging existing 2D stylization capabilities, \\emph{style prior creation}, to produce a large amount of augmented 2D style exemplars. These augmented exemplars are generated with accurate camera pose labels, as well as paired real face images, which prove to be critical for the downstream 3D stylization task. Capitalizing on the recent advancement of 3D-aware GAN models, we perform \\emph{guided transfer learning} on a pretrained 3D GAN generator to produce multi-view-consistent stylized renderings. In order to achieve 3D GAN inversion that can preserve subject's identity well, we incorporate \\emph{multi-view consistency loss} in the training of our encoder. Our pipeline demonstrates strong capability in turning user photos into a diverse range of 3D artistic portraits.

Conversational agents have shown to be a promising technology to alleviate some of these issues. In the form of digital health assistants, they have the potential to improve the everyday life of the elderly and chronically ill people. This includes, for example, medication reminders, routine checks, or social chit-chat. In addition, conversational agents can satisfy the fundamental need of having access to information about daily news or local events, which enables individuals to stay informed and connected with the world around them. However, finding relevant news sources and navigating the plethora of news articles available online can be overwhelming, particularly for those who may have limited technological literacy or health-related impairments. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative solution that combines knowledge graphs and conversational agents for news search in assisted living. By leveraging graph databases to semantically structure news data and implementing an intuitive voice-based interface, our system can help care-dependent people to easily discover relevant news articles and give personalized recommendations.

{"title":"A Self-supervised Framework for Improved Data-Driven Monitoring of Stress via Multi-modal Passive Sensing","abstract":"Recent advances in remote health monitoring systems have significantly benefited patients and played a crucial role in improving their quality of life. However, while physiological health-focused solutions have demonstrated increasing success and maturity, mental health-focused applications have seen comparatively limited success in spite of the fact that stress and anxiety disorders are among the most common issues people deal with in their daily lives. In the hopes of furthering progress in this domain through the development of a more robust analytic framework for the measurement of indicators of mental health, we propose a multi-modal semi-supervised framework for tracking physiological precursors of the stress response. Our methodology enables utilizing multi-modal data of differing domains and resolutions from wearable devices and leveraging them to map short-term episodes to semantically efficient embeddings for a given task. Additionally, we leverage an inter-modality contrastive objective, with the advantages of rendering our framework both modular and scalable. The focus on optimizing both local and global aspects of our embeddings via a hierarchical structure renders transferring knowledge and compatibility with other devices easier to achieve. In our pipeline, a task-specific pooling based on an attention mechanism, which estimates the contribution of each modality on an instance level, computes the final embeddings for observations. This additionally provides a thorough diagnostic insight into the data characteristics and highlights the importance of signals in the broader view of predicting episodes annotated per mental health status. We perform training experiments using a corpus of real-world data on perceived stress, and our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in performance improvements.","created":"2023-03-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14267v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"CIFAKE: Image Classification and Explainable Identification of AI-Generated Synthetic Images","abstract":"Recent technological advances in synthetic data have enabled the generation of images with such high quality that human beings cannot tell the difference between real-life photographs and Artificial Intelligence (AI) generated images. Given the critical necessity of data reliability and authentication, this article proposes to enhance our ability to recognise AI-generated images through computer vision. Initially, a synthetic dataset is generated that mirrors the ten classes of the already available CIFAR-10 dataset with latent diffusion which provides a contrasting set of images for comparison to real photographs. The model is capable of generating complex visual attributes, such as photorealistic reflections in water. The two sets of data present as a binary classification problem with regard to whether the photograph is real or generated by AI. This study then proposes the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images into two categories; Real or Fake. Following hyperparameter tuning and the training of 36 individual network topologies, the optimal approach could correctly classify the images with 92.98% accuracy. Finally, this study implements explainable AI via Gradient Class Activation Mapping to explore which features within the images are useful for classification. Interpretation reveals interesting concepts within the image, in particular, noting that the actual entity itself does not hold useful information for classification; instead, the model focuses on small visual imperfections in the background of the images. The complete dataset engineered for this study, referred to as the CIFAKE dataset, is made publicly available to the research community for future work.","created":"2023-03-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14126v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

For this reason, its execution has been hindered in big data scenarios, where clustering had to be evaluated otherwise.

We assume three main virtues of a good dataset collected for a model training to be label quality, diversity, and completeness. We compare the effects of those virtues on the model performance using open medical CT datasets and conclude, that quality is more important than diversity early during labeling; the diversity, in turn, is more important than completeness. Based on this conclusion and additional experiments, we propose a labeling procedure for the segmentation of tomographic images to minimize efforts spent on labeling while maximizing the model performance.","created":"2023-03-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14089v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Best of Both Worlds: Multimodal Contrastive Learning with Tabular and Imaging Data","abstract":"Medical datasets and especially biobanks, often contain extensive tabular data with rich clinical information in addition to images. In practice, clinicians typically have less data, both in terms of diversity and scale, but still wish to deploy deep learning solutions. Combined with increasing medical dataset sizes and expensive annotation costs, the necessity for unsupervised methods that can pretrain multimodally and predict unimodally has risen.   To address these needs, we propose the first self-supervised contrastive learning framework that takes advantage of images and tabular data to train unimodal encoders. Our solution combines SimCLR and SCARF, two leading contrastive learning strategies, and is simple and effective. In our experiments, we demonstrate the strength of our framework by predicting risks of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease (CAD) using cardiac MR images and 120 clinical features from 40,000 UK Biobank subjects. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our approach to natural images using the DVM car advertisement dataset.   We take advantage of the high interpretability of tabular data and through attribution and ablation experiments find that morphometric tabular features, describing size and shape, have outsized importance during the contrastive learning process and improve the quality of the learned embeddings. Finally, we introduce a novel form of supervised contrastive learning, label as a feature (LaaF), by appending the ground truth label as a tabular feature during multimodal pretraining, outperforming all supervised contrastive baselines.","created":"2023-03-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14080v3","tag":"data-quality"}}

Lack of data and information deficiency on biodiversity, but also budget constraints and insufficient financial and technical capacity, impede sound policy design and effective implementation of conservation and management measures. The problem is further exacerbated by the lack of harmonized indicators and databases to assess conservation needs and monitor biodiversity losses. We review challenges with biodiversity data (availability, quality, usability, and database access) as a key limiting factor that impact funding and governance. We also evaluate the drivers of both ecosystems change and biodiversity loss as a central piece of knowledge to develop and implement effective policies. While the continent focuses more on the latter, we argue that the two are complementary in shaping restoration and management solutions. We thus underscore the importance of establishing monitoring programs focusing on biodiversity-ecosystem linkages in order to inform evidence-based decisions in ecosystem conservation and restoration in Africa.","created":"2023-03-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13984v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Due to their data-driven character, they bear the potential to handle signal noise efficiently, but its influence on the accuracy of these methods is still unclear. Therefore, we benchmark the influence of four types of noise on the accuracy of a Deep Learning-based method for atrial fibrillation detection in 12-lead electrocardiograms. We use a subset of a publicly available dataset (PTBXL) and use the metadata provided by human experts regarding noise for assigning a signal quality to each electrocardiogram. Furthermore, we compute a quantitative signal-to-noise ratio for each electrocardiogram. We analyze the accuracy of the Deep Learning model with respect to both metrics and observe that the method can robustly identify atrial fibrillation, even in cases signals are labelled by human experts as being noisy on multiple leads. False positive and false negative rates are slightly worse for data being labelled as noisy. Interestingly, data annotated as showing baseline drift noise results in an accuracy very similar to data without. We conclude that the issue of processing noisy electrocardiography data can be addressed successfully by Deep Learning methods that might not need preprocessing as many conventional methods do.","created":"2023-03-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13915v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Nonetheless, we find that the synthetic samples constructed in existing ZSQ methods can be easily fitted by models. Accordingly, quantized models obtained by these methods suffer from significant performance degradation on hard samples. To address this issue, we propose HArd sample Synthesizing and Training (HAST). Specifically, HAST pays more attention to hard samples when synthesizing samples and makes synthetic samples hard to fit when training quantized models. HAST aligns features extracted by full-precision and quantized models to ensure the similarity between features extracted by these two models.

{"title":"Evidence-aware multi-modal data fusion and its application to total knee replacement prediction","abstract":"Deep neural networks have been widely studied for predicting a medical condition, such as total knee replacement (TKR). It has shown that data of different modalities, such as imaging data, clinical variables and demographic information, provide complementary information and thus can improve the prediction accuracy together. However, the data sources of various modalities may not always be of high quality, and each modality may have only partial information of medical condition. Thus, predictions from different modalities can be opposite, and the final prediction may fail in the presence of such a conflict. Therefore, it is important to consider the reliability of each source data and the prediction output when making a final decision. In this paper, we propose an evidence-aware multi-modal data fusion framework based on the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). The backbone models contain an image branch, a non-image branch and a fusion branch. For each branch, there is an evidence network that takes the extracted features as input and outputs an evidence score, which is designed to represent the reliability of the output from the current branch. The output probabilities along with the evidence scores from multiple branches are combined with the Dempster's combination rule to make a final prediction. Experimental results on the public OA initiative (OAI) dataset for the TKR prediction task show the superiority of the proposed fusion strategy on various backbone models.","created":"2023-03-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13810v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

State-of-the-art systems respond to users in the same way regardless of their personalities, although personalizing dialogues can lead to higher levels of adoption and better user experiences. Building personalized dialog systems is an important, yet challenging endeavor and only a handful of works took on the challenge. Most existing works rely on supervised learning approaches and require laborious and expensive labeled training data for each user profile. Additionally, collecting and labeling data for each user profile is virtually impossible. In this work, we propose a novel framework, P-ToD, to personalize task-oriented dialog systems capable of adapting to a wide range of user profiles in an unsupervised fashion using a zero-shot generalizable reward function. P-ToD uses a pre-trained GPT-2 as a backbone model and works in three phases. Phase one performs task-specific training. Phase two kicks off unsupervised personalization by leveraging the proximal policy optimization algorithm that performs policy gradients guided by the zero-shot generalizable reward function. Our novel reward function can quantify the quality of the generated responses even for unseen profiles. The optional final phase fine-tunes the personalized model using a few labeled training examples. We conduct extensive experimental analysis using the personalized bAbI dialogue benchmark for five tasks and up to 180 diverse user profiles.

The core of our approach is a two-stage feature-space alignment strategy that leverages a pre-trained single-view reconstruction (SVR) model to map CLIP features to shapes: to begin with, map the CLIP image feature to the detail-rich 3D shape space of the SVR model, then map the CLIP text feature to the 3D shape space through encouraging the CLIP-consistency between rendered images and the input text. Besides, to extend beyond the generative capability of the SVR model, we design a text-guided 3D shape stylization module that can enhance the output shapes with novel structures and textures. Further, we exploit pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to enhance the generative diversity, fidelity, and stylization capability. Our approach is generic, flexible, and scalable, and it can be easily integrated with various SVR models to expand the generative space and improve the generative fidelity.

To efficiently store and transmit point clouds, compression methods have been developed, but they often result in a degradation of quality. To reduce color distortion in point clouds, we propose a graph-based quality enhancement network (GQE-Net) that uses geometry information as an auxiliary input and graph convolution blocks to extract local features efficiently. Specifically, we use a parallel-serial graph attention module with a multi-head graph attention mechanism to focus on important points or features and help them fuse together. Additionally, we design a feature refinement module that takes into account the normals and geometry distance between points. To work within the limitations of GPU memory capacity, the distorted point cloud is divided into overlap-allowed 3D patches, which are sent to GQE-Net for quality enhancement.

{"title":"TEGLO: High Fidelity Canonical Texture Mapping from Single-View Images","abstract":"Recent work in Neural Fields (NFs) learn 3D representations from class-specific single view image collections. However, they are unable to reconstruct the input data preserving high-frequency details. Further, these methods do not disentangle appearance from geometry and hence are not suitable for tasks such as texture transfer and editing. In this work, we propose TEGLO (Textured EG3D-GLO) for learning 3D representations from single view in-the-wild image collections for a given class of objects. We accomplish this by training a conditional Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) without any explicit 3D supervision. We equip our method with editing capabilities by creating a dense correspondence mapping to a 2D canonical space. We demonstrate that such mapping enables texture transfer and texture editing without requiring meshes with shared topology. Our key insight is that by mapping the input image pixels onto the texture space we can achieve near perfect reconstruction (>= 74 dB PSNR at 1024^2 resolution). Our formulation allows for high quality 3D consistent novel view synthesis with high-frequency details at megapixel image resolution.","created":"2023-03-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13743v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Natural language processing to automatically extract the presence and severity of esophagitis in notes of patients undergoing radiotherapy","abstract":"Radiotherapy (RT) toxicities can impair survival and quality-of-life, yet remain under-studied. Real-world evidence holds potential to improve our understanding of toxicities, but toxicity information is often only in clinical notes. We developed natural language processing (NLP) models to identify the presence and severity of esophagitis from notes of patients treated with thoracic RT. We fine-tuned statistical and pre-trained BERT-based models for three esophagitis classification tasks: Task 1) presence of esophagitis, Task 2) severe esophagitis or not, and Task 3) no esophagitis vs. grade 1 vs. grade 2-3. Transferability was tested on 345 notes from patients with esophageal cancer undergoing RT.   Fine-tuning PubmedBERT yielded the best performance. The best macro-F1 was 0.92, 0.82, and 0.74 for Task 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Selecting the most informative note sections during fine-tuning improved macro-F1 by over 2% for all tasks. Silver-labeled data improved the macro-F1 by over 3% across all tasks. For the esophageal cancer notes, the best macro-F1 was 0.73, 0.74, and 0.65 for Task 1, 2, and 3, respectively, without additional fine-tuning.   To our knowledge, this is the first effort to automatically extract esophagitis toxicity severity according to CTCAE guidelines from clinic notes. The promising performance provides proof-of-concept for NLP-based automated detailed toxicity monitoring in expanded domains.","created":"2023-03-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13722v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Bayesian Reconstruction of Magnetic Resonance Images using Gaussian Processes","abstract":"A central goal of modern magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is to reduce the time required to produce high-quality images. Efforts have included hardware and software innovations such as parallel imaging, compressed sensing, and deep learning-based reconstruction. Here, we propose and demonstrate a Bayesian method to build statistical libraries of magnetic resonance (MR) images in k-space and use these libraries to identify optimal subsampling paths and reconstruction processes. Specifically, we compute a multivariate normal distribution based upon Gaussian processes using a publicly available library of T1-weighted images of healthy brains. We combine this library with physics-informed envelope functions to only retain meaningful correlations in k-space. This covariance function is then used to select a series of ring-shaped subsampling paths using Bayesian optimization such that they optimally explore space while remaining practically realizable in commercial MRI systems. Combining optimized subsampling paths found for a range of images, we compute a generalized sampling path that, when used for novel images, produces superlative structural similarity and error in comparison to previously reported reconstruction processes (i.e. 96.3% structural similarity and <0.003 normalized mean squared error from sampling only 12.5% of the k-space data). Finally, we use this reconstruction process on pathological data without retraining to show that reconstructed images are clinically useful for stroke identification.","created":"2023-03-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13700v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Attention-based Speech Enhancement Using Human Quality Perception Modelling","abstract":"Perceptually-inspired objective functions such as the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR), and short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), have recently been used to optimize performance of deep-learning-based speech enhancement algorithms. These objective functions, however, do not always strongly correlate with a listener's assessment of perceptual quality, so optimizing with these measures often results in poorer performance in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose an attention-based enhancement approach that uses learned speech embedding vectors from a mean-opinion score (MOS) prediction model and a speech enhancement module to jointly enhance noisy speech. The MOS prediction model estimates the perceptual MOS of speech quality, as assessed by human listeners, directly from the audio signal. The enhancement module also employs a quantized language model that enforces spectral constraints for better speech realism and performance. We train the model using real-world noisy speech data that has been captured in everyday environments and test it using unseen corpora. The results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms other approaches that are optimized with objective measures, where the predicted quality scores strongly correlate with human judgments.","created":"2023-03-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13685v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Detecting Backdoors in Pre-trained Encoders","abstract":"Self-supervised learning in computer vision trains on unlabeled data, such as images or (image, text) pairs, to obtain an image encoder that learns high-quality embeddings for input data. Emerging backdoor attacks towards encoders expose crucial vulnerabilities of self-supervised learning, since downstream classifiers (even further trained on clean data) may inherit backdoor behaviors from encoders. Existing backdoor detection methods mainly focus on supervised learning settings and cannot handle pre-trained encoders especially when input labels are not available. In this paper, we propose DECREE, the first backdoor detection approach for pre-trained encoders, requiring neither classifier headers nor input labels. We evaluate DECREE on over 400 encoders trojaned under 3 paradigms. We show the effectiveness of our method on image encoders pre-trained on ImageNet and OpenAI's CLIP 400 million image-text pairs. Our method consistently has a high detection accuracy even if we have only limited or no access to the pre-training dataset.","created":"2023-03-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15180v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent times compels one to ask: can these systems be used for data generation? In this article, we explore prompting multilingual LLMs in a zero-shot manner to create code-mixed data for five languages in South East Asia (SEA) -- Indonesian, Malay, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, as well as the creole language Singlish. We find that ChatGPT shows the most potential, capable of producing code-mixed text 68% of the time when the term \"code-mixing\" is explicitly defined. Moreover, both ChatGPT's and InstructGPT's (davinci-003) performances in generating Singlish texts are noteworthy, averaging a 96% success rate across a variety of prompts. Their code-mixing proficiency, however, is dampened by word choice errors that lead to semantic inaccuracies. Other multilingual models such as BLOOMZ and Flan-T5-XXL are unable to produce code-mixed texts altogether. By highlighting the limited promises of LLMs in a specific form of low-resource data generation, we call for a measured approach when applying similar techniques to other data-scarce NLP contexts.","created":"2023-03-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13592v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Plotting Behind the Scenes: Towards Learnable Game Engines","abstract":"Game engines are powerful tools in computer graphics. Their power comes at the immense cost of their development. In this work, we present a framework to train game-engine-like neural models, solely from monocular annotated videos. The result-a Learnable Game Engine (LGE)-maintains states of the scene, objects and agents in it, and enables rendering the environment from a controllable viewpoint. Similarly to a game engine, it models the logic of the game and the underlying rules of physics, to make it possible for a user to play the game by specifying both high- and low-level action sequences. Most captivatingly, our LGE unlocks the director's mode, where the game is played by plotting behind the scenes, specifying high-level actions and goals for the agents in the form of language and desired states. This requires learning \"game AI\", encapsulated by our animation model, to navigate the scene using high-level constraints, play against an adversary, devise the strategy to win a point. The key to learning such game AI is the exploitation of a large and diverse text corpus, collected in this work, describing detailed actions in a game and used to train our animation model. To render the resulting state of the environment and its agents, we use a compositional NeRF representation used in our synthesis model. To foster future research, we present newly collected, annotated and calibrated large-scale Tennis and Minecraft datasets. Our method significantly outperforms existing neural video game simulators in terms of rendering quality. Besides, our LGEs unlock applications beyond capabilities of the current state of the art.

In this paper, we introduce a new task of zero-shot text-to-video generation and propose a low-cost approach (without any training or optimization) by leveraging the power of existing text-to-image synthesis methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion), making them suitable for the video domain.   Our key modifications include (i) enriching the latent codes of the generated frames with motion dynamics to keep the global scene and the background time consistent; and (ii) reprogramming frame-level self-attention using a new cross-frame attention of each frame on the first frame, to preserve the context, appearance, and identity of the foreground object.   Experiments show that this leads to low overhead, yet high-quality and remarkably consistent video generation. Moreover, our approach is not limited to text-to-video synthesis but is also applicable to other tasks such as conditional and content-specialized video generation, and Video Instruct-Pix2Pix, i.e., instruction-guided video editing.

{"title":"Medical diffusion on a budget: textual inversion for medical image generation","abstract":"Diffusion-based models for text-to-image generation have gained immense popularity due to recent advancements in efficiency, accessibility, and quality. Although it is becoming increasingly feasible to perform inference with these systems using consumer-grade GPUs, training them from scratch still requires access to large datasets and significant computational resources. In the case of medical image generation, the availability of large, publicly accessible datasets that include text reports is limited due to legal and ethical concerns. While training a diffusion model on a private dataset may address this issue, it is not always feasible for institutions lacking the necessary computational resources. This work demonstrates that pre-trained Stable Diffusion models, originally trained on natural images, can be adapted to various medical imaging modalities by training text embeddings with textual inversion. In this study, we conducted experiments using medical datasets comprising only 100 samples from three medical modalities. Embeddings were trained in a matter of hours, while still retaining diagnostic relevance in image generation. Experiments were designed to achieve several objectives. Firstly, we fine-tuned the training and inference processes of textual inversion, revealing that larger embeddings and more examples are required. Secondly, we validated our approach by demonstrating a 2\\% increase in the diagnostic accuracy (AUC) for detecting prostate cancer on MRI, which is a challenging multi-modal imaging modality, from 0.78 to 0.80. Thirdly, we performed simulations by interpolating between healthy and diseased states, combining multiple pathologies, and inpainting to show embedding flexibility and control of disease appearance. Finally, the embeddings trained in this study are small (less than 1 MB), which facilitates easy sharing of medical data with reduced privacy concerns.","created":"2023-03-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13430v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, there is still a considerable gap between the flourishing FL research and real-world scenarios, mainly caused by the characteristics of heterogeneous devices and its scales. Most existing works conduct evaluations with homogeneous devices, which are mismatched with the diversity and variability of heterogeneous devices in real-world scenarios. Moreover, it is challenging to conduct research and development at scale with heterogeneous devices due to limited resources and complex software stacks. These two key factors are important yet underexplored in FL research as they directly impact the FL training dynamics and final performance, making the effectiveness and usability of FL algorithms unclear. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable prototyping system for real-world cross-device FL, FS-Real. It supports heterogeneous device runtime, contains parallelism and robustness enhanced FL server, and provides implementations and extensibility for advanced FL utility features such as personalization, communication compression and asynchronous aggregation. To demonstrate the usability and efficiency of FS-Real, we conduct extensive experiments with various device distributions, quantify and analyze the effect of the heterogeneous device and various scales, and further provide insights and open discussions about real-world FL scenarios.

{"title":"A Generalised Deep Meta-Learning Model for Automated Quality Control of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Images","abstract":"Background and Objectives: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a powerful modality in functional and anatomical assessment for various cardiovascular diseases. Sufficient image quality is essential to achieve proper diagnosis and treatment. A large number of medical images, the variety of imaging artefacts, and the workload of imaging centres are among the things that reveal the necessity of automatic image quality assessment (IQA). However, automated IQA requires access to bulk annotated datasets for training deep learning (DL) models. Labelling medical images is a tedious, costly and time-consuming process, which creates a fundamental challenge in proposing DL-based methods for medical applications. This study aims to present a new method for CMR IQA when there is limited access to annotated datasets. Methods: The proposed generalised deep meta-learning model can evaluate the quality by learning tasks in the prior stage and then fine-tuning the resulting model on a small labelled dataset of the desired tasks. This model was evaluated on the data of over 6,000 subjects from the UK Biobank for five defined tasks, including detecting respiratory motion, cardiac motion, Aliasing and Gibbs ringing artefacts and images without artefacts. Results: The results of extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed model. Besides, comparing the model's accuracy with the domain adaptation model indicates a significant difference by using only 64 annotated images related to the desired tasks. Conclusion: The proposed model can identify unknown artefacts in images with acceptable accuracy, which makes it suitable for medical applications and quality assessment of large cohorts.","created":"2023-03-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13324v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Considerations on the Evaluation of Biometric Quality Assessment Algorithms","abstract":"Quality assessment algorithms can be used to estimate the utility of a biometric sample for the purpose of biometric recognition. \"Error versus Discard Characteristic\" (EDC) plots, and \"partial Area Under Curve\" (pAUC) values of curves therein, are generally used by researchers to evaluate the predictive performance of such quality assessment algorithms. An EDC curve depends on an error type such as the \"False Non Match Rate\" (FNMR), a quality assessment algorithm, a biometric recognition system, a set of comparisons each corresponding to a biometric sample pair, and a comparison score threshold corresponding to a starting error. To compute an EDC curve, comparisons are progressively discarded based on the associated samples' lowest quality scores, and the error is computed for the remaining comparisons. Additionally, a discard fraction limit or range must be selected to compute pAUC values, which can then be used to quantitatively rank quality assessment algorithms.   This paper discusses and analyses various details for this kind of quality assessment algorithm evaluation, including general EDC properties, interpretability improvements for pAUC values based on a hard lower error limit and a soft upper error limit, the use of relative instead of discrete rankings, stepwise vs. linear curve interpolation, and normalisation of quality scores to a [0, 100] integer range. We also analyse the stability of quantitative quality assessment algorithm rankings based on pAUC values across varying pAUC discard fraction limits and starting errors, concluding that higher pAUC discard fraction limits should be preferred. The analyses are conducted both with synthetic data and with real data for a face image quality assessment scenario, with a focus on general modality-independent conclusions for EDC evaluations.","created":"2023-03-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13294v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

The few training samples restrict the performance of FSOD model. Recent text-to-image generation models have shown promising results in generating high-quality images. How applicable these synthetic images are for FSOD tasks remains under-explored. This work extensively studies how synthetic images generated from state-of-the-art text-to-image generators benefit FSOD tasks. We focus on two perspectives: (1) How to use synthetic data for FSOD? (2) How to find representative samples from the large-scale synthetic dataset? We design a copy-paste-based pipeline for using synthetic data. Specifically, saliency object detection is applied to the original generated image, and the minimum enclosing box is used for cropping the main object based on the saliency map. After that, the cropped object is randomly pasted on the image, which comes from the base dataset. We also study the influence of the input text of text-to-image generator and the number of synthetic images used. To construct a representative synthetic training dataset, we maximize the diversity of the selected images via a sample-based and cluster-based method. However, the severe problem of high false positives (FP) ratio of novel categories in FSOD can not be solved by using synthetic data. We propose integrating CLIP, a zero-shot recognition model, into the FSOD pipeline, which can filter 90% of FP by defining a threshold for the similarity score between the detected object and the text of the predicted category. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO validate the effectiveness of our method, in which performance gain is up to 21.9% compared to the few-shot baseline.","created":"2023-03-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13221v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, sending and receiving a huge amount of data is considered to be a main challenge. To address this issue, a new algorithm is required to reduce image bits and represent the data in a compressed form. Nevertheless, image compression is an important application for transferring large files and images. This requires appropriate and efficient transfers in this field to achieve the task and reach the best results.

By compressing the color image, this method analyzes it and divides it into approximate coefficients and detail coefficients after adding the wavelets into MATLAB. With Multi-Resolution Analyses (MRA), the appropriate filter is derived, and the mathematical aspects prove to be validated by testing a new filter and performing its operation. After the decomposition of the rows and upon the process of the reconstruction, taking the inverse of the filter and dealing with the columns of the matrix, the original matrix is improved by measuring the parameters of the image to achieve the best quality of the resulting image, such as the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), compression ratio (CR), bits per pixel (BPP), and mean square error (MSE).","created":"2023-03-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13175v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

We tackle the challenging task of inverting the latent space of pre-trained face recognition models without full model access (i.e. black-box setting). A variety of methods have been proposed in literature for this task, but they have serious shortcomings such as a lack of realistic outputs, long inference times, and strong requirements for the data set and accessibility of the face recognition model. Through an analysis of the black-box inversion problem, we show that the conditional diffusion model loss naturally emerges and that we can effectively sample from the inverse distribution even without an identity-specific loss. Our method, named identity denoising diffusion probabilistic model (ID3PM), leverages the stochastic nature of the denoising diffusion process to produce high-quality, identity-preserving face images with various backgrounds, lighting, poses, and expressions. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of identity preservation and diversity both qualitatively and quantitatively.

{"title":"Forecast-Aware Model Driven LSTM","abstract":"Poor air quality can have a significant impact on human health. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) air quality forecasting guidance is challenged by the increasing presence of extreme air quality events due to extreme weather events such as wild fires and heatwaves. These extreme air quality events further affect human health. Traditional methods used to correct model bias make assumptions about linearity and the underlying distribution. Extreme air quality events tend to occur without a strong signal leading up to the event and this behavior tends to cause existing methods to either under or over compensate for the bias. Deep learning holds promise for air quality forecasting in the presence of extreme air quality events due to its ability to generalize and learn nonlinear problems. However, in the presence of these anomalous air quality events, standard deep network approaches that use a single network for generalizing to future forecasts, may not always provide the best performance even with a full feature-set including geography and meteorology. In this work we describe a method that combines unsupervised learning and a forecast-aware bi-directional LSTM network to perform bias correction for operational air quality forecasting using AirNow station data for ozone and PM2.5 in the continental US. Using an unsupervised clustering method trained on station geographical features such as latitude and longitude, urbanization, and elevation, the learned clusters direct training by partitioning the training data for the LSTM networks. LSTMs are forecast-aware and implemented using a unique way to perform learning forward and backwards in time across forecasting days. When comparing the RMSE of the forecast model to the RMSE of the bias corrected model, the bias corrected model shows significant improvement (27\\% lower RMSE for ozone) over the base forecast.","created":"2023-03-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12963v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Sub-volume-based Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Cone-beam CT Reconstruction from Incomplete Data","abstract":"Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a new approach in the field of computed tomography (CT) with many applicaitons. A primary example is CT reconstruction from incomplete data, such as sparse-view image reconstruction. However, applying DL to sparse-view cone-beam CT (CBCT) remains challenging. Many models learn the mapping from sparse-view CT images to the ground truth but often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. Incorporating sinogram data and performing dual-domain reconstruction improve image quality with artifact suppression, but a straightforward 3D implementation requires storing an entire 3D sinogram in memory and many parameters of dual-domain networks. This remains a major challenge, limiting further research, development and applications. In this paper, we propose a sub-volume-based 3D denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for CBCT image reconstruction from down-sampled data. Our DDPM network, trained on data cubes extracted from paired fully sampled sinograms and down-sampled sinograms, is employed to inpaint down-sampled sinograms.

{"title":"LSTM-based Video Quality Prediction Accounting for Temporal Distortions in Videoconferencing Calls","abstract":"Current state-of-the-art video quality models, such as VMAF, give excellent prediction results by comparing the degraded video with its reference video. However, they do not consider temporal distortions (e.g., frame freezes or skips) that occur during videoconferencing calls. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for modeling such distortions automatically by training an LSTM with subjective quality ratings labeled via crowdsourcing. The videos were collected from live videoconferencing calls in 83 different network conditions. We applied QR codes as markers on the source videos to create aligned references and compute temporal features based on the alignment vectors. Using these features together with VMAF core features, our proposed model achieves a PCC of 0.99 on the validation set. Furthermore, our model outputs per-frame quality that gives detailed insight into the cause of video quality impairments.

{"title":"Constraining f(Q) Cosmology with Standard Sirens","abstract":"In this dissertation, we study two cosmological models based on $f(Q)$ gravity. We resort to mock catalogs of standard siren (SS) events to see whether data from future gravitational wave (GWs) observatories will be able to distinguish these models from $\\Lambda$CDM.   The first model is the most general $f(Q)$ formulation that replicates a $\\Lambda$CDM background, with deviations appearing only at the perturbative level. It has one additional free parameter compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, $\\alpha$, which when set to zero falls back to $\\Lambda$CDM. We show that LIGO-Virgo is unable to constrain $\\alpha$, due to the high error and low redshift of the measurements, whereas LISA and the ET will, with the ET outperforming LISA. The catalogs for both LISA and LIGO-Virgo show non-negligible statistical fluctuations, where we consider three representative catalogs (the best, median and worst), whereas for the ET, only a single catalog is considered, as the number of events is large enough for statistical fluctuations to be neglected. The best LISA catalog is the one with more low redshift events, while the worst LISA catalog features fewer low redshift events. Additionally, if we are to observe a bad LISA catalog, we can rely on data from LIGO-Virgo to improve the quality of the constrains, bringing it closer to a median LISA catalog.   The second model attempts to replace dark energy by making use of a specific form of the function $f(Q)$. We study this model resorting to dynamical system techniques to show the regions in parameter space with viable cosmologies. Using model selection criteria, we show that no number of SS events is, by itself, able to tell this model and $\\Lambda$CDM apart. We then show that if we add current type Ia Supernova (SnIa) data, tensions in this model arise when compared to the constrains set by the SS events.","created":"2023-03-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12674v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"RaBit: Parametric Modeling of 3D Biped Cartoon Characters with a Topological-consistent Dataset","abstract":"Assisting people in efficiently producing visually plausible 3D characters has always been a fundamental research topic in computer vision and computer graphics. Recent learning-based approaches have achieved unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in the area of 3D real human digitization. However, none of the prior works focus on modeling 3D biped cartoon characters, which are also in great demand in gaming and filming. In this paper, we introduce 3DBiCar, the first large-scale dataset of 3D biped cartoon characters, and RaBit, the corresponding parametric model. Our dataset contains 1,500 topologically consistent high-quality 3D textured models which are manually crafted by professional artists. Built upon the data, RaBit is thus designed with a SMPL-like linear blend shape model and a StyleGAN-based neural UV-texture generator, simultaneously expressing the shape, pose, and texture. To demonstrate the practicality of 3DBiCar and RaBit, various applications are conducted, including single-view reconstruction, sketch-based modeling, and 3D cartoon animation. For the single-view reconstruction setting, we find a straightforward global mapping from input images to the output UV-based texture maps tends to lose detailed appearances of some local parts (e.g., nose, ears). Thus, a part-sensitive texture reasoner is adopted to make all important local areas perceived. Experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively. 3DBiCar and RaBit are available at gaplab.cuhk.edu.cn/projects/RaBit.","created":"2023-03-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12564v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Anomaly Detection in Aeronautics Data with Quantum-compatible Discrete Deep Generative Model","abstract":"Deep generative learning cannot only be used for generating new data with statistical characteristics derived from input data but also for anomaly detection, by separating nominal and anomalous instances based on their reconstruction quality. In this paper, we explore the performance of three unsupervised deep generative models -- variational autoencoders (VAEs) with Gaussian, Bernoulli, and Boltzmann priors -- in detecting anomalies in flight-operations data of commercial flights consisting of multivariate time series. We devised two VAE models with discrete latent variables (DVAEs), one with a factorized Bernoulli prior and one with a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) as prior, because of the demand for discrete-variable models in machine-learning applications and because the integration of quantum devices based on two-level quantum systems requires such models. The DVAE with RBM prior, using a relatively simple -- and classically or quantum-mechanically enhanceable -- sampling technique for the evolution of the RBM's negative phase, performed better than the Bernoulli DVAE and on par with the Gaussian model, which has a continuous latent space. Our studies demonstrate the competitiveness of a discrete deep generative model with its Gaussian counterpart on anomaly-detection tasks. Moreover, the DVAE model with RBM prior can be easily integrated with quantum sampling by outsourcing its generative process to measurements of quantum states obtained from a quantum annealer or gate-model device.","created":"2023-03-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12302v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Encoding Binary Concepts in the Latent Space of Generative Models for Enhancing Data Representation","abstract":"Binary concepts are empirically used by humans to generalize efficiently. And they are based on Bernoulli distribution which is the building block of information. These concepts span both low-level and high-level features such as \"large vs small\" and \"a neuron is active or inactive\". Binary concepts are ubiquitous features and can be used to transfer knowledge to improve model generalization. We propose a novel binarized regularization to facilitate learning of binary concepts to improve the quality of data generation in autoencoders. We introduce a binarizing hyperparameter $r$ in data generation process to disentangle the latent space symmetrically. We demonstrate that this method can be applied easily to existing variational autoencoder (VAE) variants to encourage symmetric disentanglement, improve reconstruction quality, and prevent posterior collapse without computation overhead. We also demonstrate that this method can boost existing models to learn more transferable representations and generate more representative samples for the input distribution which can alleviate catastrophic forgetting using generative replay under continual learning settings.","created":"2023-03-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12255v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Our model achieves state-of-the-art generation quality and also enables part-level shape editing and manipulation without any additional training in conditional setup. Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in data generation as well as zero-shot completion and editing via a guided reverse process. Recent research on 3D diffusion models has focused on improving their generation capabilities with various data representations, while the absence of structural information has limited their capability in completion and editing tasks. We thus propose our novel diffusion model using a part-level implicit representation. To effectively learn diffusion with high-dimensional embedding vectors of parts, we propose a cascaded framework, learning diffusion first on a low-dimensional subspace encoding extrinsic parameters of parts and then on the other high-dimensional subspace encoding intrinsic attributes. In the experiments, we demonstrate the outperformance of our method compared with the previous ones both in generation and part-level completion and manipulation tasks.","created":"2023-03-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12236v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Personalized Lightweight Text-to-Speech: Voice Cloning with Adaptive Structured Pruning","abstract":"Personalized TTS is an exciting and highly desired application that allows users to train their TTS voice using only a few recordings. However, TTS training typically requires many hours of recording and a large model, making it unsuitable for deployment on mobile devices. To overcome this limitation, related works typically require fine-tuning a pre-trained TTS model to preserve its ability to generate high-quality audio samples while adapting to the target speaker's voice. This process is commonly referred to as ``voice cloning.'' Although related works have achieved significant success in changing the TTS model's voice, they are still required to fine-tune from a large pre-trained model, resulting in a significant size for the voice-cloned model. In this paper, we propose applying trainable structured pruning to voice cloning. By training the structured pruning masks with voice-cloning data, we can produce a unique pruned model for each target speaker. Our experiments demonstrate that using learnable structured pruning, we can compress the model size to 7 times smaller while achieving comparable voice-cloning performance.","created":"2023-03-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11816v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Consequently, this study compared the writing performance on a narrative topic by ChatGPT and Chinese intermediate English (CIE) learners so as to reveal the chatbot's advantage and disadvantage in writing. The data were analyzed in terms of five discourse components using Coh-Metrix (a special instrument for analyzing language discourses), and the results revealed that ChatGPT performed better than human writers in narrativity, word concreteness, and referential cohesion, but worse in syntactic simplicity and deep cohesion in its initial version. After more revision commands were updated, while the resulting version was facilitated in syntactic simplicity, yet it is still lagged far behind CIE learners' writing in deep cohesion. In addition, the correlation analysis of the discourse components suggests that narrativity was correlated with referential cohesion in both ChatGPT and human writers, but the correlations varied within each group.","created":"2023-03-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11812v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Transfer-Learned Potential Energy Surfaces: Towards Microsecond-Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations in the Gas Phase at CCSD(T) Quality","abstract":"The rise of machine learning has greatly influenced the field of computational chemistry, and that of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in particular. One of its most exciting prospects is the development of accurate, full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) for molecules and clusters, which, however, often require thousands to tens of thousands of ab initio data points restricting the community to medium sized molecules and/or lower levels of theory (e.g. DFT). Transfer learning, which improves a global PES from a lower to a higher level of theory, offers a data efficient alternative requiring only a fraction of the high level data (on the order of 100 are found to be sufficient for malonaldehyde). The present work demonstrates that even with Hartree-Fock theory and a double-zeta basis set as the lower level model, transfer learning yields CCSD(T)-level quality for H-transfer barrier energies, harmonic frequencies and H-transfer tunneling splittings. Most importantly, finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations on the sub-microsecond time scale in the gas phase are possible and the infrared spectra determined from the transfer learned PESs are in good agreement with experiment. It is concluded that routine, long-time atomistic simulations on PESs fulfilling CCSD(T)-standards become possible.","created":"2023-03-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11685v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"SpikeCV: Open a Continuous Computer Vision Era","abstract":"SpikeCV is a new open-source computer vision platform for the spike camera, which is a neuromorphic visual sensor that has developed rapidly in recent years. In the spike camera, each pixel position directly accumulates the light intensity and asynchronously fires spikes. The output binary spikes can reach a frequency of 40,000 Hz. As a new type of visual expression, spike sequence has high spatiotemporal completeness and preserves the continuous visual information of the external world. Taking advantage of the low latency and high dynamic range of the spike camera, many spike-based algorithms have made significant progress, such as high-quality imaging and ultra-high-speed target detection.   To build up a community ecology for the spike vision to facilitate more users to take advantage of the spike camera, SpikeCV provides a variety of ultra-high-speed scene datasets, hardware interfaces, and an easy-to-use modules library. SpikeCV focuses on encapsulation for spike data, standardization for dataset interfaces, modularization for vision tasks, and real-time applications for challenging scenes.

As with most human-in-the-loop approaches, the key criterion for success in AL is to minimize human effort while still attaining high performance. To this end, we employ a transformer-based segmentation network that utilizes a masked-attention mechanism. To enhance the network, tailoring to our task, we introduce a coarse-to-fine model which first uses object-aware masked attention and then a pose-aware one, leveraging a correlation between interactable parts and object poses and leading to improved handling of multiple articulated objects in an image. Our coarse-to-fine active segmentation module learns both 2D instance and 3D pose information using the transformer, which supervises the active segmentation and effectively reduces human effort. Our method achieves close to fully accurate (96% and higher) segmentation results on real images, with 77% time saving over manual effort, where the training data consists of only 16.6% annotated real photographs. At last, we contribute a dataset of 2,550 real photographs with annotated interactable parts, demonstrating its superior quality and diversity over the current best alternative.","created":"2023-03-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11530v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

To address this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel Deep Star-Convexified Lucas-Kanade (PRISE) method for multimodel image alignment by introducing strongly star-convex constraints into the optimization problem. Our basic idea is to enforce the neural network to approximately learn a star-convex loss landscape around the ground truth give any data to facilitate the convergence of the LK method to the ground truth through the high dimensional space defined by the network. This leads to a minimax learning problem, with contrastive (hinge) losses due to the definition of strong star-convexity that are appended to the original loss for training. We also provide an efficient sampling based algorithm to leverage the training cost, as well as some analysis on the quality of the solutions from PRISE.

{"title":"Inversion by Direct Iteration: An Alternative to Denoising Diffusion for Image Restoration","abstract":"Inversion by Direct Iteration (InDI) is a new formulation for supervised image restoration that avoids the so-called ``regression to the mean'' effect and produces more realistic and detailed images than existing regression-based methods. It does this by gradually improving image quality in small steps, similar to generative denoising diffusion models.   Image restoration is an ill-posed problem where multiple high-quality images are plausible reconstructions of a given low-quality input. Therefore, the outcome of a single step regression model is typically an aggregate of all possible explanations, therefore lacking details and realism. The main advantage of InDI is that it does not try to predict the clean target image in a single step but instead gradually improves the image in small steps, resulting in better perceptual quality.   While generative denoising diffusion models also work in small steps, our formulation is distinct in that it does not require knowledge of any analytic form of the degradation process. Instead, we directly learn an iterative restoration process from low-quality and high-quality paired examples. InDI can be applied to virtually any image degradation, given paired training data. In conditional denoising diffusion image restoration the denoising network generates the restored image by repeatedly denoising an initial image of pure noise, conditioned on the degraded input. Contrary to conditional denoising formulations, InDI directly proceeds by iteratively restoring the input low-quality image, producing high-quality results on a variety of image restoration tasks, including motion and out-of-focus deblurring, super-resolution, compression artifact removal, and denoising.","created":"2023-03-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11435v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, these state-of-the-art approaches typically necessitate internal model fine-tuning, external model fine-tuning, or policy optimization over a defined state space. Implementing these methods can prove challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data or the lack of well-defined state space. Moreover, these agents do not possess certain qualities inherent to human decision-making processes, specifically the ability to learn from mistakes. Self-reflection allows humans to efficiently solve novel problems through a process of trial and error. Building on recent research, we propose Reflexion, an approach that endows an agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to enhance its existing reasoning trace and task-specific action choice abilities. To achieve full automation, we introduce a straightforward yet effective heuristic that enables the agent to pinpoint hallucination instances, avoid repetition in action sequences, and, in some environments, construct an internal memory map of the given environment. To assess our approach, we evaluate the agent's ability to complete decision-making tasks in AlfWorld environments and knowledge-intensive, search-based question-and-answer tasks in HotPotQA environments.

{"title":"FullFormer: Generating Shapes Inside Shapes","abstract":"Implicit generative models have been widely employed to model 3D data and have recently proven to be successful in encoding and generating high-quality 3D shapes. This work builds upon these models and alleviates current limitations by presenting the first implicit generative model that facilitates the generation of complex 3D shapes with rich internal geometric details. To achieve this, our model uses unsigned distance fields to represent nested 3D surfaces allowing learning from non-watertight mesh data. We propose a transformer-based autoregressive model for 3D shape generation that leverages context-rich tokens from vector quantized shape embeddings. The generated tokens are decoded into an unsigned distance field which is rendered into a novel 3D shape exhibiting a rich internal structure. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art point cloud generation results on popular classes of 'Cars', 'Planes', and 'Chairs' of the ShapeNet dataset. Additionally, we curate a dataset that exclusively comprises shapes with realistic internal details from the `Cars' class of ShapeNet and demonstrate our method's efficacy in generating these shapes with internal geometry.","created":"2023-03-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11235v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Opportunities and Challenges to Integrate Artificial Intelligence into Manufacturing Systems: Thoughts from a Panel Discussion","abstract":"Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly increase the productivity, quality, and profitability in future manufacturing systems. Traditional mass-production will give way to personalized production, with each item made to order, at the low cost and high-quality consumers have come to expect. Manufacturing systems will have the intelligence to be resilient to multiple disruptions, from small-scale machine breakdowns, to large-scale natural disasters. Products will be made with higher precision and lower variability. While gains have been made towards the development of these factories of the future, many challenges remain to fully realize this vision. To consider the challenges and opportunities associated with this topic, a panel of experts from Industry, Academia, and Government was invited to participate in an active discussion at the 2022 Modeling, Estimation and Control Conference (MECC) held in Jersey City, New Jersey from October 3- 5, 2022. The panel discussion focused on the challenges and opportunities to more fully integrate AI into manufacturing systems. Three overarching themes emerged from the panel discussion. First, to be successful, AI will need to work seamlessly, and in an integrated manner with humans (and vice versa). Second, significant gaps in the infrastructure needed to enable the full potential of AI into the manufacturing ecosystem, including sufficient data availability, storage, and analysis, must be addressed. And finally, improved coordination between universities, industry, and government agencies can facilitate greater opportunities to push the field forward. This article briefly summarizes these three themes, and concludes with a discussion of promising directions.","created":"2023-03-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11139v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Radio and infrared study of the supernova remnant candidate HESS J1912+101","abstract":"Aims: We provide new insights into the gamma-ray emission from HESS J1912+101, a TeV supernova remnant candidate probably associated with the radio pulsar PSR J1913+1011. Methods: We obtained new observations at 1.5 GHz using the VLA in the D configuration, with the purpose of detecting the radio shell of the putative remnant. In addition, we observed a single pointing at 6.0 GHz toward PSR J1913+1011 to look for a radio pulsar wind nebula. We also studied the properties of the surrounding interstellar medium using data of the 13CO, HI, and infrared emissions, obtained from public surveys. Results: We did not find evidence of a radio shell down to the sensitivity of the new image at 1.5 GHz. We detect faint diffuse emission around PSR J1913+1011 at 6.0 GHz, which could represent a radio pulsar wind nebula powered by the pulsar. We find dense ambient gas at 60 km/s, which shows a good spatial correspondence with the TeV emission only in the western and eastern directions. There is also dense gas near the center of HESS J1912+101, where the TeV emission is weak. Using infrared data, we identify an active star-forming region in the western part of the shell. Conclusions: Based on the poor spatial match between the ambient gas and the TeV emission (which shows a good correlation in the western and eastern directions and an anticorrelation in the other directions), we conclude that the hadronic mechanism alone does not give a satisfactory explanation of the gamma rays from HESS J1912+101. Additional contributions may come from leptonic processes in the shell of the supernova remnant, together with contributions from PSR J1913$+$1011 and its pulsar wind nebula and/or from the star-forming region. A confident determination of the distance to the putative remnant is necessary to determine whether these sources are associated or just appear superimposed in the line of sight.","created":"2023-03-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11115v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"I2Edit: Towards Multi-turn Interactive Image Editing via Dialogue","abstract":"Although there have been considerable research efforts on controllable facial image editing, the desirable interactive setting where the users can interact with the system to adjust their requirements dynamically hasn't been well explored. This paper focuses on facial image editing via dialogue and introduces a new benchmark dataset, Multi-turn Interactive Image Editing (I2Edit), for evaluating image editing quality and interaction ability in real-world interactive facial editing scenarios. The dataset is constructed upon the CelebA-HQ dataset with images annotated with a multi-turn dialogue that corresponds to the user editing requirements. I2Edit is challenging, as it needs to 1) track the dynamically updated user requirements and edit the images accordingly, as well as 2) generate the appropriate natural language response to communicate with the user. To address these challenges, we propose a framework consisting of a dialogue module and an image editing module. The former is for user edit requirements tracking and generating the corresponding indicative responses, while the latter edits the images conditioned on the tracked user edit requirements. In contrast to previous works that simply treat multi-turn interaction as a sequence of single-turn interactions, we extract the user edit requirements from the whole dialogue history instead of the current single turn. The extracted global user edit requirements enable us to directly edit the input raw image to avoid error accumulation and attribute forgetting issues. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on the I2Edit dataset demonstrate the advantage of our proposed framework over the previous single-turn methods. We believe our new dataset could serve as a valuable resource to push forward the exploration of real-world, complex interactive image editing. Code and data will be made public.","created":"2023-03-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11108v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Evaluating Language Models for Knowledge Base Completion","abstract":"Structured knowledge bases (KBs) are a foundation of many intelligent applications, yet are notoriously incomplete. Language models (LMs) have recently been proposed for unsupervised knowledge base completion (KBC), yet, despite encouraging initial results, questions regarding their suitability remain open. Existing evaluations often fall short because they only evaluate on popular subjects, or sample already existing facts from KBs. In this work, we introduce a novel, more challenging benchmark dataset, and a methodology tailored for a realistic assessment of the KBC potential of LMs. For automated assessment, we curate a dataset called WD-KNOWN, which provides an unbiased random sample of Wikidata, containing over 3.9 million facts. In a second step, we perform a human evaluation on predictions that are not yet in the KB, as only this provides real insights into the added value over existing KBs. Our key finding is that biases in dataset conception of previous benchmarks lead to a systematic overestimate of LM performance for KBC. However, our results also reveal strong areas of LMs. We could, for example, perform a significant completion of Wikidata on the relations nativeLanguage, by a factor of ~21 (from 260k to 5.8M) at 82% precision, usedLanguage, by a factor of ~2.1 (from 2.1M to 6.6M) at 82% precision, and citizenOf by a factor of ~0.3 (from 4.2M to 5.3M) at 90% precision. Moreover, we find that LMs possess surprisingly strong generalization capabilities: even on relations where most facts were not directly observed in LM training, prediction quality can be high.","created":"2023-03-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11082v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Generative AI and the Digital Commons","abstract":"Many generative foundation models (or GFMs) are trained on publicly available data and use public infrastructure, but 1) may degrade the \"digital commons\" that they depend on, and 2) do not have processes in place to return value captured to data producers and stakeholders. Existing conceptions of data rights and protection (focusing largely on individually-owned data and associated privacy concerns) and copyright or licensing-based models offer some instructive priors, but are ill-suited for the issues that may arise from models trained on commons-based data. We outline the risks posed by GFMs and why they are relevant to the digital commons, and propose numerous governance-based solutions that include investments in standardized dataset/model disclosure and other kinds of transparency when it comes to generative models' training and capabilities, consortia-based funding for monitoring/standards/auditing organizations, requirements or norms for GFM companies to contribute high quality data to the commons, and structures for shared ownership based on individual or community provision of fine-tuning data.","created":"2023-03-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11074v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"ContraNeRF: Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Synthetic-to-real Novel View Synthesis via Contrastive Learning","abstract":"Although many recent works have investigated generalizable NeRF-based novel view synthesis for unseen scenes, they seldom consider the synthetic-to-real generalization, which is desired in many practical applications. In this work, we first investigate the effects of synthetic data in synthetic-to-real novel view synthesis and surprisingly observe that models trained with synthetic data tend to produce sharper but less accurate volume densities. For pixels where the volume densities are correct, fine-grained details will be obtained. Otherwise, severe artifacts will be produced. To maintain the advantages of using synthetic data while avoiding its negative effects, we propose to introduce geometry-aware contrastive learning to learn multi-view consistent features with geometric constraints. Meanwhile, we adopt cross-view attention to further enhance the geometry perception of features by querying features across input views. Experiments demonstrate that under the synthetic-to-real setting, our method can render images with higher quality and better fine-grained details, outperforming existing generalizable novel view synthesis methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. When trained on real data, our method also achieves state-of-the-art results.","created":"2023-03-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11052v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"From Sparse to Precise: A Practical Editing Approach for Intracardiac Echocardiography Segmentation","abstract":"Accurate and safe catheter ablation procedures for patients with atrial fibrillation require precise segmentation of cardiac structures in Intracardiac Echocardiography (ICE) imaging. Prior studies have suggested methods that employ 3D geometry information from the ICE transducer to create a sparse ICE volume by placing 2D frames in a 3D grid, enabling training of 3D segmentation models. However, the resulting 3D masks from these models can be inaccurate and may lead to serious clinical complications due to the sparse sampling in ICE data, frames misalignment, and cardiac motion. To address this issue, we propose an interactive editing framework that allows users to edit segmentation output by drawing scribbles on a 2D frame. The user interaction is mapped to the 3D grid and utilized to execute an editing step that modifies the segmentation in the vicinity of the interaction while preserving the previous segmentation away from the interaction. Furthermore, our framework accommodates multiple edits to the segmentation output in a sequential manner without compromising previous edits. This paper presents a novel loss function and a novel evaluation metric specifically designed for editing. Results from cross-validation and testing indicate that our proposed loss function outperforms standard losses and training strategies in terms of segmentation quality and following user input. Additionally, we show quantitatively and qualitatively that subsequent edits do not compromise previous edits when using our method, as opposed to standard segmentation losses. Overall, our approach enhances the accuracy of the segmentation while avoiding undesired changes away from user interactions and without compromising the quality of previously edited regions, leading to better patient outcomes.","created":"2023-03-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11041v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Self-Supervised Learning for Multimodal Non-Rigid 3D Shape Matching","abstract":"The matching of 3D shapes has been extensively studied for shapes represented as surface meshes, as well as for shapes represented as point clouds. While point clouds are a common representation of raw real-world 3D data (e.g. from laser scanners), meshes encode rich and expressive topological information, but their creation typically requires some form of (often manual) curation. In turn, methods that purely rely on point clouds are unable to meet the matching quality of mesh-based methods that utilise the additional topological structure. In this work we close this gap by introducing a self-supervised multimodal learning strategy that combines mesh-based functional map regularisation with a contrastive loss that couples mesh and point cloud data. Our shape matching approach allows to obtain intramodal correspondences for triangle meshes, complete point clouds, and partially observed point clouds, as well as correspondences across these data modalities. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several challenging benchmark datasets even in comparison to recent supervised methods, and that our method reaches previously unseen cross-dataset generalisation ability.","created":"2023-03-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10971v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"LFACon: Introducing Anglewise Attention to No-Reference Quality Assessment in Light Field Space","abstract":"Light field imaging can capture both the intensity information and the direction information of light rays. It naturally enables a six-degrees-of-freedom viewing experience and deep user engagement in virtual reality. Compared to 2D image assessment, light field image quality assessment (LFIQA) needs to consider not only the image quality in the spatial domain but also the quality consistency in the angular domain. However, there is a lack of metrics to effectively reflect the angular consistency and thus the angular quality of a light field image (LFI). Furthermore, the existing LFIQA metrics suffer from high computational costs due to the excessive data volume of LFIs. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of \"anglewise attention\" by introducing a multihead self-attention mechanism to the angular domain of an LFI. This mechanism better reflects the LFI quality. In particular, we propose three new attention kernels, including anglewise self-attention, anglewise grid attention, and anglewise central attention. These attention kernels can realize angular self-attention, extract multiangled features globally or selectively, and reduce the computational cost of feature extraction. By effectively incorporating the proposed kernels, we further propose our light field attentional convolutional neural network (LFACon) as an LFIQA metric. Our experimental results show that the proposed LFACon metric significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art LFIQA metrics. For the majority of distortion types, LFACon attains the best performance with lower complexity and less computational time.","created":"2023-03-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10961v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this study, we collected u-XRD mapping data from an LaCl3-calcite hydrothermal fluid system and trained two categories of models to solve the experimental XRD patterns. The models trained by synthetic XRD patterns show low accuracy (as low as 64%) when solving experimental u-XRD mapping data. The accuracy of the DNN models was significantly improved (90% or above) when training them with the dataset containing both synthetic and small number of labeled experimental u-XRD patterns. This study highlighted the importance of labeled experimental patterns on the training of DNN models to solve u-XRD mapping data from in-situ experiments involving liquid phase.","created":"2023-03-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10881v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Less is More: Unsupervised Mask-guided Annotated CT Image Synthesis with Minimum Manual Segmentations","abstract":"As a pragmatic data augmentation tool, data synthesis has generally returned dividends in performance for deep learning based medical image analysis. However, generating corresponding segmentation masks for synthetic medical images is laborious and subjective. To obtain paired synthetic medical images and segmentations, conditional generative models that use segmentation masks as synthesis conditions were proposed. However, these segmentation mask-conditioned generative models still relied on large, varied, and labeled training datasets, and they could only provide limited constraints on human anatomical structures, leading to unrealistic image features. Moreover, the invariant pixel-level conditions could reduce the variety of synthetic lesions and thus reduce the efficacy of data augmentation. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a novel strategy for medical image synthesis, namely Unsupervised Mask (UM)-guided synthesis, to obtain both synthetic images and segmentations using limited manual segmentation labels. We first develop a superpixel based algorithm to generate unsupervised structural guidance and then design a conditional generative model to synthesize images and annotations simultaneously from those unsupervised masks in a semi-supervised multi-task setting. In addition, we devise a multi-scale multi-task Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (MM-FID) and multi-scale multi-task standard deviation (MM-STD) to harness both fidelity and variety evaluations of synthetic CT images. With multiple analyses on different scales, we could produce stable image quality measurements with high reproducibility.

{"title":"NeRF-LOAM: Neural Implicit Representation for Large-Scale Incremental LiDAR Odometry and Mapping","abstract":"Simultaneously odometry and mapping using LiDAR data is an important task for mobile systems to achieve full autonomy in large-scale environments. However, most existing LiDAR-based methods prioritize tracking quality over reconstruction quality. Although the recently developed neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown promising advances in implicit reconstruction for indoor environments, the problem of simultaneous odometry and mapping for large-scale scenarios using incremental LiDAR data remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel NeRF-based LiDAR odometry and mapping approach, NeRF-LOAM, consisting of three modules neural odometry, neural mapping, and mesh reconstruction. All these modules utilize our proposed neural signed distance function, which separates LiDAR points into ground and non-ground points to reduce Z-axis drift, optimizes odometry and voxel embeddings concurrently, and in the end generates dense smooth mesh maps of the environment. Moreover, this joint optimization allows our NeRF-LOAM to be pre-trained free and exhibit strong generalization abilities when applied to different environments. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art odometry and mapping performance, as well as a strong generalization in large-scale environments utilizing LiDAR data. Furthermore, we perform multiple ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our network design.

Using self-supervised deep learning, we demonstrate that it is possible to distil knowledge during training from information-dense data into models which only require information-sparse data for inference. This improves downstream classification accuracy on information-sparse data, making it comparable with the fully-supervised baseline. We find substantial effects on the learned representations, and this training process identifies subtle features which otherwise go undetected.

Federated Learning (FL) has been emerging as a method for privacy-preserving pooling of datasets employing collaborative training from different institutions by iteratively globally aggregating locally trained models. One critical performance challenge of FL is operating on datasets not independently and identically distributed (non-IID) among the federation participants. Even though this fragility cannot be eliminated, it can be debunked by a suitable optimization of two hyper-parameters: layer normalization methods and collaboration frequency selection. In this work, we benchmark five different normalization layers for training Neural Networks (NNs), two families of non-IID data skew, and two datasets. Results show that Batch Normalization, widely employed for centralized DL, is not the best choice for FL, whereas Group and Layer Normalization consistently outperform Batch Normalization.

{"title":"Lightweight Contrastive Protein Structure-Sequence Transformation","abstract":"Pretrained protein structure models without labels are crucial foundations for the majority of protein downstream applications. The conventional structure pretraining methods follow the mature natural language pretraining methods such as denoised reconstruction and masked language modeling but usually destroy the real representation of spatial structures. The other common pretraining methods might predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories, where a restricted supervised manner limits their generality and usability as additional labeled data is required to specify any other protein concepts. In this work, we introduce a novel unsupervised protein structure representation pretraining with a robust protein language model. In particular, we first propose to leverage an existing pretrained language model to guide structure model learning through an unsupervised contrastive alignment. In addition, a self-supervised structure constraint is proposed to further learn the intrinsic information about the structures. With only light training data, the pretrained structure model can obtain better generalization ability. To quantitatively evaluate the proposed structure models, we design a series of rational evaluation methods, including internal tasks (e.g., contact map prediction, distribution alignment quality) and external/downstream tasks (e.g., protein design). The extensive experimental results conducted on multiple tasks and specific datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed sequence-structure transformation framework.","created":"2023-03-19","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11783v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

As the backbone of the modern economy, it offers subscription-based computing services anytime, anywhere, on a pay-as-you-go basis. Its use is growing exponentially with the continued development of new classes of applications driven by a huge number of emerging networked devices. However, the success of Cloud computing has created a new global energy challenge, as it comes at the cost of vast energy usage. Currently, data centres hosting Cloud services world-wide consume more energy than most countries. Globally, by 2025, they are projected to consume 20% of global electricity and emit up to 5.5% of the world's carbon emissions. In addition, a significant part of the energy consumed is transformed into heat which leads to operational problems, including a reduction in system reliability and the life expectancy of devices, and escalation in cooling requirements. Therefore, for future generations of Cloud computing to address the environmental and operational consequences of such significant energy usage, they must become energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable while continuing to deliver high-quality services.   In this paper, we propose a vision for learning-centric approach for the integrated management of new generation Cloud computing environments to reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprint while delivering service quality guarantees.

However, current VUDA methods rely on a vast amount of high-quality unlabeled target data, which may not be available in real-world cases. We thus consider a more realistic \\textit{Few-Shot Video-based Domain Adaptation} (FSVDA) scenario where we adapt video models with only a few target video samples. While a few methods have touched upon Few-Shot Domain Adaptation (FSDA) in images and in FSVDA, they rely primarily on spatial augmentation for target domain expansion with alignment performed statistically at the instance level. However, videos contain more knowledge in terms of rich temporal and semantic information, which should be fully considered while augmenting target domains and performing alignment in FSVDA. We propose a novel SSA2lign to address FSVDA at the snippet level, where the target domain is expanded through a simple snippet-level augmentation followed by the attentive alignment of snippets both semantically and statistically, where semantic alignment of snippets is conducted through multiple perspectives. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SSA2lign across multiple cross-domain action recognition benchmarks.","created":"2023-03-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10451v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"FD-Net: An Unsupervised Deep Forward-Distortion Model for Susceptibility Artifact Correction in EPI","abstract":"Recent learning-based correction approaches in EPI estimate a displacement field, unwarp the reversed-PE image pair with the estimated field, and average the unwarped pair to yield a corrected image. Unsupervised learning in these unwarping-based methods is commonly attained via a similarity constraint between the unwarped images in reversed-PE directions, neglecting consistency to the acquired EPI images. This work introduces an unsupervised deep-learning method for fast and effective correction of susceptibility artifacts in reversed phase-encode (PE) image pairs acquired with EPI. FD-Net predicts both the susceptibility-induced displacement field and the underlying anatomically-correct image. Unlike previous methods, FD-Net enforces the forward-distortions of the correct image in both PE directions to be consistent with the acquired reversed-PE image pair. FD-Net further leverages a multiresolution architecture to maintain high local and global performance. FD-Net performs competitively with a gold-standard reference method (TOPUP) in image quality, while enabling a leap in computational efficiency. Furthermore, FD-Net outperforms recent unwarping-based methods for unsupervised correction in terms of both image and field quality. The unsupervised FD-Net method introduces a deep forward-distortion approach to enable fast, high-fidelity correction of susceptibility artifacts in EPI by maintaining consistency to measured data. Therefore, it holds great promise for improving the anatomical accuracy of EPI imaging.","created":"2023-03-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10436v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Meanwhile, to check if our perturbation can be normalized to its clean version, we applied spell corrector algorithms on this dataset.

Most importantly, they fail in considering a key element for prognosis: not all features extracted at the current moment may contribute to the prognosis prediction several years later. To address the current drawbacks of the literature, we propose a novel hypergraph framework based on an information bottleneck strategy (HGIB). Firstly, our framework seeks to discriminate irrelevant information, and therefore, solely focus on harmonising relevant information for future MCI conversion prediction e.g., two years later). Secondly, our model simultaneously accounts for multi-modal data based on imaging and non-imaging modalities. HGIB uses a hypergraph structure to represent the multi-modality data and accounts for various data modality types. Thirdly, the key of our model is based on a new optimisation scheme. It is based on modelling the principle of information bottleneck into loss functions that can be integrated into our hypergraph neural network. We demonstrate, through extensive experiments on ADNI, that our proposed HGIB framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art hypergraph neural networks for Alzheimer's disease prognosis. We showcase our model even under fewer labels. Finally, we further support the robustness and generalisation capabilities of our framework under both topological and feature perturbations.","created":"2023-03-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10390v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"3D Data Augmentation for Driving Scenes on Camera","abstract":"Driving scenes are extremely diverse and complicated that it is impossible to collect all cases with human effort alone. While data augmentation is an effective technique to enrich the training data, existing methods for camera data in autonomous driving applications are confined to the 2D image plane, which may not optimally increase data diversity in 3D real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose a 3D data augmentation approach termed Drive-3DAug, aiming at augmenting the driving scenes on camera in the 3D space. We first utilize Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to reconstruct the 3D models of background and foreground objects. Then, augmented driving scenes can be obtained by placing the 3D objects with adapted location and orientation at the pre-defined valid region of backgrounds. As such, the training database could be effectively scaled up. However, the 3D object modeling is constrained to the image quality and the limited viewpoints. To overcome these problems, we modify the original NeRF by introducing a geometric rectified loss and a symmetric-aware training strategy. We evaluate our method for the camera-only monocular 3D detection task on the Waymo and nuScences datasets. The proposed data augmentation approach contributes to a gain of 1.7% and 1.4% in terms of detection accuracy, on Waymo and nuScences respectively. Furthermore, the constructed 3D models serve as digital driving assets and could be recycled for different detectors or other 3D perception tasks.","created":"2023-03-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10340v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Pseudo Supervised Metrics: Evaluating Unsupervised Image to Image Translation Models In Unsupervised Cross-Domain Classification Frameworks","abstract":"The ability to classify images accurately and efficiently is dependent on having access to large labeled datasets and testing on data from the same domain that the model is trained on. Classification becomes more challenging when dealing with new data from a different domain, where collecting a large labeled dataset and training a new classifier from scratch is time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes infeasible or impossible. Cross-domain classification frameworks were developed to handle this data domain shift problem by utilizing unsupervised image-to-image (UI2I) translation models to translate an input image from the unlabeled domain to the labeled domain. The problem with these unsupervised models lies in their unsupervised nature. For lack of annotations, it is not possible to use the traditional supervised metrics to evaluate these translation models to pick the best-saved checkpoint model. In this paper, we introduce a new method called Pseudo Supervised Metrics that was designed specifically to support cross-domain classification applications contrary to other typically used metrics such as the FID which was designed to evaluate the model in terms of the quality of the generated image from a human-eye perspective. We show that our metric not only outperforms unsupervised metrics such as the FID, but is also highly correlated with the true supervised metrics, robust, and explainable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it can be used as a standard metric for future research in this field by applying it to a critical real-world problem (the boiling crisis problem).","created":"2023-03-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10310v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Forecasting COVID-19 Case Counts Based on 2020 Ontario Data","abstract":"Objective: To develop machine learning models that can predict the number of COVID-19 cases per day given the last 14 days of environmental and mobility data.   Approach: COVID-19 data from four counties around Toronto, Ontario, were used. Data were prepared into daily records containing the number of new COVID case counts, patient demographic data, outdoor weather variables, indoor environment factors, and human movement based on cell mobility and public health restrictions. This data was analyzed to determine the most important variables and their interactions. Predictive models were developed using CNN and LSTM deep neural network approaches. A 5-fold chronological cross-validation approach used these methods to develop predictive models using data from Mar 1 to Oct 14 2020, and test them on data covering Oct 15 to Dec 24 2020. Results: The best LSTM models forecasted tomorrow's daily COVID case counts with 90.7% accuracy, and the 7-day rolling average COVID case counts with 98.1% accuracy using independent test data. The best models to forecast the next 7 days of daily COVID case counts did so with 79.4% accuracy over all days. Models forecasting the 7-day rolling average case counts had a mean accuracy of 83.6% on the same test set.   Conclusions: Our findings point to the importance of indoor humidity for the transmission of a virus such as COVID-19. During the coldest portions of the year, when humans spend greater amounts of time indoors or in vehicles, air quality drops within buildings, most significantly indoor relative humidity levels. Moderate to high indoor temperatures coupled with low IRH (below 20%) create conditions where viral transmission is more likely because water vapour ejected from an infected person's mouth can remain longer in the air because of evaporation and dry skin conditions, particularly in a recipient's airway, promotes transmission.","created":"2023-03-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10294v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Synthetic-to-Real Domain Adaptation for Action Recognition: A Dataset and Baseline Performances","abstract":"Human action recognition is a challenging problem, particularly when there is high variability in factors such as subject appearance, backgrounds and viewpoint. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to perform well on action recognition tasks, they typically require large amounts of high-quality labeled data to achieve robust performance across a variety of conditions. Synthetic data has shown promise as a way to avoid the substantial costs and potential ethical concerns associated with collecting and labeling enormous amounts of data in the real-world. However, synthetic data may differ from real data in important ways. This phenomenon, known as \\textit{domain shift}, can limit the utility of synthetic data in robotics applications. To mitigate the effects of domain shift, substantial effort is being dedicated to the development of domain adaptation (DA) techniques. Yet, much remains to be understood about how best to develop these techniques. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset called Robot Control Gestures (RoCoG-v2). The dataset is composed of both real and synthetic videos from seven gesture classes, and is intended to support the study of synthetic-to-real domain shift for video-based action recognition. Our work expands upon existing datasets by focusing the action classes on gestures for human-robot teaming, as well as by enabling investigation of domain shift in both ground and aerial views. We present baseline results using state-of-the-art action recognition and domain adaptation algorithms and offer initial insight on tackling the synthetic-to-real and ground-to-air domain shifts.","created":"2023-03-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10280v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"MRIS: A Multi-modal Retrieval Approach for Image Synthesis on Diverse Modalities","abstract":"Multiple imaging modalities are often used for disease diagnosis, prediction, or population-based analyses. However, not all modalities might be available due to cost, different study designs, or changes in imaging technology. If the differences between the types of imaging are small, data harmonization approaches can be used; for larger changes, direct image synthesis approaches have been explored. In this paper, we develop an approach based on multi-modal metric learning to synthesize images of diverse modalities. We use metric learning via multi-modal image retrieval, resulting in embeddings that can relate images of different modalities. Given a large image database, the learned image embeddings allow us to use k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) regression for image synthesis. Our driving medical problem is knee osteoarthritis (KOA), but our developed method is general after proper image alignment. We test our approach by synthesizing cartilage thickness maps obtained from 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images using 2D radiographs. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms direct image synthesis and that the synthesized thickness maps retain information relevant to downstream tasks such as progression prediction and Kellgren-Lawrence grading (KLG). Our results suggest that retrieval approaches can be used to obtain high-quality and meaningful image synthesis results given large image databases.","created":"2023-03-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10249v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

A vital enabler of its great success is the availability of abundant and high-quality data for building machine learning models. Recently, the role of data in AI has been significantly magnified, giving rise to the emerging concept of data-centric AI. The attention of researchers and practitioners has gradually shifted from advancing model design to enhancing the quality and quantity of the data. In this survey, we discuss the necessity of data-centric AI, followed by a holistic view of three general data-centric goals (training data development, inference data development, and data maintenance) and the representative methods. We also organize the existing literature from automation and collaboration perspectives, discuss the challenges, and tabulate the benchmarks for various tasks. We believe this is the first comprehensive survey that provides a global view of a spectrum of tasks across various stages of the data lifecycle. We hope it can help the readers efficiently grasp a broad picture of this field, and equip them with the techniques and further research ideas to systematically engineer data for building AI systems.

{"title":"Toward Super-Resolution for Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation","abstract":"Gaze tracking is a valuable tool with a broad range of applications in various fields, including medicine, psychology, virtual reality, marketing, and safety. Therefore, it is essential to have gaze tracking software that is cost-efficient and high-performing. Accurately predicting gaze remains a difficult task, particularly in real-world situations where images are affected by motion blur, video compression, and noise. Super-resolution has been shown to improve image quality from a visual perspective. This work examines the usefulness of super-resolution for improving appearance-based gaze tracking. We show that not all SR models preserve the gaze direction. We propose a two-step framework based on SwinIR super-resolution model. The proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, particularly in scenarios involving low-resolution or degraded images. Furthermore, we examine the use of super-resolution through the lens of self-supervised learning for gaze prediction. Self-supervised learning aims to learn from unlabelled data to reduce the amount of required labeled data for downstream tasks. We propose a novel architecture called SuperVision by fusing an SR backbone network to a ResNet18 (with some skip connections). The proposed SuperVision method uses 5x less labeled data and yet outperforms, by 15%, the state-of-the-art method of GazeTR which uses 100% of training data.","created":"2023-03-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10151v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Efficient Neural Generation of 4K Masks for Homogeneous Diffusion Inpainting","abstract":"With well-selected data, homogeneous diffusion inpainting can reconstruct images from sparse data with high quality. While 4K colour images of size 3840 x 2160 can already be inpainted in real time, optimising the known data for applications like image compression remains challenging: Widely used stochastic strategies can take days for a single 4K image. Recently, a first neural approach for this so-called mask optimisation problem offered high speed and good quality for small images. It trains a mask generation network with the help of a neural inpainting surrogate. However, these mask networks can only output masks for the resolution and mask density they were trained for. We solve these problems and enable mask optimisation for high-resolution images through a neuroexplicit coarse-to-fine strategy. Additionally, we improve the training and interpretability of mask networks by including a numerical inpainting solver directly into the network. This allows to generate masks for 4K images in around 0.6 seconds while exceeding the quality of stochastic methods on practically relevant densities. Compared to popular existing approaches, this is an acceleration of up to four orders of magnitude.","created":"2023-03-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10096v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

The sample consists of 13096 galaxies at redshifts z < 0.08 with imaging data from the Kilo-Degree Survey and the VISTA Kilo-Degree INfrared Galaxy survey spanning the optical and near-infrared. We fit three models to the surface brightness distribution of each galaxy in each band: a single S\\'ersic model, a S\\'ersic plus exponential and a point source plus exponential. The fitting is performed with a fully automated Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using the Bayesian two-dimensional profile fitting code ProFit. All preparatory work is carried out using the image analysis package ProFound. After fitting the galaxies, we perform model selection and flag galaxies for which none of our models are appropriate, mainly mergers and irregular galaxies. The fit quality is assessed by visual inspections, comparison to previous works, comparison of independent fits of galaxies in the overlap regions between KiDS tiles and bespoke simulations. The latter two are also used for a detailed investigation of systematic error sources. We find that our fit results are robust across various galaxy types and image qualities with minimal biases. Errors given by the MCMC underestimate the true errors typically by factors 2-3. Automated model selection criteria are accurate to > 90 % as calibrated by visual inspection of a subsample of galaxies. We also present g-r component colours and the corresponding colour-magnitude diagram, consistent with previous works despite our increased fit flexibility.

Low signal-to-noise ratios, movement of molecules out-of-focus, and high motion blur on images recorded with scanning two-photon microscopy (2PM) in vivo pose a challenge to the accurate localisation of molecules. Using data-driven models is challenging due to low data volumes, typical for in vivo experiments. We developed a 2PM image simulator to supplement scarce training data. The simulator mimics realistic motion blur, background fluorescence, and shot noise observed in vivo imaging. Training a data-driven model with simulated data improves localisation quality in simulated images and shows why intensity-based methods fail.","created":"2023-03-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16903v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Geometry-Aware Latent Representation Learning for Modeling Disease Progression of Barrett's Esophagus","abstract":"Barrett's Esophagus (BE) is the only precursor known to Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (EAC), a type of esophageal cancer with poor prognosis upon diagnosis. Therefore, diagnosing BE is crucial in preventing and treating esophageal cancer. While supervised machine learning supports BE diagnosis, high interobserver variability in histopathological training data limits these methods. Unsupervised representation learning via Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) shows promise, as they map input data to a lower-dimensional manifold with only useful features, characterizing BE progression for improved downstream tasks and insights. However, the VAE's Euclidean latent space distorts point relationships, hindering disease progression modeling. Geometric VAEs provide additional geometric structure to the latent space, with RHVAE assuming a Riemannian manifold and $\\mathcal{S}$-VAE a hyperspherical manifold. Our study shows that $\\mathcal{S}$-VAE outperforms vanilla VAE with better reconstruction losses, representation classification accuracies, and higher-quality generated images and interpolations in lower-dimensional settings. By disentangling rotation information from the latent space, we improve results further using a group-based architecture. Additionally, we take initial steps towards $\\mathcal{S}$-AE, a novel autoencoder model generating qualitative images without a variational framework, but retaining benefits of autoencoders such as stability and reconstruction quality.","created":"2023-03-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12711v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"A Benchmark of PDF Information Extraction Tools using a Multi-Task and Multi-Domain Evaluation Framework for Academic Documents","abstract":"Extracting information from academic PDF documents is crucial for numerous indexing, retrieval, and analysis use cases. Choosing the best tool to extract specific content elements is difficult because many, technically diverse tools are available, but recent performance benchmarks are rare. Moreover, such benchmarks typically cover only a few content elements like header metadata or bibliographic references and use smaller datasets from specific academic disciplines. We provide a large and diverse evaluation framework that supports more extraction tasks than most related datasets. Our framework builds upon DocBank, a multi-domain dataset of 1.5M annotated content elements extracted from 500K pages of research papers on arXiv. Using the new framework, we benchmark ten freely available tools in extracting document metadata, bibliographic references, tables, and other content elements from academic PDF documents. GROBID achieves the best metadata and reference extraction results, followed by CERMINE and Science Parse. For table extraction, Adobe Extract outperforms other tools, even though the performance is much lower than for other content elements. All tools struggle to extract lists, footers, and equations. We conclude that more research on improving and combining tools is necessary to achieve satisfactory extraction quality for most content elements. Evaluation datasets and frameworks like the one we present support this line of research.

{"title":"Robust Semi-Supervised Learning for Histopathology Images through Self-Supervision Guided Out-of-Distribution Scoring","abstract":"Semi-supervised learning (semi-SL) is a promising alternative to supervised learning for medical image analysis when obtaining good quality supervision for medical imaging is difficult. However, semi-SL assumes that the underlying distribution of unaudited data matches that of the few labeled samples, which is often violated in practical settings, particularly in medical images. The presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in the unlabeled training pool of semi-SL is inevitable and can reduce the efficiency of the algorithm. Common preprocessing methods to filter out outlier samples may not be suitable for medical images that involve a wide range of anatomical structures and rare morphologies. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline for addressing open-set supervised learning challenges in digital histology images. Our pipeline efficiently estimates an OOD score for each unlabelled data point based on self-supervised learning to calibrate the knowledge needed for a subsequent semi-SL framework. The outlier score derived from the OOD detector is used to modulate sample selection for the subsequent semi-SL stage, ensuring that samples conforming to the distribution of the few labeled samples are more frequently exposed to the subsequent semi-SL framework. Our framework is compatible with any semi-SL framework, and we base our experiments on the popular Mixmatch semi-SL framework. We conduct extensive studies on two digital pathology datasets, Kather colorectal histology dataset and a dataset derived from TCGA-BRCA whole slide images, and establish the effectiveness of our method by comparing with popular methods and frameworks in semi-SL algorithms through various experiments.","created":"2023-03-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09930v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this work, we aim to introduce the first highly non-trivial dimensionality reduction performance metric. This metric is based on the sectional curvature behaviour arising from Riemannian geometry. To test its feasibility, this metric has been used to evaluate the performance of the most commonly used dimension reduction algorithms in the state of the art. Furthermore, to make the evaluation of the algorithms robust and representative, using curvature properties of planar curves, a new parameterized problem instance generator has been constructed in the form of a function generator. Experimental results are consistent with what could be expected based on the design and characteristics of the evaluated algorithms and the features of the data instances used to feed the method.","created":"2023-03-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09909v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this paper, a total of 638,000 `Unknown' spectra from LAMOST DR5 are selected, and an unsupervised-based analytical framework of `Unknown' spectra named SA-Frame (Spectra Analysis-Frame) is provided to explore their origins from different perspectives. The SA-Frame is composed of three parts: NAPC-Spec clustering, characterization and origin analysis. First, NAPC-Spec(Nonparametric density clustering algorithm for spectra) characterizes different features in the \"unknown\" spectrum by adjusting the influence space and divergence distance to minimize the effects of noise and high dimensionality, resulting in 13 types. Second, characteristic extraction and representation of clustering results are carried out based on spectral lines and continuum, where these 13 types are characterized as regular spectra with low S/Ns, splicing problems, suspected galactic emission signals, contamination from city light and un-gregarious type respectively. Third, a preliminary analysis of their origins is made from the characteristics of the observational targets, contamination from the sky, and the working status of the instruments.

A rich-content Real Animation Low-quality (RAL) video dataset is collected for extracting the priors.

The proposed strategy is valid to lift the upper bound of animation VSR performance, regardless of the specific VSR model.

Our experimental findings on both public and in-house datasets show that our model is more reliable than current methods.

This paper proposes a general GSL framework, SE-GSL, through structural entropy and the graph hierarchy abstracted in the encoding tree. Particularly, we exploit the one-dimensional structural entropy to maximize embedded information content when auxiliary neighbourhood attributes are fused to enhance the original graph. A new scheme of constructing optimal encoding trees is proposed to minimize the uncertainty and noises in the graph whilst assuring proper community partition in hierarchical abstraction. We present a novel sample-based mechanism for restoring the graph structure via node structural entropy distribution. It increases the connectivity among nodes with larger uncertainty in lower-level communities. SE-GSL is compatible with various GNN models and enhances the robustness towards noisy and heterophily structures.

{"title":"Rapid Sensing of Hidden Objects and Defects using a Single-Pixel Diffractive Terahertz Processor","abstract":"Terahertz waves offer numerous advantages for the nondestructive detection of hidden objects/defects in materials, as they can penetrate through most optically-opaque materials. However, existing terahertz inspection systems are restricted in their throughput and accuracy (especially for detecting small features) due to their limited speed and resolution. Furthermore, machine vision-based continuous sensing systems that use large-pixel-count imaging are generally bottlenecked due to their digital storage, data transmission and image processing requirements. Here, we report a diffractive processor that rapidly detects hidden defects/objects within a target sample using a single-pixel spectroscopic terahertz detector, without scanning the sample or forming/processing its image. This terahertz processor consists of passive diffractive layers that are optimized using deep learning to modify the spectrum of the terahertz radiation according to the absence/presence of hidden structures or defects. After its fabrication, the resulting diffractive processor all-optically probes the structural information of the sample volume and outputs a spectrum that directly indicates the presence or absence of hidden structures, not visible from outside. As a proof-of-concept, we trained a diffractive terahertz processor to sense hidden defects (including subwavelength features) inside test samples, and evaluated its performance by analyzing the detection sensitivity as a function of the size and position of the unknown defects. We validated its feasibility using a single-pixel terahertz time-domain spectroscopy setup and 3D-printed diffractive layers, successfully detecting hidden defects using pulsed terahertz illumination. This technique will be valuable for various applications, e.g., security screening, biomedical sensing, quality control, anti-counterfeiting measures and cultural heritage protection.","created":"2023-03-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09764v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Learning towards Selective Data Augmentation for Dialogue Generation","abstract":"As it is cumbersome and expensive to acquire a huge amount of data for training neural dialog models, data augmentation is proposed to effectively utilize existing training samples. However, current data augmentation techniques on the dialog generation task mostly augment all cases in the training dataset without considering the intrinsic attributes between different cases. We argue that not all cases are beneficial for augmentation task, and the cases suitable for augmentation should obey the following two attributes: (1) low-quality (the dialog model cannot generate a high-quality response for the case), (2) representative (the case should represent the property of the whole dataset). Herein, we explore this idea by proposing a Selective Data Augmentation framework (SDA) for the response generation task. SDA employs a dual adversarial network to select the lowest quality and most representative data points for augmentation in one stage. Extensive experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets, i.e., DailyDialog and OpenSubtitles, show that our framework can improve the response generation performance with respect to various metrics.","created":"2023-03-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09719v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Designated as Gaia Nearby Accelerating Star Catalog (GNASC), it contains 29,684 members identified using a supervised machine-learning algorithm trained on the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations (HGCA), Gaia Data Release 2, and Gaia Early Data Release 3. We take advantage of the difference in observation timelines of the two Gaia catalogs and information about the quality of the astrometric modeling based on the premise that acceleration will correlate with astrometric uncertainties. Catalog membership is based on whether constant proper motion over three decades can be ruled out at high confidence (greater than 99.9%). Test data suggest that catalog members each have a 68% likelihood of true astrometric acceleration; subsets of the catalog perform even better, with the likelihood exceeding 85%. We compare the GNASC with Gaia Data Release 3 and its table of stars for which acceleration is detected at high confidence based on precise astrometric fits. Our catalog, derived without this information, captured over 96% of sources in the table that meet our selection criteria.

It thus extends the HGCA and demonstrates the potential of the machine-learning approach to discover hidden partners of nearby stars in future astrometric surveys.","created":"2023-03-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09712v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Mobiprox: Supporting Dynamic Approximate Computing on Mobiles","abstract":"Runtime-tunable context-dependent network compression would make mobile deep learning adaptable to often varying resource availability, input \"difficulty\", or user needs. The existing compression techniques significantly reduce the memory, processing, and energy tax of deep learning, yet, the resulting models tend to be permanently impaired, sacrificing the inference power for reduced resource usage. The existing tunable compression approaches, on the other hand, require expensive re-training, seldom provide mobile-ready implementations, and do not support arbitrary strategies for adapting the compression.   In this paper we present Mobiprox, a framework enabling flexible-accuracy on-device deep learning. Mobiprox implements tunable approximations of tensor operations and enables runtime adaptation of individual network layers. A profiler and a tuner included with Mobiprox identify the most promising neural network approximation configurations leading to the desired inference quality with the minimal use of resources. Furthermore, we develop control strategies that depending on contextual factors, such as the input data difficulty, dynamically adjust the approximation level of a model. We implement Mobiprox in Android OS and through experiments in diverse mobile domains, including human activity recognition and spoken keyword detection, demonstrate that it can save up to 15% system-wide energy with a minimal impact on the inference accuracy.","created":"2023-03-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11291v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"From MNIST to ImageNet and Back: Benchmarking Continual Curriculum Learning","abstract":"Continual learning (CL) is one of the most promising trends in recent machine learning research. Its goal is to go beyond classical assumptions in machine learning and develop models and learning strategies that present high robustness in dynamic environments. The landscape of CL research is fragmented into several learning evaluation protocols, comprising different learning tasks, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, the benchmarks adopted so far are still distant from the complexity of real-world scenarios, and are usually tailored to highlight capabilities specific to certain strategies. In such a landscape, it is hard to objectively assess strategies. In this work, we fill this gap for CL on image data by introducing two novel CL benchmarks that involve multiple heterogeneous tasks from six image datasets, with varying levels of complexity and quality. Our aim is to fairly evaluate current state-of-the-art CL strategies on a common ground that is closer to complex real-world scenarios. We additionally structure our benchmarks so that tasks are presented in increasing and decreasing order of complexity -- according to a curriculum -- in order to evaluate if current CL models are able to exploit structure across tasks. We devote particular emphasis to providing the CL community with a rigorous and reproducible evaluation protocol for measuring the ability of a model to generalize and not to forget while learning. Furthermore, we provide an extensive experimental evaluation showing that popular CL strategies, when challenged with our benchmarks, yield sub-par performance, high levels of forgetting, and present a limited ability to effectively leverage curriculum task ordering. We believe that these results highlight the need for rigorous comparisons in future CL works as well as pave the way to design new CL strategies that are able to deal with more complex scenarios.","created":"2023-03-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11076v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Towards the Scalable Evaluation of Cooperativeness in Language Models","abstract":"It is likely that AI systems driven by pre-trained language models (PLMs) will increasingly be used to assist humans in high-stakes interactions with other agents, such as negotiation or conflict resolution. Consistent with the goals of Cooperative AI \\citep{dafoe_open_2020}, we wish to understand and shape the multi-agent behaviors of PLMs in a pro-social manner. An important first step is the evaluation of model behaviour across diverse cooperation problems. Since desired behaviour in an interaction depends upon precise game-theoretic structure, we focus on generating scenarios with particular structures with both crowdworkers and a language model. Our work proceeds as follows. First, we discuss key methodological issues in the generation of scenarios corresponding to particular game-theoretic structures. Second, we employ both crowdworkers and a language model to generate such scenarios. We find that the quality of generations tends to be mediocre in both cases. We additionally get both crowdworkers and a language model to judge whether given scenarios align with their intended game-theoretic structure, finding mixed results depending on the game. Third, we provide a dataset of scenario based on our data generated. We provide both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of UnifiedQA and GPT-3 on this dataset. We find that instruct-tuned models tend to act in a way that could be perceived as cooperative when scaled up, while other models seemed to have flat scaling trends.","created":"2023-03-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13360v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"CSSL-MHTR: Continual Self-Supervised Learning for Scalable Multi-script Handwritten Text Recognition","abstract":"Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a strong alternative in document analysis. These approaches are now capable of learning high-quality image representations and overcoming the limitations of supervised methods, which require a large amount of labeled data. However, these methods are unable to capture new knowledge in an incremental fashion, where data is presented to the model sequentially, which is closer to the realistic scenario. In this paper, we explore the potential of continual self-supervised learning to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem in handwritten text recognition, as an example of sequence recognition. Our method consists in adding intermediate layers called adapters for each task, and efficiently distilling knowledge from the previous model while learning the current task. Our proposed framework is efficient in both computation and memory complexity. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate our method by transferring the learned model to diverse text recognition downstream tasks, including Latin and non-Latin scripts. As far as we know, this is the first application of continual self-supervised learning for handwritten text recognition. We attain state-of-the-art performance on English, Italian and Russian scripts, whilst adding only a few parameters per task.

{"title":"Improving Automated Hemorrhage Detection in Sparse-view Computed Tomography via Deep Convolutional Neural Network based Artifact Reduction","abstract":"Intracranial hemorrhage poses a serious health problem requiring rapid and often intensive medical treatment. For diagnosis, a Cranial Computed Tomography (CCT) scan is usually performed. However, the increased health risk caused by radiation is a concern. The most important strategy to reduce this potential risk is to keep the radiation dose as low as possible and consistent with the diagnostic task. Sparse-view CT can be an effective strategy to reduce dose by reducing the total number of views acquired, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we use a U-Net architecture to reduce artifacts from sparse-view CCTs, predicting fully sampled reconstructions from sparse-view ones. We evaluate the hemorrhage detectability in the predicted CCTs with a hemorrhage classification convolutional neural network, trained on fully sampled CCTs to detect and classify different sub-types of hemorrhages. Our results suggest that the automated classification and detection accuracy of hemorrhages in sparse-view CCTs can be improved substantially by the U-Net. This demonstrates the feasibility of rapid automated hemorrhage detection on low-dose CT data to assist radiologists in routine clinical practice.","created":"2023-03-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09340v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Turn the Rudder: A Beacon of Reentrancy Detection for Smart Contracts on Ethereum","abstract":"Smart contracts are programs deployed on a blockchain and are immutable once deployed. Reentrancy, one of the most important vulnerabilities in smart contracts, has caused millions of dollars in financial loss. Many reentrancy detection approaches have been proposed. It is necessary to investigate the performance of these approaches to provide useful guidelines for their application. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on the capability of five well-known or recent reentrancy detection tools such as Mythril and Sailfish. We collect 230,548 verified smart contracts from Etherscan and use detection tools to analyze 139,424 contracts after deduplication, which results in 21,212 contracts with reentrancy issues. Then, we manually examine the defective functions located by the tools in the contracts. From the examination results, we obtain 34 true positive contracts with reentrancy and 21,178 false positive contracts without reentrancy. We also analyze the causes of the true and false positives. Finally, we evaluate the tools based on the two kinds of contracts. The results show that more than 99.8% of the reentrant contracts detected by the tools are false positives with eight types of causes, and the tools can only detect the reentrancy issues caused by call.value(), 58.8% of which can be revealed by the Ethereum's official IDE, Remix. Furthermore, we collect real-world reentrancy attacks reported in the past two years and find that the tools fail to find any issues in the corresponding contracts. Based on the findings, existing works on reentrancy detection appear to have very limited capability, and researchers should turn the rudder to discover and detect new reentrancy patterns except those related to call.value().","created":"2023-03-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13770v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this paper, we propose a Bayesian graphical approach for entity resolution that links records to latent entities, where the prior representation on the linkage structure is exchangeable. First, we adopt a flexible and tractable set of priors for the linkage structure, which corresponds to a special class of random partition models. Second, we propose a more realistic distortion model for categorical/discrete record attributes, which corrects a logical inconsistency with the standard hit-miss model. Third, we incorporate hyperpriors to improve flexibility. Fourth, we employ a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler for inferential speedups. Using a selection of private and nonprivate data sets, we investigate the impact of our modeling contributions and compare our model with two alternative Bayesian models. In addition, we conduct a simulation study for household survey data, where we vary distortion, duplication rates and data set size.

{"title":"Extending Source Code Pre-Trained Language Models to Summarise Decompiled Binaries","abstract":"Reverse engineering binaries is required to understand and analyse programs for which the source code is unavailable. Decompilers can transform the largely unreadable binaries into a more readable source code-like representation. However, reverse engineering is time-consuming, much of which is taken up by labelling the functions with semantic information.   While the automated summarisation of decompiled code can help Reverse Engineers understand and analyse binaries, current work mainly focuses on summarising source code, and no suitable dataset exists for this task.   In this work, we extend large pre-trained language models of source code to summarise decompiled binary functions. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of input and data properties on the performance of such models. Our approach consists of two main components; the data and the model.   We first build CAPYBARA, a dataset of 214K decompiled function-documentation pairs across various compiler optimisations. We extend CAPYBARA further by generating synthetic datasets and deduplicating the data.   Next, we fine-tune the CodeT5 base model with CAPYBARA to create BinT5. BinT5 achieves the state-of-the-art BLEU-4 score of 60.83, 58.82, and 44.21 for summarising source, decompiled, and synthetically stripped decompiled code, respectively. This indicates that these models can be extended to decompiled binaries successfully.   Finally, we found that the performance of BinT5 is not heavily dependent on the dataset size and compiler optimisation level. We recommend future research to further investigate transferring knowledge when working with less expressive input formats such as stripped binaries.","created":"2023-01-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01701v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Polarization aberrations in next-generation giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs) I. Effect on the coronagraphic performance","abstract":"Next-generation large segmented mirror telescopes are expected to perform direct imaging and characterization of Earth-like rocky planets, which requires contrast limits of $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-8}$ at wavelengths from I to J band. One critical aspect affecting the raw on-sky contrast are polarization aberrations arising from the reflection from the telescope's mirror surfaces and instrument optics. We simulate the polarization aberrations and estimate their effect on the achievable contrast for three next-generation ground-based large segmented mirror telescopes. We performed ray-tracing in Zemax and computed the polarization aberrations and Jones pupil maps using the polarization ray-tracing algorithm. The impact of these aberrations on the contrast is estimated by propagating the Jones pupil maps through a set of idealized coronagraphs using hcipy, a physical optics-based simulation framework. The optical modeling of the giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs) shows that polarization aberrations create significant leakage through a coronagraphic system. The dominant aberration is retardance defocus, which originates from the steep angles on the primary and secondary mirrors. The retardance defocus limits the contrast to $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-4}$ at 1 $\\lambda/D$ at visible wavelengths, and $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-6}$ at infrared wavelengths. The simulations also show that the coating plays a major role in determining the strength of the aberrations. Polarization aberrations will need to be considered during the design of high-contrast imaging instruments for the next generation of extremely large telescopes. This can be achieved either through compensation optics, robust coronagraphs, specialized coatings, calibration, and data analysis approaches or by incorporating polarimetry with high-contrast imaging to measure these effects.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02079v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In recent years, many companies have launched products with ECG monitoring and irregular heartbeat alert. Among all classification algorithms, the time series-based algorithm dynamic time warping (DTW) is widely adopted to undertake the ECG classification task. Though progress has been achieved, the DTW-based ECG classification also brings a new attacking vector of leaking the patients' diagnosis results. This paper shows that the ECG input samples' labels can be stolen via a side-channel attack, Flush+Reload. In particular, we first identify the vulnerability of DTW for ECG classification, i.e., the correlation between warping path choice and prediction results. Then we implement an attack that leverages Flush+Reload to monitor the warping path selection with known ECG data and then build a predictor for constructing the relation between warping path selection and labels of input ECG samples.

{"title":"Privacy-Preserving Federated Discovery of DNA Motifs with Differential Privacy","abstract":"DNA motif discovery is an important issue in gene research, which aims to identify transcription factor binding sites (i.e., motifs) in DNA sequences to reveal the mechanisms that regulate gene expression. However, the phenomenon of data silos and the problem of privacy leakage have seriously hindered the development of DNA motif discovery. On the one hand, the phenomenon of data silos makes data collection difficult. On the other hand, the collection and use of DNA data become complicated and difficult because DNA is sensitive private information. In this context, how discovering DNA motifs under the premise of ensuring privacy and security and alleviating data silos has become a very important issue. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method, namely DP-FLMD, to address this problem. Note that this is the first application of federated learning to the field of genetics research. The federated learning technique is used to solve the problem of data silos. It has the advantage of enabling multiple participants to train models together and providing privacy protection services. To address the challenges of federated learning in terms of communication costs, this paper applies a sampling method and a strategy for reducing communication costs to DP-FLMD. In addition, differential privacy, a privacy protection technique with rigorous mathematical proof, is also applied to DP-FLMD. Experiments on the DNA datasets show that DP-FLMD has high mining accuracy and runtime efficiency, and the performance of the algorithm is affected by some parameters.","created":"2023-04-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01689v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

A promising technique for this still-open problem is to train models on the encoded data. Our approach, called Privately Encoded Open Datasets with Public Labels (PEOPL), uses a certain class of randomly constructed transforms to encode sensitive data. Organizations publish their randomly encoded data and associated raw labels for ML training, where training is done without knowledge of the encoding realization. We investigate several important aspects of this problem: We introduce information-theoretic scores for privacy and utility, which quantify the average performance of an unfaithful user (e.g., adversary) and a faithful user (e.g., model developer) that have access to the published encoded data. We then theoretically characterize primitives in building families of encoding schemes that motivate the use of random deep neural networks. Empirically, we compare the performance of our randomized encoding scheme and a linear scheme to a suite of computational attacks, and we also show that our scheme achieves competitive prediction accuracy to raw-sample baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate that multiple institutions, using independent random encoders, can collaborate to train improved ML models.","created":"2023-03-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00047v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"EMShepherd: Detecting Adversarial Samples via Side-channel Leakage","abstract":"Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations-small changes crafted deliberately on the input to mislead the model for wrong predictions. Adversarial attacks have disastrous consequences for deep learning-empowered critical applications. Existing defense and detection techniques both require extensive knowledge of the model, testing inputs, and even execution details. They are not viable for general deep learning implementations where the model internal is unknown, a common 'black-box' scenario for model users. Inspired by the fact that electromagnetic (EM) emanations of a model inference are dependent on both operations and data and may contain footprints of different input classes, we propose a framework, EMShepherd, to capture EM traces of model execution, perform processing on traces and exploit them for adversarial detection. Only benign samples and their EM traces are used to train the adversarial detector: a set of EM classifiers and class-specific unsupervised anomaly detectors. When the victim model system is under attack by an adversarial example, the model execution will be different from executions for the known classes, and the EM trace will be different. We demonstrate that our air-gapped EMShepherd can effectively detect different adversarial attacks on a commonly used FPGA deep learning accelerator for both Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. It achieves a 100% detection rate on most types of adversarial samples, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art 'white-box' software-based detectors.","created":"2023-03-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15571v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

This is done through increasing the size of an injected fully-connected (FC) layer. However, this results in a resource overhead which grows larger with an increasing number of clients. We show that this resource overhead is caused by an incorrect perspective in all prior work that treats an attack on an aggregate update in the same way as an individual update with a larger batch size. Instead, by attacking the update from the perspective that aggregation is combining multiple individual updates, this allows the application of sparsity to alleviate resource overhead. We show that the use of sparsity can decrease the model size overhead by over 327$\\times$ and the computation time by 3.34$\\times$ compared to SOTA while maintaining equivalent total leakage rate, 77% even with $1000$ clients in aggregation.","created":"2023-03-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14868v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Federated Learning for Metaverse: A Survey","abstract":"The metaverse, which is at the stage of innovation and exploration, faces the dilemma of data collection and the problem of private data leakage in the process of development. This can seriously hinder the widespread deployment of the metaverse. Fortunately, federated learning (FL) is a solution to the above problems. FL is a distributed machine learning paradigm with privacy-preserving features designed for a large number of edge devices. Federated learning for metaverse (FL4M) will be a powerful tool. Because FL allows edge devices to participate in training tasks locally using their own data, computational power, and model-building capabilities. Applying FL to the metaverse not only protects the data privacy of participants but also reduces the need for high computing power and high memory on servers. Until now, there have been many studies about FL and the metaverse, respectively. In this paper, we review some of the early advances of FL4M, which will be a research direction with unlimited development potential. We first introduce the concepts of metaverse and FL, respectively. Besides, we discuss the convergence of key metaverse technologies and FL in detail, such as big data, communication technology, the Internet of Things, edge computing, blockchain, and extended reality. Finally, we discuss some key challenges and promising directions of FL4M in detail. In summary, we hope that our up-to-date brief survey can help people better understand FL4M and build a fair, open, and secure metaverse.","created":"2023-03-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17987v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Online search is more likely to lead students to validate true news than to refute false ones","abstract":"With the spread of high-speed Internet and portable smart devices, the way people access and consume information has drastically changed. However, this presents many challenges, including information overload, personal data leakage, and misinformation diffusion. Across the spectrum of risks that Internet users can face nowadays, this work focuses on understanding how young people perceive and deal with false information. Within an experimental campaign involving 261 students, we presented to the participants six different news items and invited them to browse the Internet to assess the veracity of the presented information. Our results suggest that online search is more likely to lead students to validate true news than to refute false ones. We found that students change their opinion related to a specific piece of information more often than their global idea about a broader topic. Also, our experiment reflected that the majority of participants rely on online sources to obtain information and access the news, and those getting information from books and Internet browsing are the most accurate in assessing the veracity of a news item. This work provides a principled understanding of how young people perceive and distinguish true and false pieces of information, identifying strengths and weaknesses amidst young subjects and contributing to build tailored digital information literacy strategies for youth.","created":"2023-03-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13138v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"When Evolutionary Computation Meets Privacy","abstract":"Recently, evolutionary computation (EC) has been promoted by machine learning, distributed computing, and big data technologies, resulting in new research directions of EC like distributed EC and surrogate-assisted EC. These advances have significantly improved the performance and the application scope of EC, but also trigger privacy leakages, such as the leakage of optimal results and surrogate model. Accordingly, evolutionary computation combined with privacy protection is becoming an emerging topic. However, privacy concerns in evolutionary computation lack a systematic exploration, especially for the object, motivation, position, and method of privacy protection. To this end, in this paper, we discuss three typical optimization paradigms (i.e., \\textit{centralized optimization, distributed optimization, and data-driven optimization}) to characterize optimization modes of evolutionary computation and propose BOOM to sort out privacy concerns in evolutionary computation. Specifically, the centralized optimization paradigm allows clients to outsource optimization problems to the centralized server and obtain optimization solutions from the server. While the distributed optimization paradigm exploits the storage and computational power of distributed devices to solve optimization problems. Also, the data-driven optimization paradigm utilizes data collected in history to tackle optimization problems lacking explicit objective functions. Particularly, this paper adopts BOOM to characterize the object and motivation of privacy protection in three typical optimization paradigms and discusses potential privacy-preserving technologies balancing optimization performance and privacy guarantees in three typical optimization paradigms. Furthermore, this paper attempts to foresee some new research directions of privacy-preserving evolutionary computation.","created":"2023-03-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01205v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Do the CMB Temperature Fluctuations Conserve Parity?","abstract":"Observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) have cemented the notion that the large-scale Universe is both statistically homogeneous and isotropic. But is it invariant also under mirror reflections? To probe this we require parity-sensitive statistics: for scalar observables, the simplest is the four-point function. We make the first measurements of the parity-odd CMB trispectrum, focusing on the large-scale ($2<\\ell<510$) temperature anisotropies measured by Planck. This is facilitated by new maximum-likelihood estimators for binned correlators, which account for mask convolution and leakage between even- and odd-parity components, and achieve optimal variances within $\\approx 20\\%$. We perform a blind test for parity violation by comparing a $\\chi^2$ statistic from Planck to theoretical expectations, using two suites of simulations to account for the possible likelihood non-Gaussianity and residual foregrounds. We find consistency at the $\\approx 0.5\\sigma$ level, yielding no evidence for parity violation, with roughly $250\\times$ the squared sensitivity of large scale structure measurements (according to mode-counting arguments), and with the advantage of linear physics, Gaussian statistics, and accurate mocks. The measured trispectra can be used to constrain physical models of inflationary parity violation, including Ghost Inflation, Cosmological Collider scenarios, and Chern-Simons gauge fields. Considering eight such models, we find no evidence for new physics, with a maximal detection significance of $2.0\\sigma$. These results suggest that the recent parity excesses seen in the BOSS galaxy survey are not primordial in origin. Tighter constraints can be wrought by including smaller scales (though rotational invariance washes out the flat-sky limit) and adding polarization data.","created":"2023-03-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12106v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"End-to-End Integration of Speech Separation and Voice Activity Detection for Low-Latency Diarization of Telephone Conversations","abstract":"Recent works show that speech separation guided diarization (SSGD) is an increasingly promising direction, mainly thanks to the recent progress in speech separation. It performs diarization by first separating the speakers and then applying voice activity detection (VAD) on each separated stream. In this work we conduct an in-depth study of SSGD in the conversational telephone speech (CTS) domain, focusing mainly on low-latency streaming diarization applications. We consider three state-of-the-art speech separation (SSep) algorithms and study their performance both in online and offline scenarios, considering non-causal and causal implementations as well as continuous SSep (CSS) windowed inference. We compare different SSGD algorithms on two widely used CTS datasets: CALLHOME and Fisher Corpus (Part 1 and 2) and evaluate both separation and diarization performance. To improve performance, a novel, causal and computationally efficient leakage removal algorithm is proposed, which significantly decreases false alarms. We also explore, for the first time, fully end-to-end SSGD integration between SSep and VAD modules. Crucially, this enables fine-tuning on real-world data for which oracle speakers sources are not available. In particular, our best model achieves 8.8% DER on CALLHOME, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art end-to-end neural diarization model, despite being trained on an order of magnitude less data and having significantly lower latency, i.e., 0.1 vs. 1 seconds. Finally, we also show that the separated signals can be readily used also for automatic speech recognition, reaching performance close to using oracle sources in some configurations.","created":"2023-03-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12002v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Efficient and Secure Federated Learning for Financial Applications","abstract":"The conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning approaches need to share customers' sensitive information with an external credit bureau to generate a prediction model that opens the door to privacy leakage. This leakage risk makes financial companies face an enormous challenge in their cooperation. Federated learning is a machine learning setting that can protect data privacy, but the high communication cost is often the bottleneck of the federated systems, especially for large neural networks. Limiting the number and size of communications is necessary for the practical training of large neural structures. Gradient sparsification has received increasing attention as a method to reduce communication cost, which only updates significant gradients and accumulates insignificant gradients locally. However, the secure aggregation framework cannot directly use gradient sparsification. This article proposes two sparsification methods to reduce communication cost in federated learning. One is a time-varying hierarchical sparsification method for model parameter update, which solves the problem of maintaining model accuracy after high ratio sparsity. It can significantly reduce the cost of a single communication. The other is to apply the sparsification method to the secure aggregation framework. We sparse the encryption mask matrix to reduce the cost of communication while protecting privacy. Experiments show that under different Non-IID experiment settings, our method can reduce the upload communication cost to about 2.9% to 18.9% of the conventional federated learning algorithm when the sparse rate is 0.01.","created":"2023-03-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08355v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Inferential Privacy: From Impossibility to Database Privacy","abstract":"We investigate the possibility of guaranteeing inferential privacy for mechanisms that release useful information about some data containing sensitive information, denoted by $X$. We describe a general model of utility and privacy in which utility is achieved by disclosing the value of low-entropy features of $X$, while privacy is maintained by keeping high-entropy features of $X$ secret. Adopting this model, we prove that meaningful inferential privacy guarantees can be obtained, even though this is commonly considered to be impossible by the well-known result of Dwork and Naor. Then, we specifically discuss a privacy measure called pointwise maximal leakage (PML) whose guarantees are of the inferential type. We use PML to show that differential privacy admits an inferential formulation: it describes the information leaking about a single entry in a database assuming that every other entry is known, and considering the worst-case distribution on the data. Moreover, we define inferential instance privacy (IIP) as a bound on the (non-conditional) information leaking about a single entry in the database under the worst-case distribution, and show that it is equivalent to free-lunch privacy. Overall, our approach to privacy unifies, formalizes, and explains many existing ideas, e.g., why the informed adversary assumption may lead to underestimating the information leaking about each entry in the database. Furthermore, insights obtained from our results suggest general methods for improving privacy analyses; for example, we argue that smaller privacy parameters can be obtained by excluding low-entropy prior distributions from protection.","created":"2023-03-14","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07782v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Automated Vulnerability Detection in Source Code Using Quantum Natural Language Processing","abstract":"One of the most important challenges in the field of software code audit is the presence of vulnerabilities in software source code. These flaws are highly likely ex-ploited and lead to system compromise, data leakage, or denial of ser-vice. C and C++ open source code are now available in order to create a large-scale, classical machine-learning and quantum machine-learning system for function-level vulnerability identification. We assembled a siz-able dataset of millions of open-source functions that point to poten-tial exploits. We created an efficient and scalable vulnerability detection method based on a deep neural network model Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and quantum machine learning model Long Short Term Memory (QLSTM), that can learn features extracted from the source codes. The source code is first converted into a minimal intermediate representation to remove the pointless components and shorten the de-pendency. Therefore, We keep the semantic and syntactic information using state of the art word embedding algorithms such as Glove and fastText. The embedded vectors are subsequently fed into the classical and quantum convolutional neural networks to classify the possible vulnerabilities. To measure the performance, we used evaluation metrics such as F1 score, precision, re-call, accuracy, and total execution time. We made a comparison between the results derived from the classical LSTM and quantum LSTM using basic feature representation as well as semantic and syntactic represen-tation. We found that the QLSTM with semantic and syntactic features detects significantly accurate vulnerability and runs faster than its classical counterpart.","created":"2023-03-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07525v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Model Extraction Attacks on Split Federated Learning","abstract":"Federated Learning (FL) is a popular collaborative learning scheme involving multiple clients and a server. FL focuses on protecting clients' data but turns out to be highly vulnerable to Intellectual Property (IP) threats. Since FL periodically collects and distributes the model parameters, a free-rider can download the latest model and thus steal model IP. Split Federated Learning (SFL), a recent variant of FL that supports training with resource-constrained clients, splits the model into two, giving one part of the model to clients (client-side model), and the remaining part to the server (server-side model). Thus SFL prevents model leakage by design. Moreover, by blocking prediction queries, it can be made resistant to advanced IP threats such as traditional Model Extraction (ME) attacks. While SFL is better than FL in terms of providing IP protection, it is still vulnerable. In this paper, we expose the vulnerability of SFL and show how malicious clients can launch ME attacks by querying the gradient information from the server side. We propose five variants of ME attack which differs in the gradient usage as well as in the data assumptions. We show that under practical cases, the proposed ME attacks work exceptionally well for SFL. For instance, when the server-side model has five layers, our proposed ME attack can achieve over 90% accuracy with less than 2% accuracy degradation with VGG-11 on CIFAR-10.","created":"2023-03-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08581v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, there are still many shortcomings in the existing mining techniques for leakage source research, such as high false alarm rate, coarse-grained detection, and dependence on expert experience. In this paper, we mainly use the c/c++ source code data of the SARD dataset, process the source code of CWE476, CWE469, CWE516 and CWE570 vulnerability types, test the Joern vulnerability scanning function of the cutting-edge tool, and propose a new cascading deep learning model VMCDL based on source code control flow to effectively detect vulnerabilities. First, this paper uses joern to locate and extract sensitive functions and statements to form a sensitive statement library of vulnerable code. Then, the CFG flow vulnerability code snippets are generated by bidirectional breadth-first traversal, and then vectorized by Doc2vec. Finally, the cascade deep learning model based on source code control flow is used for classification to obtain the classification results. In the experimental evaluation, we give the test results of Joern on specific vulnerabilities, and give the confusion matrix and label data of the binary classification results of the model algorithm on single vulnerability type source code, and compare and verify the five indicators of FPR, FNR, ACC, P and F1, respectively reaching 10.30%, 5.20%, 92.50%,85.10% and 85.40%,which shows that it can effectively reduce the false alarm rate of static analysis.","created":"2023-03-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07128v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"A Novel Method Combines Moving Fronts, Data Decomposition and Deep Learning to Forecast Intricate Time Series","abstract":"A univariate time series with high variability can pose a challenge even to Deep Neural Network (DNN). To overcome this, a univariate time series is decomposed into simpler constituent series, whose sum equals the original series. As demonstrated in this article, the conventional one-time decomposition technique suffers from a leak of information from the future, referred to as a data leak. In this work, a novel Moving Front (MF) method is proposed to prevent data leakage, so that the decomposed series can be treated like other time series. Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) is a very complex time series, which poses a challenge to DNN and is therefore selected as an example. From the many signal processing tools available, Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) was chosen for decomposing the ISMR into simpler constituent series, as it was found to be more effective than the other popular algorithm, Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN). The proposed MF method was used to generate the constituent leakage-free time series. Predictions and forecasts were made by state-of-the-art Long and Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network architecture, especially suitable for making predictions of sequential patterns. The constituent MF series has been divided into training, testing, and forecasting. It has been found that the model (EWT-MF-LSTM) developed here made exceptionally good train and test predictions, as well as Walk-Forward Validation (WFV), forecasts with Performance Parameter ($PP$) values of 0.99, 0.86, and 0.95, respectively, where $PP$ = 1.0 signifies perfect reproduction of the data.","created":"2023-03-11","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06394v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this work, for the first time, DDPMs are used for 3D multiclass image segmentation. We make three key contributions that all focus on aligning the training strategy with the evaluation methodology, and improving efficiency. Firstly, the model predicts segmentation masks instead of sampled noise and is optimised directly via Dice loss. Secondly, the predicted mask in the previous time step is recycled to generate noise-corrupted masks to reduce information leakage. Finally, the diffusion process during training was reduced to five steps, the same as the evaluation. Through studies on two large multiclass data sets (prostate MR and abdominal CT), we demonstrated significantly improved performance compared to existing DDPMs, and reached competitive performance with non-diffusion segmentation models, based on U-net, within the same compute budget.

Unfortunately, its data-hungry nature implicitly requires the availability of sufficiently rich and high-quality centralized datasets, which easily leads to privacy leakage. Besides, uncertainty-awareness becomes increasingly important for safety-crucial cyber physical systems whose prediction module heavily relies on machine learning tools. In this paper, we relax the data collection requirement and enhance uncertainty-awareness by using Federated Learning on Connected Autonomous Vehicles with an uncertainty-aware global objective.

Experiments on Argoverse dataset show that FLTP significantly outperforms the model trained on local data.

With top $r$ sparsification in FL, the users only upload the most significant $r$ fraction of updates, and the servers only send the most significant $r'$ fraction of parameters to the users in order to reduce the communication cost. However, the values and the indices of the sparse updates leak information about the users' private data. In this work, we consider an FL setting where $N$ non-colluding databases store the model to be trained, from which the users download and update sparse parameters privately, without revealing the values of the updates or their indices to the databases. We propose four schemes with different properties to perform this task while achieving the minimum communication costs, and show that the information theoretic privacy of both values and positions of the sparse updates can be guaranteed. This is achieved at a considerable storage cost, though. To alleviate this, we generalize the schemes in such a way that the storage cost is reduced at the expense of a certain amount of information leakage, using a model segmentation mechanism. In general, we provide the tradeoff between communication cost, storage cost and information leakage in private FL with top $r$ sparsification.","created":"2023-03-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04123v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

These empirical privacy defenses rely on the intuition that distilled ``student'' models protect the privacy of training data, as they only interact with this data indirectly through a ``teacher'' model. In this work, we design membership inference attacks to systematically study the privacy provided by knowledge distillation to both the teacher and student training sets. Our new attacks show that distillation alone provides only limited privacy across a number of domains. We explain the success of our attacks on distillation by showing that membership inference attacks on a private dataset can succeed even if the target model is *never* queried on any actual training points, but only on inputs whose predictions are highly influenced by training data. Finally, we show that our attacks are strongest when student and teacher sets are similar, or when the attacker can poison the teacher set.","created":"2023-03-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03446v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Monitoring Fluid Saturation in Reservoirs Using Time-Lapse Full-Waveform Inversion","abstract":"Monitoring the rock-physics properties of the subsurface is of great importance for reservoir management. For either oil and gas applications or CO2 storage, seismic data are a valuable source of information for tracking changes in elastic properties which can be related to fluids saturation and pressure changes within the reservoir. Changes in elastic properties can be estimated with time-lapse full-waveform inversion (TL-FWI). Monitoring rock-physics properties, such as saturation, with TL-FWI is usually a two-step process: first, elastic properties are estimated with full-waveform inversion (FWI), then, the rock-physics properties are estimated with rock-physics inversion. However, multiparameter TL-FWI is prone to crosstalk between parameter classes across different vintages. This leads to leakage from one parameter class to another, which, in turn, can introduce large errors in the estimated rock-physics parameters. To avoid inaccuracies caused by crosstalk and the two-step inversion strategy, we reformulate TL-FWI to estimate directly the changes in the rock-physics properties. Using Gassmann's model, we adopt a new parameterization containing porosity, clay content, and water saturation (PCS). In the context of reservoir monitoring, changes are assumed to be induced by fluid substitution only. The porosity and clay content can thus be kept constant during time-lapse inversion. We compare the PCS parameterization with the usual density-velocity (DV) parameterization for different benchmark models. Results indicate that the proposed parameterization eliminates crosstalk between parameters of different vintages, leading to more accurate estimation of saturation changes. We also show that using the PCS parameterization, the elastic changes can be monitored more accurately.","created":"2023-03-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03136v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Synthetic Misinformers: Generating and Combating Multimodal Misinformation","abstract":"With the expansion of social media and the increasing dissemination of multimedia content, the spread of misinformation has become a major concern. This necessitates effective strategies for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) that detect whether the combination of an image and its accompanying text could mislead or misinform. Due to the data-intensive nature of deep neural networks and the labor-intensive process of manual annotation, researchers have been exploring various methods for automatically generating synthetic multimodal misinformation - which we refer to as Synthetic Misinformers - in order to train MMD models. However, limited evaluation on real-world misinformation and a lack of comparisons with other Synthetic Misinformers makes difficult to assess progress in the field. To address this, we perform a comparative study on existing and new Synthetic Misinformers that involves (1) out-of-context (OOC) image-caption pairs, (2) cross-modal named entity inconsistency (NEI) as well as (3) hybrid approaches and we evaluate them against real-world misinformation; using the COSMOS benchmark. The comparative study showed that our proposed CLIP-based Named Entity Swapping can lead to MMD models that surpass other OOC and NEI Misinformers in terms of multimodal accuracy and that hybrid approaches can lead to even higher detection accuracy. Nevertheless, after alleviating information leakage from the COSMOS evaluation protocol, low Sensitivity scores indicate that the task is significantly more challenging than previous studies suggested. Finally, our findings showed that NEI-based Synthetic Misinformers tend to suffer from a unimodal bias, where text-only MMDs can outperform multimodal ones.","created":"2023-03-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01217v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

We use ALIP in the watchdog and optimal random response (ORR) mechanisms, the main methods to achieve lift-based privacy. It is shown that ALIP enhances utility in these methods compared to existing local information privacy, which ensures the same (symmetric) bounds on both max and min lifts. We propose subset merging for the watchdog mechanism to improve data utility and subset random response for the ORR to reduce complexity. We then investigate the related lift-based measures, including $\\ell_1$-norm, $\\chi^2$-privacy criterion, and $\\alpha$-lift. We reveal that they can only restrict max-lift, resulting in significant min-lift leakage. To overcome this problem, we propose corresponding lift-inverse measures to restrict the min-lift. We apply these lift-based and lift-inverse measures in the watchdog mechanism. We show that they can be considered as relaxations of ALIP, where a higher utility can be achieved by bounding only average max and min lifts.","created":"2023-03-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01017v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Applying Plain Transformers to Real-World Point Clouds","abstract":"Due to the lack of inductive bias, transformer-based models usually require a large amount of training data. The problem is especially concerning in 3D vision, as 3D data are harder to acquire and annotate. To overcome this problem, previous works modify the architecture of transformers to incorporate inductive biases by applying, e.g., local attention and down-sampling. Although they have achieved promising results, earlier works on transformers for point clouds have two issues. First, the power of plain transformers is still under-explored. Second, they focus on simple and small point clouds instead of complex real-world ones. This work revisits the plain transformers in real-world point cloud understanding. We first take a closer look at some fundamental components of plain transformers, e.g., patchifier and positional embedding, for both efficiency and performance. To close the performance gap due to the lack of inductive bias and annotated data, we investigate self-supervised pre-training with masked autoencoder (MAE). Specifically, we propose drop patch, which prevents information leakage and significantly improves the effectiveness of MAE. Our models achieve SOTA results in semantic segmentation on the S3DIS dataset and object detection on the ScanNet dataset with lower computational costs. Our work provides a new baseline for future research on transformers for point clouds.","created":"2023-02-28","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00086v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

To mitigate the impact of intermittent links, nodes can collaborate with their neighbors to compute local consensus which they forward to the central server. In such a setup, the communications between any pair of nodes must satisfy local differential privacy constraints. We study the tradeoff between collaborative relaying and privacy leakage due to the additional data sharing among nodes and, subsequently, propose a novel differentially private collaborative algorithm for DME to achieve the optimal tradeoff. Finally, we present numerical simulations to substantiate our theoretical findings.","created":"2023-02-28","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00035v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

CAD is computationally expensive, with worst-case doubly-exponential complexity. Selecting an optimal variable ordering is paramount to efficient use of CAD. Prior work has demonstrated that machine learning can be useful in determining efficient variable orderings. Much of this work has been driven by CAD problems extracted from applications of the MetiTarski theorem prover. In this paper, we revisit this prior work and consider issues of bias in existing training and test data. We observe that the classical MetiTarski benchmarks are heavily biased towards particular variable orderings. To address this, we apply symmetries to create a new dataset containing more than 41K MetiTarski challenges designed to remove bias.

{"title":"Do as You Say: Consistency Detection of Data Practice in Program Code and Privacy Policy in Mini-App","abstract":"Mini-app is an emerging form of mobile application that combines web technology with native capabilities. Its features, e.g., no need to download and no installation, have made it popular rapidly. However, privacy issues that violate the laws or regulations are breeding in the swiftly expanding mini-app ecosystem. The consistency between what the mini-app does about the data in the program code and what it declares in its privacy policy description is important. But no work has systematically investigated the privacy problem of the mini-app before. In this paper, to our best knowledge, we are the first to conduct the compliance detection of data practice and policy description in mini-apps. In this paper, we first customize a taint analysis method based on data entity dependency network to adapt to the characteristics of the JavaScript language in the mini-apps. Then, we transform data types and data operations to data practices in program codes and privacy policies, so as to finish a fine-grained consistency matching model.We crawl 100,000 mini-apps on WeChat client in the wild and extract 2,998 with a privacy policy. Among them, only 318 meet the consistency requirements, 2,680 are inconsistent, and the proportion of inconsistencies is as high as 89.4%. The inconsistency in the mini-app is very serious. Based on 6 real-world cases analyzed, in order to reduce this potential data leakage risk, we suggest that the developer should reduce the collection of irrelevant information and the straightforward use of templates, and the platform should provide data flow detection tools and privacy policy writing support.","created":"2023-02-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13860v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"FLAG: Fast Label-Adaptive Aggregation for Multi-label Classification in Federated Learning","abstract":"Federated learning aims to share private data to maximize the data utility without privacy leakage. Previous federated learning research mainly focuses on multi-class classification problems. However, multi-label classification is a crucial research problem close to real-world data properties. Nevertheless, a limited number of federated learning studies explore this research problem. Existing studies of multi-label federated learning did not consider the characteristics of multi-label data, i.e., they used the concept of multi-class classification to verify their methods' performance, which means it will not be feasible to apply their methods to real-world applications. Therefore, this study proposed a new multi-label federated learning framework with a Clustering-based Multi-label Data Allocation (CMDA) and a novel aggregation method, Fast Label-Adaptive Aggregation (FLAG), for multi-label classification in the federated learning environment. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods only need less than 50\\% of training epochs and communication rounds to surpass the performance of state-of-the-art federated learning methods.","created":"2023-02-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13571v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Most widely-used feature attribution methods (such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM) are \"class-dependent\" methods in that they generate a feature attribution vector as a function of class. In this work, we demonstrate that class-dependent methods can \"leak\" information about the selected class, making that class appear more likely than it is. Thus, an end user runs the risk of drawing false conclusions when interpreting an explanation generated by a class-dependent method. In contrast, we introduce \"distribution-aware\" methods, which favor explanations that keep the label's distribution close to its distribution given all features of the input. We introduce SHAP-KL and FastSHAP-KL, two baseline distribution-aware methods that compute Shapley values.

{"title":"FedDBL: Communication and Data Efficient Federated Deep-Broad Learning for Histopathological Tissue Classification","abstract":"Histopathological tissue classification is a fundamental task in computational pathology. Deep learning-based models have achieved superior performance but centralized training with data centralization suffers from the privacy leakage problem. Federated learning (FL) can safeguard privacy by keeping training samples locally, but existing FL-based frameworks require a large number of well-annotated training samples and numerous rounds of communication which hinder their practicability in the real-world clinical scenario. In this paper, we propose a universal and lightweight federated learning framework, named Federated Deep-Broad Learning (FedDBL), to achieve superior classification performance with limited training samples and only one-round communication. By simply associating a pre-trained deep learning feature extractor, a fast and lightweight broad learning inference system and a classical federated aggregation approach, FedDBL can dramatically reduce data dependency and improve communication efficiency. Five-fold cross-validation demonstrates that FedDBL greatly outperforms the competitors with only one-round communication and limited training samples, while it even achieves comparable performance with the ones under multiple-round communications. Furthermore, due to the lightweight design and one-round communication, FedDBL reduces the communication burden from 4.6GB to only 276.5KB per client using the ResNet-50 backbone at 50-round training. Since no data or deep model sharing across different clients, the privacy issue is well-solved and the model security is guaranteed with no model inversion attack risk.

We study the recently proposed SoundDesc benchmark dataset, which was automatically sourced from the BBC Sound Effects web page. In our analysis, we find that SoundDesc contains several duplicates that cause leakage of training data to the evaluation data. This data leakage ultimately leads to overly optimistic retrieval performance estimates in previous benchmarks. We propose new training, validation, and testing splits for the dataset that we make available online. To avoid weak contamination of the test data, we pool audio files that share similar recording setups.

{"title":"A critical look at the evaluation of GNNs under heterophily: are we really making progress?","abstract":"Node classification is a classical graph representation learning task on which Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently achieved strong results. However, it is often believed that standard GNNs only work well for homophilous graphs, i.e., graphs where edges tend to connect nodes of the same class. Graphs without this property are called heterophilous, and it is typically assumed that specialized methods are required to achieve strong performance on such graphs. In this work, we challenge this assumption. First, we show that the standard datasets used for evaluating heterophily-specific models have serious drawbacks, making results obtained by using them unreliable. The most significant of these drawbacks is the presence of a large number of duplicate nodes in the datsets Squirrel and Chameleon, which leads to train-test data leakage. We show that removing duplicate nodes strongly affects GNN performance on these datasets. Then, we propose a set of heterophilous graphs of varying properties that we believe can serve as a better benchmark for evaluating the performance of GNNs under heterophily. We show that standard GNNs achieve strong results on these heterophilous graphs, almost always outperforming specialized models.

A CMOS-based application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) fabricated in 14nm FinFET technology was used to generate and sequence qubit control waveforms and demonstrate a two-qubit cross resonance gate between fixed frequency transmons. The controller was thermally anchored to the T = 4K stage of a dilution refrigerator and the measured power was 23 mW per qubit under active control. The chip generated single--side banded output frequencies between 4.5 and 5.5 GHz with a maximum power output of -18 dBm. Randomized benchmarking (RB) experiments revealed an average number of 1.71 instructions per Clifford (IPC) for single-qubit gates, and 17.51 IPC for two-qubit gates. A single-qubit error per gate of $\\epsilon_{\\text{1Q}}$=8e-4 and two-qubit error per gate of $\\epsilon_\\text{2Q}$=1.4e-2 is shown. A drive-induced Z-rotation is observed by way of a rotary echo experiment; this observation is consistent with expected qubit behavior given measured excess local oscillator (LO) leakage from the CMOS chip. The effect of spurious drive induced Z-errors is numerically evaluated with a two-qubit model Hamiltonian, and shown to be in good agreement with measured RB data. The modeling results suggest the Z-error varies linearly with pulse amplitude.","created":"2023-02-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11538v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this paper, we explore methods for recovering private speech/speaker information from the shared gradients in distributed learning settings.

Processing individual updates to manage adversarial behavior, while preserving privacy of data against colluding nodes, requires some sort of secure secret sharing. However, communication load for secret sharing of long vectors of updates can be very high. To resolve this issue, in the proposed scheme, local updates are partitioned into smaller sub-vectors and shared using ramp secret sharing. However, this sharing method does not admit bi-linear computations, such as pairwise distance calculations, needed by outlier-detection algorithms. To overcome this issue, each user runs another round of ramp sharing, with different embedding of data in the sharing polynomial. This technique, motivated by ideas from coded computing, enables secure computation of pairwise distance. In addition, to maintain the integrity and privacy of the local update, the proposed scheme also uses a vector commitment method, in which the commitment size remains constant (i.e. does not increase with the length of the local update), while simultaneously allowing verification of the secret sharing process.","created":"2023-02-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09913v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this paper, we proposed PPPML-HMI, an open-source learning paradigm for personalized and privacy-preserving federated heterogeneous medical image analysis. To our best knowledge, personalization and privacy protection were achieved simultaneously for the first time under the federated scenario by integrating the PerFedAvg algorithm and designing our novel cyclic secure aggregation with the homomorphic encryption algorithm.

However, privacy issues make it challenging for users to share their information unless receiving sufficient compensation. Differential Privacy (DP) is a promising mechanism to release helpful information while protecting individuals' privacy. However, most DP mechanisms only consider a fixed compensation for each user's privacy loss. In this paper, we design a task assignment scheme that allows workers to dynamically improve their utility with dynamic distance privacy leakage. Specifically, we propose two solutions to improve the total utility of task assignment results, namely Private Utility Conflict-Elimination (PUCE) approach and Private Game Theory (PGT) approach, respectively.

Specifically, clients employ Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based encoders to obtain the internal temporal patterns inside traffic data sequences. Then, the central server evaluates spatial correlation among clients via Graph Attention Network (GAT), catering to the dynamic changes of spatial closeness caused by traffic fluctuation. Furthermore, to improve the generalization of the global model for upcoming traffic data, a period-aware aggregation mechanism is proposed to aggregate the local models which are optimized using Online Gradient Descent (OGD) algorithm at clients.

Nevertheless, recent studies have illustrated that FL still suffers from information leakage as adversaries try to recover the training data by analyzing shared parameters from local clients. To deal with this issue, differential privacy (DP) is adopted to add noise to the gradients of local models before aggregation. It, however, results in the poor performance of gradient-based interpretability methods, since some weights capturing the salient region in feature map will be perturbed. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive differential privacy (ADP) mechanism that selectively adds noisy perturbations to the gradients of client models in FL. We also theoretically analyze the impact of gradient perturbation on the model interpretability. Finally, extensive experiments on both IID and Non-IID data demonstrate that the proposed ADP can achieve a good trade-off between privacy and interpretability in FL.","created":"2023-02-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08044v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, these features are often not interpretable, and thus can reveal limited insights to domain experts. Instead of obtaining features from language models, we propose BLIAM, a literature-based data synthesis approach to directly generate training data points that are interpretable and model-agnostic to downstream applications. The key idea of BLIAM is to create prompts using existing training data and then use these prompts to synthesize new data points. BLIAM performs these two steps iteratively as new data points will define more informative prompts and new prompts will in turn synthesize more accurate data points. Notably, literature-based data augmentation might introduce data leakage since labels of test data points in downstream applications might have already been mentioned in the language model corpus. To prevent such leakage, we introduce GDSC-combo, a large-scale drug combination discovery dataset that was published after the biomedical language model was trained. We found that BLIAM substantially outperforms a non-augmented approach and manual prompting in this rigorous data split setting. BLIAM can be further used to synthesize data points for novel drugs and cell lines that were not even measured in biomedical experiments.

Robust AI model training requires large datasets, but data collection faces communication, ethics, and privacy protection constraints. Fortunately, federated learning can solve the above problems by coordinating multiple clients to train the model without sharing the original data. In this study, we design a federated contrastive learning framework (FCL) for large-scale pathology images and the heterogeneity challenges. It enhances the model's generalization ability by maximizing the attention consistency between the local client and server models. To alleviate the privacy leakage problem when transferring parameters and verify the robustness of FCL, we use differential privacy to further protect the model by adding noise. We evaluate the effectiveness of FCL on the cancer diagnosis task and Gleason grading task on 19,635 prostate cancer WSIs from multiple clients. In the diagnosis task, the average AUC of 7 clients is 95% when the categories are relatively balanced, and our FCL achieves 97%.

This leads to cyber-threats, such as denial-of-service, modification of data, information leakage, spreading of malware, and many others. Cyber-resilience refers to the ability of a CPS to prepare, absorb, recover, and adapt to the adverse effects associated with cyber-threats, e.g., physical degradation of the CPS performance resulting from a cyber-attack. Cyber-resilience aims at ensuring CPS survival, by keeping the core functionalities of the CPS in case of extreme events. The literature on cyber-resilience is rapidly increasing, leading to a broad variety of research works addressing this new topic. In this article, we create a systematization of knowledge about existing scientific efforts of making CPS cyber-resilient.

Although recently proposed federated recommendation systems can mitigate the privacy problem, they either restrict the on-device local training to an isolated ego graph or rely on an additional third-party server to access other ego graphs resulting in a cumbersome pipeline, which is hard to work in practice. In addition, existing federated recommendation systems require resource-limited devices to maintain the entire embedding tables resulting in high communication costs.   In light of this, we propose a semi-decentralized federated ego graph learning framework for on-device recommendations, named SemiDFEGL, which introduces new device-to-device collaborations to improve scalability and reduce communication costs and innovatively utilizes predicted interacted item nodes to connect isolated ego graphs to augment local subgraphs such that the high-order user-item collaborative information could be used in a privacy-preserving manner. Furthermore, the proposed framework is model-agnostic, meaning that it could be seamlessly integrated with existing graph neural network-based recommendation methods and privacy protection techniques. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed SemiDFEGL, extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SemiDFEGL compared to other federated recommendation methods.","created":"2023-02-10","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10900v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Bag of Tricks for Training Data Extraction from Language Models","abstract":"With the advance of language models, privacy protection is receiving more attention. Training data extraction is therefore of great importance, as it can serve as a potential tool to assess privacy leakage. However, due to the difficulty of this task, most of the existing methods are proof-of-concept and still not effective enough. In this paper, we investigate and benchmark tricks for improving training data extraction using a publicly available dataset. Because most existing extraction methods use a pipeline of generating-then-ranking, i.e., generating text candidates as potential training data and then ranking them based on specific criteria, our research focuses on the tricks for both text generation (e.g., sampling strategy) and text ranking (e.g., token-level criteria). The experimental results show that several previously overlooked tricks can be crucial to the success of training data extraction. Based on the GPT-Neo 1.3B evaluation results, our proposed tricks outperform the baseline by a large margin in most cases, providing a much stronger baseline for future research.","created":"2023-02-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04460v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Exploratory Analysis of Federated Learning Methods with Differential Privacy on MIMIC-III","abstract":"Background: Federated learning methods offer the possibility of training machine learning models on privacy-sensitive data sets, which cannot be easily shared. Multiple regulations pose strict requirements on the storage and usage of healthcare data, leading to data being in silos (i.e. locked-in at healthcare facilities). The application of federated algorithms on these datasets could accelerate disease diagnostic, drug development, as well as improve patient care.   Methods: We present an extensive evaluation of the impact of different federation and differential privacy techniques when training models on the open-source MIMIC-III dataset. We analyze a set of parameters influencing a federated model performance, namely data distribution (homogeneous and heterogeneous), communication strategies (communication rounds vs. local training epochs), federation strategies (FedAvg vs. FedProx). Furthermore, we assess and compare two differential privacy (DP) techniques during model training: a stochastic gradient descent-based differential privacy algorithm (DP-SGD), and a sparse vector differential privacy technique (DP-SVT).   Results: Our experiments show that extreme data distributions across sites (imbalance either in the number of patients or the positive label ratios between sites) lead to a deterioration of model performance when trained using the FedAvg strategy. This issue is resolved when using FedProx with the use of appropriate hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, the results show that both differential privacy techniques can reach model performances similar to those of models trained without DP, however at the expense of a large quantifiable privacy leakage.   Conclusions: We evaluate empirically the benefits of two federation strategies and propose optimal strategies for the choice of parameters when using differential privacy techniques.","created":"2023-02-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04208v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Improving the Model Consistency of Decentralized Federated Learning","abstract":"To mitigate the privacy leakages and communication burdens of Federated Learning (FL), decentralized FL (DFL) discards the central server and each client only communicates with its neighbors in a decentralized communication network. However, existing DFL suffers from high inconsistency among local clients, which results in severe distribution shift and inferior performance compared with centralized FL (CFL), especially on heterogeneous data or sparse communication topology. To alleviate this issue, we propose two DFL algorithms named DFedSAM and DFedSAM-MGS to improve the performance of DFL. Specifically, DFedSAM leverages gradient perturbation to generate local flat models via Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM), which searches for models with uniformly low loss values. DFedSAM-MGS further boosts DFedSAM by adopting Multiple Gossip Steps (MGS) for better model consistency, which accelerates the aggregation of local flat models and better balances communication complexity and generalization. Theoretically, we present improved convergence rates $\\small \\mathcal{O}\\big(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{KT}}+\\frac{1}{T}+\\frac{1}{K^{1/2}T^{3/2}(1-\\lambda)^2}\\big)$ and $\\small \\mathcal{O}\\big(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{KT}}+\\frac{1}{T}+\\frac{\\lambda^Q+1}{K^{1/2}T^{3/2}(1-\\lambda^Q)^2}\\big)$ in non-convex setting for DFedSAM and DFedSAM-MGS, respectively, where $1-\\lambda$ is the spectral gap of gossip matrix and $Q$ is the number of MGS. Empirically, our methods can achieve competitive performance compared with CFL methods and outperform existing DFL methods.","created":"2023-02-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04083v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Lyman continuum leaker candidates among highly ionised, low-redshift dwarf galaxies selected from HeII","abstract":"Contemporary research suggests that the reionisation of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the early Universe was predominantly realised by star-forming (proto-)galaxies (SFGs). Due to observational constraints, our knowledge on the origins of sufficient amounts of ionising Lyman continuum (LyC) photons and the mechanisms facilitating their transport into the IGM remains sparse. Recent efforts have thus focussed on the study of local analogues to these high-redshift objects.   We used archival spectroscopic SDSS DR12 data to select a sample of low-z He II 4686 emitters and restricted it to a set of SFGs with an emission line diagnostic sensitive to the presence of an AGN, which serves as our only selection criterion. Our final sample consists of eighteen low-mass, low-metallicity dwarf galaxies which appear to be predominantly ionised by stellar sources. We find large O32 ratios and [S II] deficiencies, which provide strong indications for these galaxies to be LyC Emitters (LCEs). At least 40% of these objects are candidates for featuring cosmologically significant LyC escape fractions >10%. Their SFHs exhibit strong similarities and almost all galaxies appear to contain an old (>1 Gyr) stellar component, while also harbouring a young, two-stage (~10 Myr and <1 Myr) starburst, which we speculate might be related to LyC escape.   The properties of the compact emission line galaxies presented here align well with those observed in many local LCEs. In fact, our sample may prove as an extension to the rather small catalogue of local LCEs, as the extreme interstellar medium (ISM) conditions we find are assumed to facilitate LyC leakage. Notably, all of our eighteen candidates are significantly closer (z<0.1) than most established LCEs. If the inferred LyC photon loss is genuine, this demonstrates that selecting SFGs from He II 4686 is a powerful selection criterion in the search for LCEs.","created":"2023-02-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02868v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Federated Privacy-preserving Collaborative Filtering for On-Device Next App Prediction","abstract":"In this study, we propose a novel SeqMF model to solve the problem of predicting the next app launch during mobile device usage. Although this problem can be represented as a classical collaborative filtering problem, it requires proper modification since the data are sequential, the user feedback is distributed among devices and the transmission of users' data to aggregate common patterns must be protected against leakage. According to such requirements, we modify the structure of the classical matrix factorization model and update the training procedure to sequential learning. Since the data about user experience are distributed among devices, the federated learning setup is used to train the proposed sequential matrix factorization model. One more ingredient of the proposed approach is a new privacy mechanism that guarantees the protection of the sent data from the users to the remote server. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model we use publicly available mobile user behavior data. We compare our model with sequential rules and models based on the frequency of app launches. The comparison is conducted in static and dynamic environments. The static environment evaluates how our model processes sequential data compared to competitors. Therefore, the standard train-validation-test evaluation procedure is used. The dynamic environment emulates the real-world scenario, where users generate new data by running apps on devices, and evaluates our model in this case. Our experiments show that the proposed model provides comparable quality with other methods in the static environment. However, more importantly, our method achieves a better privacy-utility trade-off than competitors in the dynamic environment, which provides more accurate simulations of real-world usage.","created":"2023-02-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04744v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"GAN-based federated learning for label protection in binary classification","abstract":"As an emerging technique, vertical federated learning collaborates with different data sources to jointly train a machine learning model without data exchange. However, federated learning is computationally expensive and inefficient in modeling due to complex encryption algorithms and secure computation protocols. Split learning offers an alternative solution to circumvent these challenges. Despite this, vanilla split learning still suffers privacy leakage. Here, we propose the Generative Adversarial Federated Model (GAFM), which integrates the vanilla split learning framework with the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for protection against label leakage from gradients in binary classification tasks. We compare our proposal to existing models, including Marvell, Max Norm, and SplitNN, on three publicly available datasets, where GAFM shows significant improvement regarding the trade-off between classification accuracy and label privacy protection. We also provide heuristic justification for why GAFM can improve over baselines and demonstrate that GAFM offers label protection through gradient perturbation compared to SplitNN.","created":"2023-02-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02245v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Relating EEG to continuous speech using deep neural networks: a review","abstract":"Objective. When a person listens to continuous speech, a corresponding response is elicited in the brain and can be recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Linear models are presently used to relate the EEG recording to the corresponding speech signal. The ability of linear models to find a mapping between these two signals is used as a measure of neural tracking of speech. Such models are limited as they assume linearity in the EEG-speech relationship, which omits the nonlinear dynamics of the brain. As an alternative, deep learning models have recently been used to relate EEG to continuous speech, especially in auditory attention decoding (AAD) and single-speech-source paradigms. Approach. This paper reviews and comments on deep-learning-based studies that relate EEG to continuous speech in AAD and single-speech-source paradigms. We point out recurrent methodological pitfalls and the need for a standard benchmark of model analysis. Main results. We gathered 28 studies. The main methodological issues we found are biased cross-validations, data leakage leading to over-fitted models, or disproportionate data size compared to the model's complexity. In addition, we address requirements for a standard benchmark model analysis, such as public datasets, common evaluation metrics, and good practices for the match-mismatch task. Significance. We are the first to present a review paper summarizing the main deep-learning-based studies that relate EEG to speech while addressing methodological pitfalls and important considerations for this newly expanding field.

{"title":"GTV: Generating Tabular Data via Vertical Federated Learning","abstract":"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in tabular data synthesis, under the presumption of direct accessible training data. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a paradigm which allows to distributedly train machine learning model with clients possessing unique features pertaining to the same individuals, where the tabular data learning is the primary use case. However, it is unknown if tabular GANs can be learned in VFL. Demand for secure data transfer among clients and GAN during training and data synthesizing poses extra challenge. Conditional vector for tabular GANs is a valuable tool to control specific features of generated data. But it contains sensitive information from real data - risking privacy guarantees. In this paper, we propose GTV, a VFL framework for tabular GANs, whose key components are generator, discriminator and the conditional vector. GTV proposes an unique distributed training architecture for generator and discriminator to access training data in a privacy-preserving manner. To accommodate conditional vector into training without privacy leakage, GTV designs a mechanism training-with-shuffling to ensure that no party can reconstruct training data with conditional vector. We evaluate the effectiveness of GTV in terms of synthetic data quality, and overall training scalability. Results show that GTV can consistently generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data of comparable quality to that generated by centralized GAN algorithm. The difference on machine learning utility can be as low as to 2.7%, even under extremely imbalanced data distributions across clients and different number of clients.","created":"2023-02-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01706v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"FCB-SwinV2 Transformer for Polyp Segmentation","abstract":"Polyp segmentation within colonoscopy video frames using deep learning models has the potential to automate the workflow of clinicians. This could help improve the early detection rate and characterization of polyps which could progress to colorectal cancer. Recent state-of-the-art deep learning polyp segmentation models have combined the outputs of Fully Convolutional Network architectures and Transformer Network architectures which work in parallel. In this paper we propose modifications to the current state-of-the-art polyp segmentation model FCBFormer. The transformer architecture of the FCBFormer is replaced with a SwinV2 Transformer-UNET and minor changes to the Fully Convolutional Network architecture are made to create the FCB-SwinV2 Transformer. The performance of the FCB-SwinV2 Transformer is evaluated on the popular colonoscopy segmentation bench-marking datasets Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB. Generalizability tests are also conducted. The FCB-SwinV2 Transformer is able to consistently achieve higher mDice scores across all tests conducted and therefore represents new state-of-the-art performance. Issues found with how colonoscopy segmentation model performance is evaluated within literature are also re-ported and discussed. One of the most important issues identified is that when evaluating performance on the CVC-ClinicDB dataset it would be preferable to ensure no data leakage from video sequences occurs during the training/validation/test data partition.","created":"2023-02-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01027v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Analyzing Leakage of Personally Identifiable Information in Language Models","abstract":"Language Models (LMs) have been shown to leak information about training data through sentence-level membership inference and reconstruction attacks. Understanding the risk of LMs leaking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) has received less attention, which can be attributed to the false assumption that dataset curation techniques such as scrubbing are sufficient to prevent PII leakage. Scrubbing techniques reduce but do not prevent the risk of PII leakage: in practice scrubbing is imperfect and must balance the trade-off between minimizing disclosure and preserving the utility of the dataset. On the other hand, it is unclear to which extent algorithmic defenses such as differential privacy, designed to guarantee sentence- or user-level privacy, prevent PII disclosure. In this work, we introduce rigorous game-based definitions for three types of PII leakage via black-box extraction, inference, and reconstruction attacks with only API access to an LM. We empirically evaluate the attacks against GPT-2 models fine-tuned with and without defenses in three domains: case law, health care, and e-mails. Our main contributions are (i) novel attacks that can extract up to 10$\\times$ more PII sequences than existing attacks, (ii) showing that sentence-level differential privacy reduces the risk of PII disclosure but still leaks about 3% of PII sequences, and (iii) a subtle connection between record-level membership inference and PII reconstruction.

{"title":"CATFL: Certificateless Authentication-based Trustworthy Federated Learning for 6G Semantic Communications","abstract":"Federated learning (FL) provides an emerging approach for collaboratively training semantic encoder/decoder models of semantic communication systems, without private user data leaving the devices. Most existing studies on trustworthy FL aim to eliminate data poisoning threats that are produced by malicious clients, but in many cases, eliminating model poisoning attacks brought by fake servers is also an important objective. In this paper, a certificateless authentication-based trustworthy federated learning (CATFL) framework is proposed, which mutually authenticates the identity of clients and server. In CATFL, each client verifies the server's signature information before accepting the delivered global model to ensure that the global model is not delivered by false servers. On the contrary, the server also verifies the server's signature information before accepting the delivered model updates to ensure that they are submitted by authorized clients. Compared to PKI-based methods, the CATFL can avoid too high certificate management overheads. Meanwhile, the anonymity of clients shields data poisoning attacks, while real-name registration may suffer from user-specific privacy leakage risks. Therefore, a pseudonym generation strategy is also presented in CATFL to achieve a trade-off between identity traceability and user anonymity, which is essential to conditionally prevent from user-specific privacy leakage. Theoretical security analysis and evaluation results validate the superiority of CATFL.","created":"2023-02-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00271v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"M3FAS: An Accurate and Robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing System","abstract":"Face presentation attacks (FPA), also known as face spoofing, have brought increasing concerns to the public through various malicious applications, such as financial fraud and privacy leakage. Therefore, safeguarding face recognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing learning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding detection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer significant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies seek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the presentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these methods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth and infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity mobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when either modality is missing or of poor quality. In this paper, we devise an accurate and robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing system named M3FAS to overcome the issues above. The innovation of this work mainly lies in the following aspects: (1) To achieve robust PAD, our system combines visual and auditory modalities using three pervasively available sensors: camera, speaker, and microphone; (2) We design a novel two-branch neural network with three hierarchical feature aggregation modules to perform cross-modal feature fusion; (3).

To make the information leakage of the identifiers to the eavesdropper via helper data negligible, private keys, uniformly and independently chosen, are bonded to measurements of the identifiers at the encoders to generate the helper data. The CEO problem is renowned for the difficulty in characterizing the tight rate-distortion region, which is still an open question for the general case. In this study, we characterize the tight rate-key-distortion regions of such a problem under two specific distortion measures, namely logarithmic loss (both discrete and Gaussian settings) and quadratic distortion measures. We also provide numerical calculations of the characterized regions, and the calculated results show that when a larger distortion is permitted, smaller storage and private-key rates are achievable. For special cases where the constraints of private-key rates and negligible leakage are not imposed, our characterizations naturally reduce to the rate-distortion regions provided by Courtade and Weissman (2014) for logarithmic loss distortion, and Prabhakaran et al.

In reality, a lot of these raw data are stored in the graph database, especially for finance. For collaboratively building graph neural networks(GNNs), federated learning(FL) may not be an ideal choice for the vertically partitioned setting where privacy and efficiency are the main concerns. Moreover, almost all the existing federated GNNs are mainly designed for homogeneous graphs, which simplify various types of relations as the same type, thus largely limits their performance. We bridge this gap by proposing a split learning-based GNN(SplitGNN), where this model is divided into two sub-models: the local GNN model includes all the private data related computation to generate local node embeddings, whereas the global model calculates global embeddings by aggregating all the participants' local embeddings. Our SplitGNN allows the isolated heterogeneous neighborhood to be collaboratively utilized. To better capture representations, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Attention(HAT) algorithm and use both node-based and path-based attention mechanisms to learn various types of nodes and edges with multi-hop relation features.

Efficient storage, transmission, and analysation of this real-time big data is important, as it serves a number of purposes ranging from decision making to fault prediction, etc. Alongside this, real-time big data has rigorous utility and privacy requirements, therefore, it is also significantly important to choose the handling strategies meticulously. One of the optimal way to store and transmit data in the form of lossless compression is Huffman coding, which compresses the data into a variable length binary stream. Similarly, in order to protect the privacy of such big data, differential privacy is being used nowadays, which perturbs the data on the basis of privacy budget and sensitivity. Nevertheless, traditional differential privacy mechanisms provide privacy guarantees. However, on the other hand, real-time data cannot be dealt as an ordinary set of records, because it usually has certain underlying patterns and cycles, which can be used for forming a link to a specific individuals private information that can lead to severe privacy leakages (e.g., analysing smart metering data can lead to classification of individuals daily routine). Thus, it is equally important to develop a privacy preservation model, which preserves the privacy on the basis of occurrences and patterns in the data. In this paper, we design a novel Huff-DP mechanism, which selects the optimal privacy budget on the basis of privacy requirement for that specific record. In order to further enhance the budget determination, we propose static, sine, and fuzzy logic based decision algorithms. From the experimental evaluations, it can be concluded that our proposed Huff-DP mechanism provides effective privacy protection alongside reducing the privacy budget computational cost.","created":"2023-01-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10395v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Hence, researchers have been exploring different energy-efficient solutions such as near-sensor processing, in-sensor processing, and in-pixel processing, bringing the computation closer to the sensor. In particular, in-pixel processing embeds the computation capabilities inside the pixel array and achieves high energy efficiency by generating low-level features instead of the raw data stream from CMOS image sensors. Many different in-pixel processing techniques and approaches have been demonstrated on conventional frame-based CMOS imagers, however, the processing-in-pixel approach for neuromorphic vision sensors has not been explored so far. In this work, we for the first time, propose an asynchronous non-von-Neumann analog processing-in-pixel paradigm to perform convolution operations by integrating in-situ multi-bit multi-channel convolution inside the pixel array performing analog multiply and accumulate (MAC) operations that consume significantly less energy than their digital MAC alternative. To make this approach viable, we incorporate the circuit's non-ideality, leakage, and process variations into a novel hardware-algorithm co-design framework that leverages extensive HSpice simulations of our proposed circuit using the GF22nm FD-SOI technology node. We verified our framework on state-of-the-art neuromorphic vision sensor datasets and show that our solution consumes ~2x lower backend-processor energy while maintaining almost similar front-end (sensor) energy on the IBM DVS128-Gesture dataset than the state-of-the-art while maintaining a high test accuracy of 88.36%.","created":"2023-01-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09111v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Split Ways: Privacy-Preserving Training of Encrypted Data Using Split Learning","abstract":"Split Learning (SL) is a new collaborative learning technique that allows participants, e.g. a client and a server, to train machine learning models without the client sharing raw data. In this setting, the client initially applies its part of the machine learning model on the raw data to generate activation maps and then sends them to the server to continue the training process. Previous works in the field demonstrated that reconstructing activation maps could result in privacy leakage of client data. In addition to that, existing mitigation techniques that overcome the privacy leakage of SL prove to be significantly worse in terms of accuracy. In this paper, we improve upon previous works by constructing a protocol based on U-shaped SL that can operate on homomorphically encrypted data. More precisely, in our approach, the client applies Homomorphic Encryption (HE) on the activation maps before sending them to the server, thus protecting user privacy. This is an important improvement that reduces privacy leakage in comparison to other SL-based works. Finally, our results show that, with the optimum set of parameters, training with HE data in the U-shaped SL setting only reduces accuracy by 2.65% compared to training on plaintext.

{"title":"On the Relationship Between Information-Theoretic Privacy Metrics And Probabilistic Information Privacy","abstract":"Information-theoretic (IT) measures based on $f$-divergences have recently gained interest as a measure of privacy leakage as they allow for trading off privacy against utility using only a single-value characterization. However, their operational interpretations in the privacy context are unclear. In this paper, we relate the notion of probabilistic information privacy (IP) to several IT privacy metrics based on $f$-divergences. We interpret probabilistic IP under both the detection and estimation frameworks and link it to differential privacy, thus allowing a precise operational interpretation of these IT privacy metrics. We show that the $\\chi^2$-divergence privacy metric is stronger than those based on total variation distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Therefore, we further develop a data-driven empirical risk framework based on the $\\chi^2$-divergence privacy metric and realized using deep neural networks. This framework is agnostic to the adversarial attack model. Empirical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.","created":"2023-01-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08401v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Label Inference Attack against Split Learning under Regression Setting","abstract":"As a crucial building block in vertical Federated Learning (vFL), Split Learning (SL) has demonstrated its practice in the two-party model training collaboration, where one party holds the features of data samples and another party holds the corresponding labels. Such method is claimed to be private considering the shared information is only the embedding vectors and gradients instead of private raw data and labels. However, some recent works have shown that the private labels could be leaked by the gradients. These existing attack only works under the classification setting where the private labels are discrete. In this work, we step further to study the leakage in the scenario of the regression model, where the private labels are continuous numbers (instead of discrete labels in classification). This makes previous attacks harder to infer the continuous labels due to the unbounded output range. To address the limitation, we propose a novel learning-based attack that integrates gradient information and extra learning regularization objectives in aspects of model training properties, which can infer the labels under regression settings effectively. The comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed attack. We hope our work can pave the way for future analyses that make the vFL framework more secure.","created":"2023-01-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07284v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Contrast with Major Classifier Vectors for Federated Medical Relation Extraction with Heterogeneous Label Distribution","abstract":"Federated medical relation extraction enables multiple clients to train a deep network collaboratively without sharing their raw medical data. In order to handle the heterogeneous label distribution across clients, most of the existing works only involve enforcing regularization between local and global models during optimization. In this paper, we fully utilize the models of all clients and propose a novel concept of \\textit{major classifier vectors}, where a group of class vectors is obtained in an ensemble rather than the weighted average method on the server. The major classifier vectors are then distributed to all clients and the local training of each client is Contrasted with Major Classifier vectors (FedCMC), so the local model is not prone to overfitting to the local label distribution. FedCMC requires only a small amount of additional transfer of classifier parameters without any leakage of raw data, extracted representations, and label distributions. Our extensive experiments show that FedCMC outperforms the other state-of-the-art FL algorithms on three medical relation extraction datasets.","created":"2023-01-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05376v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers: evaluation of geomechanical risks using integrated modeling workflow","abstract":"CO2 injection into a saline aquifer crossed by a tectonic fault is studied with coupled fluid mechanics - geomechanics modeling. The model is based on reservoir simulator MUFITS and mechanical simulator FLAC3D linked by the in-house algorithm of the data exchange. MUFITS simulates the non-isothermal multiphase flow of CO2 and brine in rock formation accounting for phase transitions and thermal effects. The modeling workflow is sequential, so that hydrodynamical simulations are carried out at a certain time interval, after which pressure, temperature, and density distributions are passed to FLAC3D, which calculates the equilibrium mechanical state. Computed deformations and stresses are utilized to update the porosity and permeability fields for the subsequent hydrodynamic modeling. In particular, we focus on the tectonic fault and its behavior during CO2 injection. We distinguish the damage zone and core inside the fault and derive the closure relations for their permeability alteration analytically. The developed coupled approach is applied to simulate CO2 injection into synthetic and realistic reservoir models. For the former one, we study the effect of formation depth and presence of the tectonic stresses at the initial mechanical state, while for the latter, we consider different injection modes (bottomhole pressure). In each numerical experiment, we describe the evolution of the fault permeability due to the slip along its plane and the development of plastic deformations leading to the loss of reservoir integrity and CO2 leakage. Sensitivity analysis of the coupled model to realistic values of input parameters to assess the fault stability is carried out.","created":"2023-01-12","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04931v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Objective Evaluation-based High-efficiency Learning Framework for Hyperspectral Image Classification","abstract":"Deep learning methods have been successfully applied to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification with remarkable performance. Because of limited labelled HSI data, earlier studies primarily adopted a patch-based classification framework, which divides images into overlapping patches for training and testing. However, this approach results in redundant computations and possible information leakage. In this study, we propose an objective evaluation-based high-efficiency learning framework for tiny HSI classification. This framework comprises two main parts: (i) a leakage-free balanced sampling strategy, and (ii) a modified end-to-end fully convolutional network (FCN) architecture that optimizes the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The leakage-free balanced sampling strategy generates balanced and non-overlapping training and testing data by partitioning an HSI and the ground truth image into small windows, each of which corresponds to one training or testing sample. The proposed high-efficiency FCN exhibits a pixel-to-pixel architecture with modifications aimed at faster inference speed and improved parameter efficiency. Experiments conducted on four representative datasets demonstrated that the proposed sampling strategy can provide objective performance evaluation and that the proposed network outperformed many state-of-the-art approaches with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff.

{"title":"Why People Skip Music? On Predicting Music Skips using Deep Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Music recommender systems are an integral part of our daily life. Recent research has seen a significant effort around black-box recommender based approaches such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These advances have led, together with the increasing concerns around users' data collection and privacy, to a strong interest in building responsible recommender systems. A key element of a successful music recommender system is modelling how users interact with streamed content. By first understanding these interactions, insights can be drawn to enable the construction of more transparent and responsible systems. An example of these interactions is skipping behaviour, a signal that can measure users' satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or lack of interest. In this paper, we study the utility of users' historical data for the task of sequentially predicting users' skipping behaviour. To this end, we adapt DRL for this classification task, followed by a post-hoc explainability (SHAP) and ablation analysis of the input state representation. Experimental results from a real-world music streaming dataset (Spotify) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in this task by outperforming state-of-the-art models. A comprehensive analysis of our approach and of users' historical data reveals a temporal data leakage problem in the dataset. Our findings indicate that, overall, users' behaviour features are the most discriminative in how our proposed DRL model predicts music skips. Content and contextual features have a lesser effect. This suggests that a limited amount of user data should be collected and leveraged to predict skipping behaviour.","created":"2023-01-10","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03881v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Transceiver Cooperative Learning-aided Semantic Communications Against Mismatched Background Knowledge Bases","abstract":"Semantic communications learned on background knowledge bases (KBs) have been identified as a promising technology for communications between intelligent agents. Existing works assume that transceivers of semantic communications share the same KB. However, intelligent transceivers may suffer from the communication burden or worry about privacy leakage to exchange data in KBs. Besides, the transceivers may independently learn from the environment and dynamically update their KBs, leading to timely sharing of the KBs infeasible. All these cause the mismatch between the KBs, which may result in a semantic-level misunderstanding on the receiver side. To address this issue, we propose a transceiver cooperative learning-assisted semantic communication (TCL-SC) scheme against mismatched KBs. In TCL-SC, the transceivers cooperatively train semantic encoder and decoder neuron networks (NNs) of the same structure based on their own KBs. They periodically share the parameters of NNs. To reduce the communication overhead of parameter sharing, parameter quantization is adopted. Moreover, we discuss the impacts of the number of communication rounds on the performance of semantic communication systems. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our proposed TCL-SC can reduce the semantic-level misunderstanding on the receiver side caused by the mismatch between the KBs, especially at the low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio regime.","created":"2023-01-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03133v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

The measured I(HeII4686)/I(Hbeta) ratio varies from 0.004 to 0.07, with a mean value of 0.010+/-0.003. Ten of these 32 HII regions are coincident with the location of an Ultra Luminous X-ray (ULX) source. We used the flux ratios of important diagnostic lines and results of photoionization by Simple Stellar Populations (SSPs) to investigate the likely physical mechanisms responsible for the ionization of He+. We find that the majority of the regions (27) are consistent with photoionization by star clusters in their Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase with initial ionization parameter -3.5<logU<-2.0. Blue Bump (BB), the characteristic feature of the WR stars, however, is not detected in any of the spectra. We demonstrate that this non-detection is due to the relatively low equivalent width (EW) of the BB in metal-poor SSPs, in spite of containing sufficient number of WR stars to reproduce the observed I(HeII4686)/I(Hbeta) ratio of 1.5% at the Cartwheel metallicity of Z=0.004. The HII regions in the WR phase that are coincident with a ULX source do not show line ratios characteristic of ionization by X-ray sources. However, the ULX sources may have a role to play in the ionization of He+ in two (#99, 144) of the five regions that are not in the WR phase. Ionization by radiative shocks along with the presence of channels for the selective leakage of ionizing photons are the likely scenarios in #17 and #148, the two regions with the highest observed I(HeII4686)/I(Hbeta) ratio.","created":"2023-01-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03073v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Characterization of a half-wave plate for CMB circular polarization measurement with POLARBEAR","abstract":"A half-wave plate (HWP) is often used as a modulator to suppress systematic error in the measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. An HWP can also be used to measure circular polarization (CP) through its optical leakage from CP to linear polarization. The CP of the CMB is predicted to be produced by interactions in the Universe, such as interactions with supernova remnants of population III stars. Thus, the observation of the CP of CMB is a new tool for searching for population III stars. In this paper, we demonstrate the improved measurement of the leakage coefficient using the transmission spectrum measurement of an actual HWP in the laboratory. We measured the transmittance of linearly polarized light through the HWP used in the \\textsc{Polarbear} experiment in the frequency range of \\SIrange{120}{160}{GHz}. We evaluate properties of the HWP by fitting the data with a physical model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We then estimate the band-averaged CP leakage coefficient using the physical model. We find that the leakage coefficient strongly depends on the spectra of CP sources. We thus calculate the maximum rate of leakage from CP to linear polarization as $0.133 \\pm 0.009$ in the Rayleigh--Jeans spectrum. The nonzero value shows that \\textsc{Polarbear} would have sensitivity to the CP. Additionally, because we use the bandpass of detectors installed in the telescope to calculate the band-averaged values, we also consider systematic effects in the experiment.","created":"2023-01-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01983v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"PMP: Privacy-Aware Matrix Profile against Sensitive Pattern Inference for Time Series","abstract":"Recent rapid development of sensor technology has allowed massive fine-grained time series (TS) data to be collected and set the foundation for the development of data-driven services and applications. During the process, data sharing is often involved to allow the third-party modelers to perform specific time series data mining (TSDM) tasks based on the need of data owner. The high resolution of TS brings new challenges in protecting privacy. While meaningful information in high-resolution TS shifts from concrete point values to local shape-based segments, numerous research have found that long shape-based patterns could contain more sensitive information and may potentially be extracted and misused by a malicious third party. However, the privacy issue for TS patterns is surprisingly seldom explored in privacy-preserving literature. In this work, we consider a new privacy-preserving problem: preventing malicious inference on long shape-based patterns while preserving short segment information for the utility task performance. To mitigate the challenge, we investigate an alternative approach by sharing Matrix Profile (MP), which is a non-linear transformation of original data and a versatile data structure that supports many data mining tasks. We found that while MP can prevent concrete shape leakage, the canonical correlation in MP index can still reveal the location of sensitive long pattern. Based on this observation, we design two attacks named Location Attack and Entropy Attack to extract the pattern location from MP. To further protect MP from these two attacks, we propose a Privacy-Aware Matrix Profile (PMP) via perturbing the local correlation and breaking the canonical correlation in MP index vector. We evaluate our proposed PMP against baseline noise-adding methods through quantitative analysis and real-world case studies to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","created":"2023-01-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01838v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"One-Time Universal Hashing Quantum Digital Signatures without Perfect Keys","abstract":"Quantum digital signatures (QDS), generating correlated bit strings among three remote parties for signatures through quantum law, can guarantee non-repudiation, authenticity, and integrity of messages. Recently, one-time universal hashing QDS framework, exploiting the quantum asymmetric encryption and universal hash functions, has been proposed to significantly improve the signature rate and ensure unconditional security by directly signing the hash value of long messages. However, similar to quantum key distribution, this framework utilizes keys with perfect secrecy by performing privacy amplification that introduces cumbersome matrix operations, thereby consuming large computational resources, causing delays and increasing failure probability. Here, we prove that, different from private communication, imperfect quantum keys with limited information leakage can be used for digital signatures and authentication without compromising the security while having eight orders of magnitude improvement on signature rate for signing a megabit message compared with conventional single-bit schemes. This study significantly reduces the delay for data postprocessing and is compatible with any quantum key generation protocols. In our simulation, taking two-photon twin-field key generation protocol as an example, QDS can be practically implemented over a fiber distance of 650 km between the signer and receiver. For the first time, this study offers a cryptographic application of quantum keys with imperfect secrecy and paves a way for the practical and agile implementation of digital signatures in a future quantum network.","created":"2023-01-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01132v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Packing Privacy Budget Efficiently","abstract":"Machine learning (ML) models can leak information about users, and differential privacy (DP) provides a rigorous way to bound that leakage under a given budget. This DP budget can be regarded as a new type of compute resource in workloads of multiple ML models training on user data. Once it is used, the DP budget is forever consumed. Therefore, it is crucial to allocate it most efficiently to train as many models as possible. This paper presents the scheduler for privacy that optimizes for efficiency. We formulate privacy scheduling as a new type of multidimensional knapsack problem, called privacy knapsack, which maximizes DP budget efficiency. We show that privacy knapsack is NP-hard, hence practical algorithms are necessarily approximate. We develop an approximation algorithm for privacy knapsack, DPK, and evaluate it on microbenchmarks and on a new, synthetic private-ML workload we developed from the Alibaba ML cluster trace. We show that DPK: (1) often approaches the efficiency-optimal schedule, (2) consistently schedules more tasks compared to a state-of-the-art privacy scheduling algorithm that focused on fairness (1.3-1.7x in Alibaba, 1.0-2.6x in microbenchmarks), but (3) sacrifices some level of fairness for efficiency. Therefore, using DPK, DP ML operators should be able to train more models on the same amount of user data while offering the same privacy guarantee to their users.","created":"2022-12-26","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13228v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Social-Aware Clustered Federated Learning with Customized Privacy Preservation","abstract":"A key feature of federated learning (FL) is to preserve the data privacy of end users. However, there still exist potential privacy leakage in exchanging gradients under FL. As a result, recent research often explores the differential privacy (DP) approaches to add noises to the computing results to address privacy concerns with low overheads, which however degrade the model performance. In this paper, we strike the balance of data privacy and efficiency by utilizing the pervasive social connections between users. Specifically, we propose SCFL, a novel Social-aware Clustered Federated Learning scheme, where mutually trusted individuals can freely form a social cluster and aggregate their raw model updates (e.g., gradients) inside each cluster before uploading to the cloud for global aggregation. By mixing model updates in a social group, adversaries can only eavesdrop the social-layer combined results, but not the privacy of individuals. We unfold the design of SCFL in three steps. \\emph{i) Stable social cluster formation. Considering users' heterogeneous training samples and data distributions, we formulate the optimal social cluster formation problem as a federation game and devise a fair revenue allocation mechanism to resist free-riders. ii) Differentiated trust-privacy mapping}. For the clusters with low mutual trust, we design a customizable privacy preservation mechanism to adaptively sanitize participants' model updates depending on social trust degrees. iii) Distributed convergence}. A distributed two-sided matching algorithm is devised to attain an optimized disjoint partition with Nash-stable convergence.

{"title":"On the Privacy-Utility Trade-off With and Without Direct Access to the Private Data","abstract":"We study an information theoretic privacy mechanism design problem for two scenarios where the private data is either observable or hidden. In each scenario, we first consider bounded mutual information as privacy leakage criterion, then we use two different per-letter privacy constraints. In the first scenario, an agent observes useful data $Y$ that is correlated with private data $X$, and wishes to disclose the useful information to a user. A privacy mechanism is designed to generate disclosed data $U$ which maximizes the revealed information about $Y$ while satisfying a bounded privacy leakage constraint. In the second scenario, the agent has additionally access to the private data. To this end, we first extend the Functional Representation Lemma and Strong Functional Representation Lemma by relaxing the independence condition and thereby allowing a certain leakage to find lower bounds for the second scenario with different privacy leakage constraints. Furthermore, upper and lower bounds are derived in the first scenario considering different privacy constraints. In particular, for the case where no leakage is allowed, our upper and lower bounds improve previous bounds. Moreover, considering bounded mutual information as privacy constraint we show that if the common information and mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ are equal, then the attained upper bound in the second scenario is tight. Finally, the privacy-utility trade-off with prioritized private data is studied where part of $X$, i.e., $X_1$, is more private than the remaining part, i.e., $X_2$, and we provide lower and upper bounds.","created":"2022-12-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12475v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Secure Aggregation of Semi-Honest Clients and Servers in Federated Learning with Secret-Shared Homomorphism","abstract":"Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning has been recognized as one of the most promising paradigms for the collaboration of multiple or many clients who cannot disclose their local data -- neither the training data set nor the model parameters. One popular approach to preserving the confidentiality of local data is homomorphic encryption (HE): the clients send encrypted model parameters to the server, which aggregates the models into a global model and broadcasts it to the clients. Evidently, the security of the above HE-based approach depends on the assumption that the clients are honest and cannot obtain the encrypted models from others (otherwise the models can be immediately decrypted because all clients share the same private key); this is indeed the case since the encrypted models are transmitted through protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS). However, it is often overlooked that the leakage of encrypted models does not necessarily happen on the network channel; for example, if a semi-honest client colludes with a semi-honest server (the former having the private key and the latter having the ciphertext), possibly offline in another session, they can surely recover the model parameters in question. This paper presents a new protocol for secure aggregation under the mild, in our opinion more practical, assumption that all parties are semi-honest. As a starting point, we construct a new security primitive, called \\textit{asymmetric threshold secret sharing} (ATSS), which works with homomorphic encryption to constitute an aggregation protocol to achieve the desired security. We demonstrate that the ATSS-based protocol is provably secure and delivers reasonable performance in practice.","created":"2022-12-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11394v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Learned Systems Security","abstract":"A learned system uses machine learning (ML) internally to improve performance. We can expect such systems to be vulnerable to some adversarial-ML attacks. Often, the learned component is shared between mutually-distrusting users or processes, much like microarchitectural resources such as caches, potentially giving rise to highly-realistic attacker models. However, compared to attacks on other ML-based systems, attackers face a level of indirection as they cannot interact directly with the learned model. Additionally, the difference between the attack surface of learned and non-learned versions of the same system is often subtle. These factors obfuscate the de-facto risks that the incorporation of ML carries. We analyze the root causes of potentially-increased attack surface in learned systems and develop a framework for identifying vulnerabilities that stem from the use of ML. We apply our framework to a broad set of learned systems under active development. To empirically validate the many vulnerabilities surfaced by our framework, we choose 3 of them and implement and evaluate exploits against prominent learned-system instances. We show that the use of ML caused leakage of past queries in a database, enabled a poisoning attack that causes exponential memory blowup in an index structure and crashes it in seconds, and enabled index users to snoop on each others' key distributions by timing queries over their own keys. We find that adversarial ML is a universal threat against learned systems, point to open research gaps in our understanding of learned-systems security, and conclude by discussing mitigations, while noting that data leakage is inherent in systems whose learned component is shared between multiple parties.","created":"2022-12-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10318v3","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Increasing Physical Layer Security through Hyperchaos in VLC Systems","abstract":"Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems have relatively higher security compared with traditional Radio Frequency (RF) channels due to line-of-sight (LOS) propagation. However, they still are susceptible to eavesdropping. The proposed solution of the papers have been built on existing work on hyperchaos-based security measure to increase physical layer security from eavesdroppers. A fourth-order Henon map is used to scramble the constellation diagrams of the transmitted signals. The scramblers change the constellation symbol of the system using a key. That key on the receiver side de-scrambles the received data. The presented modulation scheme takes advantage of a higher degree of the map to isolate the data transmission to a single dimension, allowing for better scrambling and synchronization. A sliding mode controller is used at the receiver in a master-slave configuration for projective synchronization of the two Henon maps, which helps de-scramble the received data. The data is only isolated for the users aware of the key for synchronization, providing security against eavesdroppers. The proposed VLC system is compared against various existing approaches based on various metrics. An improved Bit Error Rate and a lower information leakage are achieved for a variety of modulation schemes at an acceptable Signal-to-Noise Ratio.","created":"2022-12-17","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08927v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel knowledge distillation method, swing distillation, which can effectively protect the private information of the teacher model from flowing to the student model. In our framework, the temperature coefficient is dynamically and adaptively adjusted according to the degree of private information contained in the data, rather than a predefined constant hyperparameter. It assigns different temperatures to tokens according to the likelihood that a token in a position contains private information. In addition, we inject noise into soft targets provided to the student model, in order to avoid unshielded knowledge transfer. Experiments on multiple datasets and tasks demonstrate that the proposed swing distillation can significantly reduce (by over 80% in terms of canary exposure) the risk of privacy leakage in comparison to KD with competitive or better performance. Furthermore, swing distillation is robust against the increasing privacy budget.","created":"2022-12-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08349v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Deep leakage from gradients","abstract":"With the development of artificial intelligence technology, Federated Learning (FL) model has been widely used in many industries for its high efficiency and confidentiality. Some researchers have explored its confidentiality and designed some algorithms to attack training data sets, but these algorithms all have their own limitations. Therefore, most people still believe that local machine learning gradient information is safe and reliable. In this paper, an algorithm based on gradient features is designed to attack the federated learning model in order to attract more attention to the security of federated learning systems. In federated learning system, gradient contains little information compared with the original training data set, but this project intends to restore the original training image data through gradient information. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has excellent performance in image processing. Therefore, the federated learning model of this project is equipped with Convolutional Neural Network structure, and the model is trained by using image data sets. The algorithm calculates the virtual gradient by generating virtual image labels. Then the virtual gradient is matched with the real gradient to restore the original image. This attack algorithm is written in Python language, uses cat and dog classification Kaggle data sets, and gradually extends from the full connection layer to the convolution layer, thus improving the universality. At present, the average squared error between the data recovered by this algorithm and the original image information is approximately 5, and the vast majority of images can be completely restored according to the gradient information given, indicating that the gradient of federated learning system is not absolutely safe and reliable.","created":"2022-12-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02621v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, if the privacy of machine learning applications' customers cannot be guaranteed, it will cause security threats and losses to users' personal privacy information and service providers. Therefore, the issue of privacy protection of machine learning has received wide attention. For centralized machine learning models, we evaluate the impact of different neural network layers, gradient, gradient norm, and fine-tuned models on member inference attack performance with prior knowledge; For the federated learning model, we discuss the location of the attacker in the target model and its attack mode. The results show that the centralized machine learning model shows more serious member information leakage in all aspects, and the accuracy of the attacker in the central parameter server is significantly higher than the local Inference attacks as participants.","created":"2022-12-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03595v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Most previous approaches rely on data with style labels, but manually-annotated labels are expensive and not always reliable. In response to this problem, we propose Style-Label-Free, a cross-speaker style transfer method, which can realize the style transfer from source speaker to target speaker without style labels. Firstly, a reference encoder structure based on quantized variational autoencoder (Q-VAE) and style bottleneck is designed to extract discrete style representations. Secondly, a speaker-wise batch normalization layer is proposed to reduce the source speaker leakage. In order to improve the style extraction ability of the reference encoder, a style invariant and contrastive data augmentation method is proposed.

{"title":"Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Learning through Feature Extraction","abstract":"We propose a framework in which multiple entities collaborate to build a machine learning model while preserving privacy of their data. The approach utilizes feature embeddings from shared/per-entity feature extractors transforming data into a feature space for cooperation between entities. We propose two specific methods and compare them with a baseline method. In Shared Feature Extractor (SFE) Learning, the entities use a shared feature extractor to compute feature embeddings of samples. In Locally Trained Feature Extractor (LTFE) Learning, each entity uses a separate feature extractor and models are trained using concatenated features from all entities. As a baseline, in Cooperatively Trained Feature Extractor (CTFE) Learning, the entities train models by sharing raw data. Secure multi-party algorithms are utilized to train models without revealing data or features in plain text. We investigate the trade-offs among SFE, LTFE, and CTFE in regard to performance, privacy leakage (using an off-the-shelf membership inference attack), and computational cost. LTFE provides the most privacy, followed by SFE, and then CTFE. Computational cost is lowest for SFE and the relative speed of CTFE and LTFE depends on network architecture. CTFE and LTFE provide the best accuracy.

{"title":"Data Leakage via Access Patterns of Sparse Features in Deep Learning-based Recommendation Systems","abstract":"Online personalized recommendation services are generally hosted in the cloud where users query the cloud-based model to receive recommended input such as merchandise of interest or news feed. State-of-the-art recommendation models rely on sparse and dense features to represent users' profile information and the items they interact with. Although sparse features account for 99% of the total model size, there was not enough attention paid to the potential information leakage through sparse features. These sparse features are employed to track users' behavior, e.g., their click history, object interactions, etc., potentially carrying each user's private information. Sparse features are represented as learned embedding vectors that are stored in large tables, and personalized recommendation is performed by using a specific user's sparse feature to index through the tables. Even with recently-proposed methods that hides the computation happening in the cloud, an attacker in the cloud may be able to still track the access patterns to the embedding tables. This paper explores the private information that may be learned by tracking a recommendation model's sparse feature access patterns. We first characterize the types of attacks that can be carried out on sparse features in recommendation models in an untrusted cloud, followed by a demonstration of how each of these attacks leads to extracting users' private information or tracking users by their behavior over time.","created":"2022-12-12","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06264v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"A Bargaining Game for Personalized, Energy Efficient Split Learning over Wireless Networks","abstract":"Split learning (SL) is an emergent distributed learning framework which can mitigate the computation and wireless communication overhead of federated learning. It splits a machine learning model into a device-side model and a server-side model at a cut layer. Devices only train their allocated model and transmit the activations of the cut layer to the server. However, SL can lead to data leakage as the server can reconstruct the input data using the correlation between the input and intermediate activations. Although allocating more layers to a device-side model can reduce the possibility of data leakage, this will lead to more energy consumption for resource-constrained devices and more training time for the server. Moreover, non-iid datasets across devices will reduce the convergence rate leading to increased training time. In this paper, a new personalized SL framework is proposed. For this framework, a novel approach for choosing the cut layer that can optimize the tradeoff between the energy consumption for computation and wireless transmission, training time, and data privacy is developed. In the considered framework, each device personalizes its device-side model to mitigate non-iid datasets while sharing the same server-side model for generalization. To balance the energy consumption for computation and wireless transmission, training time, and data privacy, a multiplayer bargaining problem is formulated to find the optimal cut layer between devices and the server. To solve the problem, the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution (KSBS) is obtained using the bisection method with the feasibility test. Simulation results show that the proposed personalized SL framework with the cut layer from the KSBS can achieve the optimal sum utilities by balancing the energy consumption, training time, and data privacy, and it is also robust to non-iid datasets.","created":"2022-12-12","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06107v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Eliminating Leakage in Volatile Memory with Anti-Ferroelectric Transistors","abstract":"Cache serves as a temporary data memory module in many general-purpose processors and domain-specific accelerators. Its density, power, speed, and reliability play a critical role in enhancing the overall system performance and quality of service. Conventional volatile memories, including static random-access memory (SRAM) and embedded dynamic random-access memory (eDRAM) in the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, have high performance and good reliability. However, the inherent leakage in both SRAM and eDRAM hinders further improvement towards smaller feature sizes and higher energy efficiency. Although the emerging nonvolatile memories can eliminate the leakage efficiently, the penalties of lower speed and degraded reliability are significant. This article reveals a new opportunity towards leakage-free volatile static memory beyond the known paradigms of existing volatile and nonvolatile memories. By engineering a double-well energy landscape with the assistance of a clamping voltage bias, leakage-free and refresh-free state retention of volatile memory is achieved for the first time. This new memory is highlighted by both the ultra-low leakage of nonvolatile memories and the speed, energy, and reliability advantages of volatile memories. A proof-of-concept memory is demonstrated using in-house anti-ferroelectric field-effect transistors (AFeFETs), delivering an extrapolated endurance of about 1012 cycles, a retention time of over 10 years, and no subthreshold channel leakage current. Such a new concept of AFeFET-based memory enables an improved balance between density, power, and reliability beyond all existing memory solutions.","created":"2022-12-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04973v4","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Skellam Mixture Mechanism: a Novel Approach to Federated Learning with Differential Privacy","abstract":"Deep neural networks have strong capabilities of memorizing the underlying training data, which can be a serious privacy concern. An effective solution to this problem is to train models with differential privacy, which provides rigorous privacy guarantees by injecting random noise to the gradients. This paper focuses on the scenario where sensitive data are distributed among multiple participants, who jointly train a model through federated learning (FL), using both secure multiparty computation (MPC) to ensure the confidentiality of each gradient update, and differential privacy to avoid data leakage in the resulting model. A major challenge in this setting is that common mechanisms for enforcing DP in deep learning, which inject real-valued noise, are fundamentally incompatible with MPC, which exchanges finite-field integers among the participants. Consequently, most existing DP mechanisms require rather high noise levels, leading to poor model utility. Motivated by this, we propose Skellam mixture mechanism (SMM), an approach to enforce DP on models built via FL. Compared to existing methods, SMM eliminates the assumption that the input gradients must be integer-valued, and, thus, reduces the amount of noise injected to preserve DP. Further, SMM allows tight privacy accounting due to the nice composition and sub-sampling properties of the Skellam distribution, which are key to accurate deep learning with DP. The theoretical analysis of SMM is highly non-trivial, especially considering (i) the complicated math of differentially private deep learning in general and (ii) the fact that the mixture of two Skellam distributions is rather complex, and to our knowledge, has not been studied in the DP literature. Extensive experiments on various practical settings demonstrate that SMM consistently and significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of the utility of the resulting model.","created":"2022-12-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04371v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"MOB-FL: Mobility-Aware Federated Learning for Intelligent Connected Vehicles","abstract":"Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable the future Internet of vehicles consisting of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) with powerful sensing, computing and communication capabilities. We consider a base station (BS) coordinating nearby ICVs to train a neural network in a collaborative yet distributed manner, in order to limit data traffic and privacy leakage. However, due to the mobility of vehicles, the connections between the BS and ICVs are short-lived, which affects the resource utilization of ICVs, and thus, the convergence speed of the training process. In this paper, we propose an accelerated FL-ICV framework, by optimizing the duration of each training round and the number of local iterations, for better convergence performance of FL. We propose a mobility-aware optimization algorithm called MOB-FL, which aims at maximizing the resource utilization of ICVs under short-lived wireless connections, so as to increase the convergence speed. Simulation results based on the beam selection and the trajectory prediction tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution.","created":"2022-12-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03519v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Non-interactive Multi-client Searchable Symmetric Encryption with Small Client Storage","abstract":"Considerable attention has been paid to dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE) which allows users to search on dynamically updated encrypted databases. To improve the performance of real-world applications, recent non-interactive multi-client DSSE schemes are targeted at avoiding per-query interaction between data owners and data users. However, existing non-interactive multi-client DSSE schemes do not consider forward privacy or backward privacy, making them exposed to leakage abuse attacks. Besides, most existing DSSE schemes with forward and backward privacy rely on keeping a keyword operation counter or an inverted index, resulting in a heavy storage burden on the data owner side. To address these issues, we propose a non-interactive multi-client DSSE scheme with small client storage, and our proposed scheme can provide both forward privacy and backward privacy. Specifically, we first design a lightweight storage chain structure that binds all keywords to a single state to reduce the storage cost. Then, we present a Hidden Key technique, which preserves non-interactive forward privacy through time range queries, ensuring that data with newer timestamps cannot match earlier time ranges. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our methods, which demonstrate computational efficiency. Moreover, security analysis proves the privacy-preserving property of our methods.","created":"2022-12-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02859v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"On the Discredibility of Membership Inference Attacks","abstract":"With the wide-spread application of machine learning models, it has become critical to study the potential data leakage of models trained on sensitive data. Recently, various membership inference (MI) attacks are proposed that determines if a sample was part of the training set or not. Although the first generation of MI attacks has been proven to be ineffective in practice, a few recent studies proposed practical MI attacks that achieve reasonable true positive rate at low false positive rate. The question is whether these attacks can be reliably used in practice. We showcase a practical application of membership inference attacks where it is used by an auditor (investigator) to prove to a judge/jury that an auditee unlawfully used sensitive data during training. Then, we show that the auditee can provide a dataset (with potentially unlimited number of samples) to a judge where MI attacks catastrophically fail. Hence, the auditee challenges the credibility of the auditor and can get the case dismissed. More importantly, we show that the auditee does not need to know anything about the MI attack neither a query access to it. In other words, all currently SOTA MI attacks in literature suffer from the same issue. Through comprehensive experimental evaluation, we show that our algorithms can increase the false positive rate from ten to thousands times larger than what auditor claim to the judge. Lastly, we argue that the implication of our algorithms is beyond discredibility: Current membership inference attacks can identify the memorized subpopulations, but they cannot reliably identify which exact sample in the subpopulation was used during training.","created":"2022-12-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02701v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Refiner: Data Refining against Gradient Leakage Attacks in Federated Learning","abstract":"Federated Learning (FL) is pervasive in privacy-focused IoT environments since it enables avoiding privacy leakage by training models with gradients instead of data. Recent works show the uploaded gradients can be employed to reconstruct data, i.e., gradient leakage attacks, and several defenses are designed to alleviate the risk by tweaking the gradients. However, these defenses exhibit weak resilience against threatening attacks, as the effectiveness builds upon the unrealistic assumptions that deep neural networks are simplified as linear models. In this paper, without such unrealistic assumptions, we present a novel defense, called Refiner, instead of perturbing gradients, which refines ground-truth data to craft robust data that yields sufficient utility but with the least amount of privacy information, and then the gradients of robust data are uploaded. To craft robust data, Refiner promotes the gradients of critical parameters associated with robust data to close ground-truth ones while leaving the gradients of trivial parameters to safeguard privacy. Moreover, to exploit the gradients of trivial parameters, Refiner utilizes a well-designed evaluation network to steer robust data far away from ground-truth data, thereby alleviating privacy leakage risk. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior defense effectiveness of Refiner at defending against state-of-the-art threats.","created":"2022-12-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02042v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"PGFed: Personalize Each Client's Global Objective for Federated Learning","abstract":"The mediocre performance of conventional federated learning (FL) over heterogeneous data has been facilitating personalized FL solutions, where, unlike conventional FL which trains a single global consensus model, different models are allowed for different clients. However, in most existing personalized FL algorithms, the collaborative knowledge across the federation was only implicitly passed to the clients in ways such as model aggregation or regularization. We observed that this implicit knowledge transfer fails to maximize the potential value of each client's empirical risk toward other clients. Based on our observation, in this work, we propose Personalized Global Federated Learning (PGFed), a novel personalized FL framework that enables each client to personalize its own global objective by explicitly and adaptively aggregating the empirical risks of itself and other clients. To avoid massive ($O(N^2)$) communication overhead and potential privacy leakage, each client's risk is estimated through a first-order approximation for other clients' adaptive risk aggregation. On top of PGFed, we develop a momentum upgrade, dubbed PGFedMo, to more efficiently utilize clients' empirical risks. Our extensive experiments under different federated settings with benchmark datasets show consistent improvements of PGFed over the compared state-of-the-art alternatives.","created":"2022-12-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01448v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"All You Need Is Hashing: Defending Against Data Reconstruction Attack in Vertical Federated Learning","abstract":"Vertical federated learning is a trending solution for multi-party collaboration in training machine learning models. Industrial frameworks adopt secure multi-party computation methods such as homomorphic encryption to guarantee data security and privacy. However, a line of work has revealed that there are still leakage risks in VFL. The leakage is caused by the correlation between the intermediate representations and the raw data. Due to the powerful approximation ability of deep neural networks, an adversary can capture the correlation precisely and reconstruct the data. To deal with the threat of the data reconstruction attack, we propose a hashing-based VFL framework, called \\textit{HashVFL}, to cut off the reversibility directly. The one-way nature of hashing allows our framework to block all attempts to recover data from hash codes. However, integrating hashing also brings some challenges, e.g., the loss of information. This paper proposes and addresses three challenges to integrating hashing: learnability, bit balance, and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate \\textit{HashVFL}'s efficiency in keeping the main task's performance and defending against data reconstruction attacks. Furthermore, we also analyze its potential value in detecting abnormal inputs. In addition, we conduct extensive experiments to prove \\textit{HashVFL}'s generalization in various settings. In summary, \\textit{HashVFL} provides a new perspective on protecting multi-party's data security and privacy in VFL. We hope our study can attract more researchers to expand the application domains of \\textit{HashVFL}.","created":"2022-12-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00325v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Decentralized Matrix Factorization with Heterogeneous Differential Privacy","abstract":"Conventional matrix factorization relies on centralized collection of users' data for recommendation, which might introduce an increased risk of privacy leakage especially when the recommender is untrusted. Existing differentially private matrix factorization methods either assume the recommender is trusted, or can only provide a uniform level of privacy protection for all users and items with untrusted recommender. In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Differentially Private Matrix Factorization algorithm (denoted as HDPMF) for untrusted recommender. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve heterogeneous differential privacy for decentralized matrix factorization in untrusted recommender scenario. Specifically, our framework uses modified stretching mechanism with an innovative rescaling scheme to achieve better trade off between privacy and accuracy. Meanwhile, by allocating privacy budget properly, we can capture homogeneous privacy preference within a user/item but heterogeneous privacy preference across different users/items.

{"title":"Split Learning without Local Weight Sharing to Enhance Client-side Data Privacy","abstract":"Split learning (SL) aims to protect user data privacy by splitting deep models between client-server and keeping private data locally. SL has been demonstrated to achieve similar accuracy as the centralized learning model. In SL with multiple clients, the local training weights are shared between clients for local model aggregation. This paper investigates the potential of data leakage due to local weight sharing among the clients in SL by performing model inversion attacks. To mitigate the identified leakage issue, we propose and analyze privacy-enhancement SL (P-SL), e.g., SL without local weight sharing, to boost client-side data privacy. We also propose paralleled P-SL to speed up the training process by employing multiple servers without accuracy reduction. Finally, we investigate P-SL with late participating clients and develop a server-based cache-based training to address the forgetting phenomenon in SL. Experimental results demonstrate that P-SL helps reduce up to 50% of client-side data leakage compared to SL. Moreover, P-SL and its cache-based version achieve comparable accuracy to SL under various data distributions with lower computation and communications costs. Also, caching in P-SL reduces the negative effect of forgetting, stabilizes the learning, and enables effective and low-complexity training in a dynamic environment with late-arriving clients.","created":"2022-12-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00250v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Wireless Image Transmission with Semantic and Security Awareness","abstract":"Semantic communication is an increasingly popular framework for wireless image transmission due to its high communication efficiency. With the aid of the joint-source-and-channel (JSC) encoder implemented by neural network, semantic communication directly maps original images into symbol sequences containing semantic information. Compared with the traditional separate source and channel coding design used in bitlevel communication systems, semantic communication systems are known to be more efficient and accurate especially in the low signal-to-the-noise ratio (SNR) regime. This thus prompts an critical while yet to be tackled issue of security in semantic communication: it makes the eavesdropper more easier to crack the semantic information as it can be decoded even in a quite noisy channel. In this letter, we develop a semantic communication framework that accounts for both semantic meaning decoding efficiency and its risk of privacy leakage. To achieve this, targeting wireless image transmission, we on the one hand propose an JSC autoencoder featuring residual for efficient semantic meaning extraction and transmission, and on the other hand, propose a data-driven scheme that balances the efficiency-privacy tradeoff.

Therefore, DeFi protocols could hardly offer different users customized solutions, and the capital utilization is limited. To address this challenge in DeFi, we propose a solution, which is a trustful protocol that allows users to provide personal private data to DeFi protocols without worrying that such information would be disclosed. By implementing asymmetric encryption, zero-knowledge proof, and homomorphic encryption, we ensure that users' data will not be controlled by any centralized authorities and avoid potential financial losses or legal disputes due to information leakage. We further discuss the application scenarios of financial data privacy protection in public blockchain DeFi ecosystems and cross-border financial applications, such as credit aggregation.","created":"2022-11-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16082v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Abstract Interpretation-Based Data Leakage Static Analysis","abstract":"Data leakage is a well-known problem in machine learning. Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create a model. This phenomenon renders a model excessively optimistic or even useless in the real world since the model tends to leverage greatly on the unfairly acquired information. To date, detection of data leakages occurs post-mortem using run-time methods. However, due to the insidious nature of data leakage, it may not be apparent to a data scientist that a data leakage has occurred in the first place. For this reason, it is advantageous to detect data leakages as early as possible in the development life cycle. In this paper, we propose a novel static analysis to detect several instances of data leakages during development time. We define our analysis using the framework of abstract interpretation: we define a concrete semantics that is sound and complete, from which we derive a sound and computable abstract semantics. We implement our static analysis inside the open-source NBLyzer static analysis framework and demonstrate its utility by evaluating its performance and precision on over 2000 Kaggle competition notebooks.","created":"2022-11-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16073v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this work, an agent observes useful data $Y=(Y_1,...,Y_N)$ that is correlated with private data $X=(X_1,...,X_N)$ which is assumed to be also accessible by the agent. Here, we consider $K$ users where user $i$ demands a sub-vector of $Y$, denoted by $C_{i}$. The agent wishes to disclose $C_{i}$ to user $i$. Since $C_{i}$ is correlated with $X$ it can not be disclosed directly. A privacy mechanism is designed to generate disclosed data $U$ which maximizes a linear combinations of the users utilities while satisfying a bounded privacy constraint in terms of mutual information. In a similar work it has been assumed that $X_i$ is a deterministic function of $Y_i$, however in this work we let $X_i$ and $Y_i$ be arbitrarily correlated. First, an upper bound on the privacy-utility trade-off is obtained by using a specific transformation, Functional Representation Lemma and Strong Functional Representaion Lemma, then we show that the upper bound can be decomposed into $N$ parallel problems. Next, lower bounds on privacy-utility trade-off are derived using Functional Representation Lemma and Strong Functional Representaion Lemma. The upper bound is tight within a constant and the lower bounds assert that the disclosed data is independent of all $\\{X_j\\}_{i=1}^N$ except one which we allocate the maximum allowed leakage to it.

To motivate workers to build a high-quality global model in an efficacy way, we introduce an incentive mechanism that encourages workers to constantly collect fresh data to train accurate client models and boosts the global model training. We model the incentive-based interaction between the crowdsourcing platform and participating workers as a Stackelberg game, in which each side maximizes its own profit. We derive the Nash Equilibrium of the game to find the optimal solutions for the two sides.

However, without human annotations, they are typically prone to produce foreground and background layers with non-negligible semantic and visual confusion, dubbed \"information leakage\", resulting in notable degeneration of the generated segmentation mask. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple-yet-effective explicit layer independence modeling approach, termed Independent Layer Synthesis GAN (ILSGAN), pursuing independent foreground-background layer generation by encouraging their discrepancy. Specifically, it targets minimizing the mutual information between visible and invisible regions of the foreground and background to spur interlayer independence. Through in-depth theoretical and experimental analyses, we justify that explicit layer independence modeling is critical to suppressing information leakage and contributes to impressive segmentation performance gains. Also, our ILSGAN achieves strong state-of-the-art generation quality and segmentation performance on complex real-world data.","created":"2022-11-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13974v3","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Microarchitectural Leakage Templates and Their Application to Cache-Based Side Channels","abstract":"The complexity of modern processor architectures has given rise to sophisticated interactions among their components. Such interactions may result in potential attack vectors in terms of side channels, possibly available to user-land exploits to leak secret data. Exploitation and countering of such side channels require a detailed understanding of the target component. However, such detailed information is commonly unpublished for many CPUs.   In this paper, we introduce the concept of Leakage Templates to abstractly describe specific side channels and identify their occurrences in binary applications. We design and implement Plumber, a framework to derive the generic Leakage Templates from individual code sequences that are known to cause leakage (e.g., found by prior work). Plumber uses a combination of instruction fuzzing, instructions' operand mutation and statistical analysis to explore undocumented behavior of microarchitectural optimizations and derive sufficient conditions on vulnerable code inputs that, if hold can trigger a distinguishing behavior. Using Plumber we identified novel leakage primitives based on Leakage Templates (for ARM Cortex-A53 and -A72 cores), in particular related to previction (a new premature cache eviction), and prefetching behavior. We show the utility of Leakage Templates by re-identifying a prefetcher-based vulnerability in OpenSSL 1.1.0g first reported by Shin et al.

{"title":"Removal of point source leakage from time-order data filtering","abstract":"Time-ordered data (TOD) from ground-based CMB experiments are generally filtered before map-making to remove or reduce the contamination from the ground and the atmospheric emissions. However, when the observation region contains strong point sources, the filtering process will result in considerable leakage around the point sources in a measured CMB map, and leave spurious polarization signals. Therefore, such signals need to be assessed and removed before CMB science exploitation. In this work, we present a new method that we call \"template fitting\" and can effectively remove these leakage signals in pixel domain, not only satisfying the requirement for measuring primordial gravitational waves from CMB-$B$ modes, but also avoiding time-consuming operations on TOD.","created":"2022-11-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13870v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Privacy in Practice: Private COVID-19 Detection in X-Ray Images","abstract":"Machine learning (ML) can help fight pandemics like COVID-19 by enabling rapid screening of large volumes of images. To perform data analysis while maintaining patient privacy, we create ML models that satisfy Differential Privacy (DP). Previous works exploring private COVID-19 models are in part based on small datasets, provide weaker or unclear privacy guarantees, and do not investigate practical privacy. We suggest improvements to address these open gaps. We account for inherent class imbalances and evaluate the utility-privacy trade-off more extensively and over stricter privacy budgets. Our evaluation is supported by empirically estimating practical privacy through black-box Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). The introduced DP should help limit leakage threats posed by MIAs, and our practical analysis is the first to test this hypothesis on the COVID-19 classification task. Our results indicate that needed privacy levels might differ based on the task-dependent practical threat from MIAs. The results further suggest that with increasing DP guarantees, empirical privacy leakage only improves marginally, and DP therefore appears to have a limited impact on practical MIA defense. Our findings identify possibilities for better utility-privacy trade-offs, and we believe that empirical attack-specific privacy estimation can play a vital role in tuning for practical privacy.","created":"2022-11-21","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11434v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Data Leakage and Evaluation Issues in Micro-Expression Analysis","abstract":"Micro-expressions have drawn increasing interest lately due to various potential applications. The task is, however, difficult as it incorporates many challenges from the fields of computer vision, machine learning and emotional sciences. Due to the spontaneous and subtle characteristics of micro-expressions, the available training and testing data are limited, which make evaluation complex. We show that data leakage and fragmented evaluation protocols are issues among the micro-expression literature. We find that fixing data leaks can drastically reduce model performance, in some cases even making the models perform similarly to a random classifier. To this end, we go through common pitfalls, propose a new standardized evaluation protocol using facial action units with over 2000 micro-expression samples, and provide an open source library that implements the evaluation protocols in a standardized manner.

{"title":"A Unified Framework for Quantifying Privacy Risk in Synthetic Data","abstract":"Synthetic data is often presented as a method for sharing sensitive information in a privacy-preserving manner by reproducing the global statistical properties of the original data without disclosing sensitive information about any individual. In practice, as with other anonymization methods, privacy risks cannot be entirely eliminated. The residual privacy risks need instead to be ex-post assessed. We present Anonymeter, a statistical framework to jointly quantify different types of privacy risks in synthetic tabular datasets. We equip this framework with attack-based evaluations for the singling out, linkability, and inference risks, the three key indicators of factual anonymization according to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a coherent and legally aligned evaluation of these three privacy risks for synthetic data, and to design privacy attacks which model directly the singling out and linkability risks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by conducting an extensive set of experiments that measure the privacy risks of data with deliberately inserted privacy leakages, and of synthetic data generated with and without differential privacy. Our results highlight that the three privacy risks reported by our framework scale linearly with the amount of privacy leakage in the data. Furthermore, we observe that synthetic data exhibits the lowest vulnerability against linkability, indicating one-to-one relationships between real and synthetic data records are not preserved. Finally, we demonstrate quantitatively that Anonymeter outperforms existing synthetic data privacy evaluation frameworks both in terms of detecting privacy leaks, as well as computation speed. To contribute to a privacy-conscious usage of synthetic data, we open source Anonymeter at https://github.com/statice/anonymeter.","created":"2022-11-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10459v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Impact of spiking neurons leakages and network recurrences on event-based spatio-temporal pattern recognition","abstract":"Spiking neural networks coupled with neuromorphic hardware and event-based sensors are getting increased interest for low-latency and low-power inference at the edge. However, multiple spiking neuron models have been proposed in the literature with different levels of biological plausibility and different computational features and complexities. Consequently, there is a need to define the right level of abstraction from biology in order to get the best performance in accurate, efficient and fast inference in neuromorphic hardware. In this context, we explore the impact of synaptic and membrane leakages in spiking neurons. We confront three neural models with different computational complexities using feedforward and recurrent topologies for event-based visual and auditory pattern recognition. Our results show that, in terms of accuracy, leakages are important when there are both temporal information in the data and explicit recurrence in the network. In addition, leakages do not necessarily increase the sparsity of spikes flowing in the network. We also investigate the impact of heterogeneity in the time constant of leakages, and the results show a slight improvement in accuracy when using data with a rich temporal structure. These results advance our understanding of the computational role of the neural leakages and network recurrences, and provide valuable insights for the design of compact and energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware for embedded systems.","created":"2022-11-14","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07761v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, almost no existing work has focused on the analysis of compositional data. In this article, we investigate differentially private approaches for analyzing compositional data using the Dirichlet distribution as the statistical model.

{"title":"Heterogeneous Randomized Response for Differential Privacy in Graph Neural Networks","abstract":"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are susceptible to privacy inference attacks (PIAs), given their ability to learn joint representation from features and edges among nodes in graph data. To prevent privacy leakages in GNNs, we propose a novel heterogeneous randomized response (HeteroRR) mechanism to protect nodes' features and edges against PIAs under differential privacy (DP) guarantees without an undue cost of data and model utility in training GNNs. Our idea is to balance the importance and sensitivity of nodes' features and edges in redistributing the privacy budgets since some features and edges are more sensitive or important to the model utility than others. As a result, we derive significantly better randomization probabilities and tighter error bounds at both levels of nodes' features and edges departing from existing approaches, thus enabling us to maintain high data utility for training GNNs. An extensive theoretical and empirical analysis using benchmark datasets shows that HeteroRR significantly outperforms various baselines in terms of model utility under rigorous privacy protection for both nodes' features and edges. That enables us to defend PIAs in DP-preserving GNNs effectively.","created":"2022-11-10","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05766v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Existing studies employ direct modification or text-based re-synthesis to de-identify users' voices, but resulting in inconsistent audibility in the presence of human participants. In this paper, we propose a voice de-identification system, which uses adversarial examples to balance the privacy and utility of voice services. Instead of typical additive examples inducing perceivable distortions, we design a novel convolutional adversarial example that modulates perturbations into real-world room impulse responses. Benefit from this, our system could preserve user identity from exposure by Automatic Speaker Identification (ASI) while remaining the voice perceptual quality for non-intrusive de-identification. Moreover, our system learns a compact speaker distribution through a conditional variational auto-encoder to sample diverse target embeddings on demand. Combining diverse target generation and input-specific perturbation construction, our system enables any-to-any identify transformation for adaptive de-identification. Experimental results show that our system could achieve 98% and 79% successful de-identification on mainstream ASIs and commercial systems with an objective Mel cepstral distortion of 4.31dB and a subjective mean opinion score of 4.48.","created":"2022-11-10","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05446v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

While such recourses can be immensely beneficial to affected individuals, potential adversaries could also exploit these recourses to compromise privacy. In this work, we make the first attempt at investigating if and how an adversary can leverage recourses to infer private information about the underlying model's training data. To this end, we propose a series of novel membership inference attacks which leverage algorithmic recourse. More specifically, we extend the prior literature on membership inference attacks to the recourse setting by leveraging the distances between data instances and their corresponding counterfactuals output by state-of-the-art recourse methods. Extensive experimentation with real world and synthetic datasets demonstrates significant privacy leakage through recourses.

{"title":"Grid-free Harmonic Retrieval and Model Order Selection using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"Harmonic retrieval techniques are the foundation of radio channel sounding, estimation and modeling. This paper introduces a Deep Learning approach for two-dimensional spectral estimation from frequency and time samples of a radio channel transfer function.   Our work can estimate two-dimensional parameters from a signal containing an unknown number of paths. In contrast to existing deep learning-based methods, the signal parameters are not estimated via classification but instead in a quasi-grid-free manner. This alleviates the bias, spectral leakage, and ghost targets that grid-based approaches inherently produce. The proposed architecture also reliably estimates the number of spectral components in the measurement. Hence, the architecture jointly solves the model order selection problem and the parameter estimation task. Additionally, we propose a multi-channel windowing of the data during preprocessing, increasing the resulting estimator's robustness.   We verify the performance compared to existing harmonic retrieval methods and also show how it can be integrated into an existing maximum likelihood estimator for efficient initialization of a gradient-based iteration.","created":"2022-11-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04846v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Overcoming leakage in scalable quantum error correction","abstract":"Leakage of quantum information out of computational states into higher energy states represents a major challenge in the pursuit of quantum error correction (QEC). In a QEC circuit, leakage builds over time and spreads through multi-qubit interactions. This leads to correlated errors that degrade the exponential suppression of logical error with scale, challenging the feasibility of QEC as a path towards fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we demonstrate the execution of a distance-3 surface code and distance-21 bit-flip code on a Sycamore quantum processor where leakage is removed from all qubits in each cycle. This shortens the lifetime of leakage and curtails its ability to spread and induce correlated errors. We report a ten-fold reduction in steady-state leakage population on the data qubits encoding the logical state and an average leakage population of less than $1 \\times 10^{-3}$ throughout the entire device. The leakage removal process itself efficiently returns leakage population back to the computational basis, and adding it to a code circuit prevents leakage from inducing correlated error across cycles, restoring a fundamental assumption of QEC. With this demonstration that leakage can be contained, we resolve a key challenge for practical QEC at scale.","created":"2022-11-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04728v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Efficacy of MRI data harmonization in the age of machine learning. A multicenter study across 36 datasets","abstract":"Pooling publicly-available MRI data from multiple sites allows to assemble extensive groups of subjects, increase statistical power, and promote data reuse with machine learning techniques. The harmonization of multicenter data is necessary to reduce the confounding effect associated with non-biological sources of variability in the data. However, when applied to the entire dataset before machine learning, the harmonization leads to data leakage, because information outside the training set may affect model building, and potentially falsely overestimate performance. We propose a 1) measurement of the efficacy of data harmonization; 2) harmonizer transformer, i.e., an implementation of the ComBat harmonization allowing its encapsulation among the preprocessing steps of a machine learning pipeline, avoiding data leakage. We tested these tools using brain T1-weighted MRI data from 1740 healthy subjects acquired at 36 sites. After harmonization, the site effect was removed or reduced, and we measured the data leakage effect in predicting individual age from MRI data, highlighting that introducing the harmonizer transformer into a machine learning pipeline allows for avoiding data leakage.","created":"2022-11-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04125v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Decentralized data processing over networked terminal nodes becomes an important technology in the era of big data. Dictionary learning is a powerful representation learning method to exploit the low-dimensional structure from the high-dimensional data. By exploiting the low-dimensional structure, the storage and the processing overhead of data can be effectively reduced. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized complete dictionary learning algorithm, which is based on $\\ell^{4}$-norm maximization. Compared with existing decentralized dictionary learning algorithms, comprehensive numerical experiments show that the novel algorithm has significant advantages in terms of per-iteration computational complexity, communication cost, and convergence rate in many scenarios. Moreover, a rigorous theoretical analysis shows that the dictionaries learned by the proposed algorithm can converge to the one learned by a centralized dictionary learning algorithm at a linear rate with high probability under certain conditions.","created":"2022-11-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03628v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Haven't I Seen You Before? Assessing Identity Leakage in Synthetic Irises","abstract":"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to be a preferred method of synthesizing fake images of objects, such as faces, animals, and automobiles. It is not surprising these models can also generate ISO-compliant, yet synthetic iris images, which can be used to augment training data for iris matchers and liveness detectors. In this work, we trained one of the most recent GAN models (StyleGAN3) to generate fake iris images with two primary goals: (i) to understand the GAN's ability to produce \"never-before-seen\" irises, and (ii) to investigate the phenomenon of identity leakage as a function of the GAN's training time. Previous work has shown that personal biometric data can inadvertently flow from training data into synthetic samples, raising a privacy concern for subjects who accidentally appear in the training dataset. This paper presents analysis for three different iris matchers at varying points in the GAN training process to diagnose where and when authentic training samples are in jeopardy of leaking through the generative process. Our results show that while most synthetic samples do not show signs of identity leakage, a handful of generated samples match authentic (training) samples nearly perfectly, with consensus across all matchers. In order to prioritize privacy, security, and trust in the machine learning model development process, the research community must strike a delicate balance between the benefits of using synthetic data and the corresponding threats against privacy from potential identity leakage.","created":"2022-11-03","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05629v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Since optimal mechanisms typically achieve these high success probabilities, our results imply that optimal private mechanisms for many basic statistics problems are robust.   We investigate the consequences of this observation for both algorithms and computational complexity across different statistical problems. Assuming the Brennan-Bresler secret-leakage planted clique conjecture, we demonstrate a fundamental tradeoff between computational efficiency, privacy leakage, and success probability for sparse mean estimation. Private algorithms which match this tradeoff are not yet known -- we achieve that (up to polylogarithmic factors) in a polynomially-large range of parameters via the Sum-of-Squares method.   To establish an information-computation gap for private sparse mean estimation, we also design new (exponential-time) mechanisms using fewer samples than efficient algorithms must use. Finally, we give evidence for privacy-induced information-computation gaps for several other statistics and learning problems, including PAC learning parity functions and estimation of the mean of a multivariate Gaussian.","created":"2022-11-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00724v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

Associating related artifacts is a common practice for effective documentation and maintenance of software projects. Conventionally, to register the link between an issue report and its associated commit, developers manually include the issue identifier in the message of the relevant commit. Research has shown that developers tend to forget to connect said artifacts manually, resulting in a loss of links. Hence, several link recovery techniques were proposed to discover and revive such links automatically. However, the literature mainly focuses on improving the prediction accuracy on a randomly-split test set, while neglecting other important aspects of this problem, including the effect of time and generalizability of the predictive models. In this paper, we propose LinkFormer to address this problem from three aspects; 1) Accuracy: To better utilize contextual information for prediction, we employ the Transformer architecture and fine-tune multiple pre-trained models on textual and metadata of issues and commits. 2) Data leakage: To empirically assess the impact of time through the splitting policy, we train and test our proposed model along with several existing approaches on both randomly- and temporally split data. 3) Generalizability: To provide a generic model that can perform well across different projects, we further fine-tune LinkFormer in two transfer learning settings. We empirically show that researchers should preserve the temporal flow of data when training learning-based models to resemble the real-world setting. In addition, LinkFormer significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by large margins. LinkFormer is also capable of extending the knowledge it learned to unseen projects with little to no historical data.","created":"2022-11-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00381v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Many prior works -- and some recently deployed defenses -- focus on \"verbatim memorization\", defined as a model generation that exactly matches a substring from the training set. We argue that verbatim memorization definitions are too restrictive and fail to capture more subtle forms of memorization. Specifically, we design and implement an efficient defense based on Bloom filters that perfectly prevents all verbatim memorization. And yet, we demonstrate that this \"perfect\" filter does not prevent the leakage of training data. Indeed, it is easily circumvented by plausible and minimally modified \"style-transfer\" prompts -- and in some cases even the non-modified original prompts -- to extract memorized information. For example, instructing the model to output ALL-CAPITAL texts bypasses memorization checks based on verbatim matching. We conclude by discussing potential alternative definitions and why defining memorization is a difficult yet crucial open question for neural language models.","created":"2022-10-31","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17546v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Authentication is regarded as the fundamental defense line against attacks in IoV. However, the state-of-the-art approaches suffer from several drawbacks, including bottlenecks of the single cloud server model, high computational overhead of operations, excessive trust in cloud servers and roadside units (RSUs), and leakage of vehicle trajectory privacy. In this paper, BEPHAP, a Blockchain-based Efficient Privacy-preserving Handover Authentication Protocol with key agreement for internet of vehicles, is introduced to address these problems. BEPHAP achieves anonymous cross-domain mutual handover authentication with key agreement based on the tamper-proof blockchain, symmetric cryptography, and the chameleon hash function under a security model that cloud servers and RSUs may launch attacks. BEPHAP is particularly well suited for IoV since it allows vehicles only need to perform lightweight cryptographic operations during the authentication phase. BEPHAP also achieves data confidentiality, unlinkability, traceability, non-repudiation, non-frameability, and key escrow freeness. Formal verification based on ProVerif and formal security proofs based on the BAN logic indicates that BEPHAP is resistant to various typical attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, impersonation attacks, and replay attacks. Performance analysis demonstrates that BEPHAP surpasses existing works in both computation and communication efficiencies.

Due to the power-constrained nature of IoT devices, the security features should remain as lightweight as possible. Currently, most of the IoT network traffic is unencrypted. The leakage of smart devices' unencrypted data can come with the significant cost of a privacy breach. To have a secure channel with encrypted traffic, two endpoints in a network have to authenticate each other and calculate a short-term key. They can then communicate through an authenticated and secure channel. This process is referred to as authenticated key exchange (AKE).

{"title":"Partially Oblivious Neural Network Inference","abstract":"Oblivious inference is the task of outsourcing a ML model, like neural-networks, without disclosing critical and sensitive information, like the model's parameters. One of the most prominent solutions for secure oblivious inference is based on a powerful cryptographic tools, like Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and/or multi-party computation (MPC). Even though the implementation of oblivious inference systems schemes has impressively improved the last decade, there are still significant limitations on the ML models that they can practically implement. Especially when both the ML model and the input data's confidentiality must be protected. In this paper, we introduce the notion of partially oblivious inference. We empirically show that for neural network models, like CNNs, some information leakage can be acceptable. We therefore propose a novel trade-off between security and efficiency. In our research, we investigate the impact on security and inference runtime performance from the CNN model's weights partial leakage. We experimentally demonstrate that in a CIFAR-10 network we can leak up to $80\\%$ of the model's weights with practically no security impact, while the necessary HE-mutliplications are performed four times faster.","created":"2022-10-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15189v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Short Paper: Static and Microarchitectural ML-Based Approaches For Detecting Spectre Vulnerabilities and Attacks","abstract":"Spectre intrusions exploit speculative execution design vulnerabilities in modern processors. The attacks violate the principles of isolation in programs to gain unauthorized private user information. Current state-of-the-art detection techniques utilize micro-architectural features or vulnerable speculative code to detect these threats. However, these techniques are insufficient as Spectre attacks have proven to be more stealthy with recently discovered variants that bypass current mitigation mechanisms. Side-channels generate distinct patterns in processor cache, and sensitive information leakage is dependent on source code vulnerable to Spectre attacks, where an adversary uses these vulnerabilities, such as branch prediction, which causes a data breach. Previous studies predominantly approach the detection of Spectre attacks using the microarchitectural analysis, a reactive approach. Hence, in this paper, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of static and microarchitectural analysis-assisted machine learning approaches to detect Spectre vulnerable code snippets (preventive) and Spectre attacks (reactive). We evaluate the performance trade-offs in employing classifiers for detecting Spectre vulnerabilities and attacks.","created":"2022-10-26","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14452v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Existing legislation forbids arbitrary processing of personal data collected from individuals. Generating synthetic versions of such data with a formal privacy guarantee such as differential privacy (DP) is considered to be a solution to address privacy concerns. In this direction, we show a simple, practical, and effective recipe in the text domain: simply fine-tuning a generative language model with DP allows us to generate useful synthetic text while mitigating privacy concerns. Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that our method produces synthetic data that is competitive in terms of utility with its non-private counterpart and meanwhile provides strong protection against potential privacy leakages.","created":"2022-10-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14348v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Analyzing Privacy Leakage in Machine Learning via Multiple Hypothesis Testing: A Lesson From Fano","abstract":"Differential privacy (DP) is by far the most widely accepted framework for mitigating privacy risks in machine learning. However, exactly how small the privacy parameter $\\epsilon$ needs to be to protect against certain privacy risks in practice is still not well-understood. In this work, we study data reconstruction attacks for discrete data and analyze it under the framework of multiple hypothesis testing. We utilize different variants of the celebrated Fano's inequality to derive upper bounds on the inferential power of a data reconstruction adversary when the model is trained differentially privately. Importantly, we show that if the underlying private data takes values from a set of size $M$, then the target privacy parameter $\\epsilon$ can be $O(\\log M)$ before the adversary gains significant inferential power. Our analysis offers theoretical evidence for the empirical effectiveness of DP against data reconstruction attacks even at relatively large values of $\\epsilon$.","created":"2022-10-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13662v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Cipherfix: Mitigating Ciphertext Side-Channel Attacks in Software","abstract":"Trusted execution environments (TEEs) provide an environment for running workloads in the cloud without having to trust cloud service providers, by offering additional hardware-assisted security guarantees. However, main memory encryption as a key mechanism to protect against system-level attackers trying to read the TEE's content and physical, off-chip attackers, is insufficient. The recent Cipherleaks attacks infer secret data from TEE-protected implementations by analyzing ciphertext patterns exhibited due to deterministic memory encryption. The underlying vulnerability, dubbed the ciphertext side-channel, is neither protected by state-of-the-art countermeasures like constant-time code nor by hardware fixes.   Thus, in this paper, we present a software-based, drop-in solution that can harden existing binaries such that they can be safely executed under TEEs vulnerable to ciphertext side-channels, without requiring recompilation. We combine taint tracking with both static and dynamic binary instrumentation to find sensitive memory locations, and mitigate the leakage by masking secret data before it gets written to memory. This way, although the memory encryption remains deterministic, we destroy any secret-dependent patterns in encrypted memory. We show that our proof-of-concept implementation protects various constant-time implementations against ciphertext side-channels with reasonable overhead.","created":"2022-10-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13124v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

By applying an appropriate model for signal propagation, we show that the detection problem becomes one of distinguishing signal from noise, with the noise being described by a multivariate Gaussian distribution with unknown covariance matrix. We first design a test procedure based on the generalized likelihood ratio test, which we show through simulations to offer appreciable leak detection performance gain over conventional approaches designed in an analogous context (for radar detection). Our proposed method requires estimation of the noise covariance matrix, which can become inaccurate under high-dimensional settings, and when the measurement data is scarce. To deal with this, we present a second leak detection method, which employs a regularized covariance matrix estimate. The regularization parameter is optimized for the leak detection application by applying results from large dimensional random matrix theory. This second proposed approach is shown to yield improved performance in leak detection compared with the first approach, at the expense of requiring higher computational complexity.","created":"2022-10-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13032v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Unsupervised Graph Outlier Detection: Problem Revisit, New Insight, and Superior Method","abstract":"A large number of studies on Graph Outlier Detection (GOD) have emerged in recent years due to its wide applications, in which Unsupervised Node Outlier Detection (UNOD) on attributed networks is an important area. UNOD focuses on detecting two kinds of typical outliers in graphs: the structural outlier and the contextual outlier. Most existing works conduct experiments based on datasets with injected outliers. However, we find that the most widely-used outlier injection approach has a serious data leakage issue. By only utilizing such data leakage, a simple approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance in detecting outliers. In addition, we observe that existing algorithms have a performance drop with the mitigated data leakage issue. The other major issue is on balanced detection performance between the two types of outliers, which has not been considered by existing studies. In this paper, we analyze the cause of the data leakage issue in depth since the injection approach is a building block to advance UNOD. Moreover, we devise a novel variance-based model to detect structural outliers, which outperforms existing algorithms significantly and is more robust at kinds of injection settings. On top of this, we propose a new framework, Variance based Graph Outlier Detection (VGOD), which combines our variance-based model and attribute reconstruction model to detect outliers in a balanced way. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of VGOD. The results on 5 real-world datasets validate that VGOD achieves not only the best performance in detecting outliers but also a balanced detection performance between structural and contextual outliers.","created":"2022-10-24","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12941v3","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Mixed Precision Quantization to Tackle Gradient Leakage Attacks in Federated Learning","abstract":"Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model building among a large number of participants without the need for explicit data sharing. But this approach shows vulnerabilities when privacy inference attacks are applied to it. In particular, in the event of a gradient leakage attack, which has a higher success rate in retrieving sensitive data from the model gradients, FL models are at higher risk due to the presence of communication in their inherent architecture. The most alarming thing about this gradient leakage attack is that it can be performed in such a covert way that it does not hamper the training performance while the attackers backtrack from the gradients to get information about the raw data. Two of the most common approaches proposed as solutions to this issue are homomorphic encryption and adding noise with differential privacy parameters. These two approaches suffer from two major drawbacks. They are: the key generation process becomes tedious with the increasing number of clients, and noise-based differential privacy suffers from a significant drop in global model accuracy. As a countermeasure, we propose a mixed-precision quantized FL scheme, and we empirically show that both of the issues addressed above can be resolved. In addition, our approach can ensure more robustness as different layers of the deep model are quantized with different precision and quantization modes. We empirically proved the validity of our method with three benchmark datasets and found a minimal accuracy drop in the global model after applying quantization.","created":"2022-10-22","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13457v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

The method was evaluated on a publicly available dataset containing EEG signals recorded during a 3-oddball auditory task involving N = 50 subjects, of whom 25 suffer from PD. By extracting two features, and separating them with a straight line using a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier, we can separate the healthy from the unhealthy subjects with an accuracy of 90 % $(p < 0.03)$ using a single channel. By aggregating the information from three channels and making them vote, we obtain an accuracy of 94 %, a sensitivity of 96 % and a specificity of 92 %. The evaluation was carried out using a nested Leave-One-Out cross-validation procedure, thus preventing data leakage problems and giving a less biased evaluation.

Unfortunately, there is still an incomplete theoretical understanding of the efficacy and failure of these gradient-leakage attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to analyse training-data leakage from gradients that draws insights from both analytic and optimisation-based gradient-leakage attacks. We formulate the reconstruction problem as solving a linear system from each layer iteratively, accompanied by corrections using gradient matching. Under this framework, we claim that the solubility of the reconstruction problem is primarily determined by that of the linear system at each layer. As a result, we are able to partially attribute the leakage of the training data in a deep network to its architecture. We also propose a metric to measure the level of security of a deep learning model against gradient-based attacks on the training data.","created":"2022-10-20","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13231v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In this scenario, we assume the tension between the estimated ejected masses from early- and late-time light curves (LC) is due to approximations generally used in analytical models. First, we examine the assumption that the R-band light curve is indeed a good approximation of the bolometric light curve. Next, we test the generally used assumption that rise-time to maximum brightness is equal to the effective diffusion time-scale that can be used to derive the ejecta mass from the early LC. In addition, we analyze the effect of gamma-ray and positron-leakage, which play an important role in forming the shape of the tails of SESNe, and also can be crucial to gaining the ejecta masses from the late-time LC data. Finally, we consider the effect of the different definitions of velocity that are needed for the ejecta mass calculations.","created":"2022-10-19","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10458v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Study on the filters of atmospheric contamination in ground based CMB observation","abstract":"The atmosphere is one of the most important contamination sources in the ground-based Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. In this paper, we study three kinds of filters, which are polynomial filter, high-pass filter, and Wiener filter, to investigate their ability for removing atmospheric noise, as well as their impact on the data analysis process through the end-to-end simulations of CMB experiment. We track their performance by analyzing the response of different components of the data, including both signals and noise. In the time domain, the calculation shows that the high-pass filter has the smallest root mean square error and can achieve high filtering efficiency, followed by the Wiener filter and polynomial filter. We then perform map-making with the filtered time ordered data (TOD) to trace the effects from filters on the map domain, and the results show that the polynomial filter gives high noise residual at low frequency, which gives rise to serious leakage to small scales in map domain during the map-making process, while the high-pass filter and Wiener filter do not have such significant leakage. Then we estimate the angular power spectra of residual noise, as well as those of the input signal for comparing the filter effects in the power spectra domain. Finally, we estimate the standard deviation of the filter corrected power spectra to compare the effects from different filters, and the results show that, at low noise level, the three filters give almost comparable standard deviations on the medium and small scales, but at high noise level, the standard deviation of the polynomial filter is significantly larger. These studies can be used for the reduction of atmospheric noise in future ground-based CMB data processing.","created":"2022-10-18","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09711v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

Here, we show this common approach to confound removal biases ML models, leading to misleading results. Specifically, this common deconfounding approach can leak information such that what are null or moderate effects become amplified to near-perfect prediction when nonlinear ML approaches are subsequently applied. We identify and evaluate possible mechanisms for such confound-leakage and provide practical guidance to mitigate its negative impact. We demonstrate the real-world importance of confound-leakage by analyzing a clinical dataset where accuracy is overestimated for predicting attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with depression as a confound.

{"title":"Federated Learning with Privacy-Preserving Ensemble Attention Distillation","abstract":"Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm where many local nodes collaboratively train a central model while keeping the training data decentralized. This is particularly relevant for clinical applications since patient data are usually not allowed to be transferred out of medical facilities, leading to the need for FL. Existing FL methods typically share model parameters or employ co-distillation to address the issue of unbalanced data distribution. However, they also require numerous rounds of synchronized communication and, more importantly, suffer from a privacy leakage risk. We propose a privacy-preserving FL framework leveraging unlabeled public data for one-way offline knowledge distillation in this work. The central model is learned from local knowledge via ensemble attention distillation. Our technique uses decentralized and heterogeneous local data like existing FL approaches, but more importantly, it significantly reduces the risk of privacy leakage. We demonstrate that our method achieves very competitive performance with more robust privacy preservation based on extensive experiments on image classification, segmentation, and reconstruction tasks.","created":"2022-10-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08464v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"On the User Behavior Leakage from Recommender System Exposure","abstract":"Modern recommender systems are trained to predict users potential future interactions from users historical behavior data. During the interaction process, despite the data coming from the user side recommender systems also generate exposure data to provide users with personalized recommendation slates. Compared with the sparse user behavior data, the system exposure data is much larger in volume since only very few exposed items would be clicked by the user. Besides, the users historical behavior data is privacy sensitive and is commonly protected with careful access authorization. However, the large volume of recommender exposure data usually receives less attention and could be accessed within a relatively larger scope of various information seekers. In this paper, we investigate the problem of user behavior leakage in recommender systems. We show that the privacy sensitive user past behavior data can be inferred through the modeling of system exposure. Besides, one can infer which items the user have clicked just from the observation of current system exposure for this user. Given the fact that system exposure data could be widely accessed from a relatively larger scope, we believe that the user past behavior privacy has a high risk of leakage in recommender systems. More precisely, we conduct an attack model whose input is the current recommended item slate (i.e., system exposure) for the user while the output is the user's historical behavior. Experimental results on two real-world datasets indicate a great danger of user behavior leakage. To address the risk, we propose a two-stage privacy-protection mechanism which firstly selects a subset of items from the exposure slate and then replaces the selected items with uniform or popularity-based exposure. Experimental evaluation reveals a trade-off effect between the recommendation accuracy and the privacy disclosure risk.","created":"2022-10-16","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08435v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Sketching for First Order Method: Efficient Algorithm for Low-Bandwidth Channel and Vulnerability","abstract":"Sketching is one of the most fundamental tools in large-scale machine learning. It enables runtime and memory saving via randomly compressing the original large problem onto lower dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel sketching scheme for the first order method in large-scale distributed learning setting, such that the communication costs between distributed agents are saved while the convergence of the algorithms is still guaranteed. Given gradient information in a high dimension $d$, the agent passes the compressed information processed by a sketching matrix $R\\in \\R^{s\\times d}$ with $s\\ll d$, and the receiver de-compressed via the de-sketching matrix $R^\\top$ to ``recover'' the information in original dimension. Using such a framework, we develop algorithms for federated learning with lower communication costs. However, such random sketching does not protect the privacy of local data directly. We show that the gradient leakage problem still exists after applying the sketching technique by showing a specific gradient attack method. As a remedy, we prove rigorously that the algorithm will be differentially private by adding additional random noises in gradient information, which results in a both communication-efficient and differentially private first order approach for federated learning tasks. Our sketching scheme can be further generalized to other learning settings and might be of independent interest itself.","created":"2022-10-15","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08371v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

In addition to the ITU-R threshold of -136 dBm/200 MHz, we propose an alternative set of harmful interference thresholds directly related to the sensitivity of the satellite sensor. Our results show that the 3GPP power leakage limits are sufficient to ensure that interference from a single 5G device is not harmful if considering the ITU-R threshold, but not if the weather prediction software can tolerate only very low interference levels. Importantly, aggregate interference resulting in practice from a 5G network with realistic network densities is often harmful, even considering the least conservative ITU-R threshold. Overall, our comprehensive coexistence study thus strongly suggests that additional engineering and/or regulatory solutions will be necessary to protect weather satellite passive sensing from mm-wave cellular network interference.","created":"2022-10-14","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07994v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

Specifically, the privacy leakage of user data and the security level of the system are measured by differential privacy (DP) and mean square error security (MSE-security), respectively. To mitigate the impact of noise on learning accuracy, we propose a channel-weighted post-processing (CWPP) mechanism, which assigns a smaller weight to the gradient of the device with poor channel conditions. Furthermore, employing CWPP can avoid the issue that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the overall system is limited by the device with the worst channel condition in aligned over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL). We theoretically analyze the effect of noise on privacy and security protection and also illustrate the adverse impact of noise on learning performance by conducting convergence analysis. Based on these analytical results, we propose device scheduling policies considering privacy and security protection in different cases of channel noise. In particular, we formulate an integer nonlinear fractional programming problem aiming to minimize the negative impact of noise on the learning process. We obtain the closed-form solution to the optimization problem when the model is with high dimension. For the general case, we propose a secure and private algorithm (SPA) based on the branch-and-bound (BnB) method, which can obtain an optimal solution with low complexity.

Such an interaction rotates $E$ modes into $B$ modes in the observed CMB signal by an effect known as cosmic birefringence. Even though isotropic birefringence can be confused with the rotation produced by a miscalibration of the detectors' polarization angles the degeneracy between both effects is broken when Galactic foreground emission is used as a calibrator. In this work, we use realistic simulations of the High-Frequency Instrument of the Planck mission to test the impact that Galactic foreground emission and instrumental systematics have on the recent birefringence measurements obtained through this technique. Our results demonstrate the robustness of the methodology against the miscalibration of polarization angles and other systematic effects, like intensity-to-polarization leakage, beam leakage, or cross-polarization effects. However, our estimator is sensitive to the $EB$ correlation of polarized foreground emission. Here we propose to correct the bias induced by dust $EB$ by modeling the foreground signal with templates produced in Bayesian component-separation analyses that fit parametric models to CMB data. Acknowledging the limitations of currently available dust templates like that of the Commander sky model, high-precision CMB data and a characterization of dust beyond the modified blackbody paradigm are needed to obtain a definitive measurement of cosmic birefringence in the future.","created":"2022-10-14","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07655v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

FL has traditionally been applied to image, voice and similar data, but recently it has started to draw attention from domains including financial services where the data is predominantly tabular. However, the work on tabular data has not yet considered potential attacks, in particular attacks using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which have been successfully applied to FL for non-tabular data. This paper is the first to explore leakage of private data in Federated Learning systems that process tabular data. We design a Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-based attack model which can be deployed on a malicious client to reconstruct data and its properties from other participants. As a side-effect of considering tabular data, we are able to statistically assess the efficacy of the attack (without relying on human observation such as done for FL for images). We implement our attack model in a recently developed generic FL software framework for tabular data processing. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack model, thus suggesting that further research is required to counter GAN-based privacy attacks.","created":"2022-10-13","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06856v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

It can be applied to any multicarrier system with or without linear precoding to estimate challenging doubly-dispersive channels. A recently proposed modulation scheme using orthogonal precoding is orthogonal time-frequency and space modulation (OTFS). In OTFS, pilot and data symbols are placed in delay-Doppler (DD) domain and are jointly precoded to the time-frequency (TF) domain. On the one hand, such orthogonal precoding increases the achievable channel estimation accuracy and enables high TF diversity at the receiver. On the other hand, it introduces leakage effects which requires extensive leakage suppression when the piloting is jointly precoded with the data. To avoid this, we propose to precode the data symbols only, place pilot symbols without precoding into the TF domain, and estimate the channel coefficients by interpolating smooth functions from the pilot samples. Furthermore, we present a piloting scheme enabling a smooth control of the number and position of the pilot symbols. Our numerical results suggest that the proposed scheme provides accurate channel estimation with reduced signaling overhead compared to standard estimators using Wiener filtering in the discrete DD domain.","created":"2022-10-11","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05233v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

At the same time, the large amount of data collected by drones may incur greater communication overhead when transferred to the cloud. Federated learning as a means of privacy protection can effectively solve the above two problems. However, federated learning when applied to UAV networks also needs to consider the heterogeneity of data, which is caused by regional differences in UAV regulation. In response, this paper proposes a new algorithm FedBA to optimize the global model and solves the data heterogeneity problem. In addition, we apply the algorithm to some real datasets, and the experimental results show that the algorithm outperforms other algorithms and improves the accuracy of the local model for UAVs.","created":"2022-10-10","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04699v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"From Counter-intuitive Observations to a Fresh Look at Recommender System","abstract":"Recently, a few papers report counter-intuitive observations made from experiments on recommender system (RecSys). One observation is that users who spend more time and users who have many interactions with a recommendation system receive poorer recommendations. Another observation is that models trained by using only the more recent parts of a dataset show significant performance improvement. In this opinion paper, we interpret these counter-intuitive observations from two perspectives. First, the observations are made with respect to the global timeline of user-item interactions. Second, the observations are considered counter-intuitive because they contradict our expectation on a recommender: the more interactions a user has, the higher chance that the recommender better learns the user preference. For the first perspective, we discuss the importance of the global timeline by using the simplest baseline Popularity as a starting point. We answer two questions: (i) why the simplest model popularity is often ill-defined in academic research? and (ii) why the popularity baseline is evaluated in this way? The questions lead to a detailed discussion on the data leakage issue in many offline evaluations. As the result, model accuracies reported in many academic papers are less meaningful and incomparable. For the second perspective, we try to answer two more questions: (i) why models trained by using only the more recent parts of data demonstrate better performance? and (ii) why more interactions from users lead to poorer recommendations? The key to both questions is user preference modeling. We then propose to have a fresh look at RecSys. We discuss how to conduct more practical offline evaluations and possible ways to effectively model user preferences. The discussion and opinions in this paper are on top-N recommendation only, not on rating prediction.","created":"2022-10-09","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04149v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"FedDef: Defense Against Gradient Leakage in Federated Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems","abstract":"Deep learning (DL) methods have been widely applied to anomaly-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) to detect malicious traffic. To expand the usage scenarios of DL-based methods, the federated learning (FL) framework allows multiple users to train a global model on the basis of respecting individual data privacy. However, it has not yet been systematically evaluated how robust FL-based NIDSs are against existing privacy attacks under existing defenses. To address this issue, we propose two privacy evaluation metrics designed for FL-based NIDSs, including (1) privacy score that evaluates the similarity between the original and recovered traffic features using reconstruction attacks, and (2) evasion rate against NIDSs using Generative Adversarial Network-based adversarial attack with the reconstructed benign traffic. We conduct experiments to show that existing defenses provide little protection that the corresponding adversarial traffic can even evade the SOTA NIDS Kitsune. To defend against such attacks and build a more robust FL-based NIDS, we further propose FedDef, a novel optimization-based input perturbation defense strategy with theoretical guarantee. It achieves both high utility by minimizing the gradient distance and strong privacy protection by maximizing the input distance. We experimentally evaluate four existing defenses on four datasets and show that our defense outperforms all the baselines in terms of privacy protection with up to 7 times higher privacy score, while maintaining model accuracy loss within 3% under optimal parameter combination.","created":"2022-10-08","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04052v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Impact of instrument and data characteristics in the interferometric reconstruction of the 21 cm power spectrum","abstract":"Combining the visibilities measured by an interferometer to form a cosmological power spectrum is a complicated process. In a delay-based analysis, the mapping between instrumental and cosmological space is not a one-to-one relation. Instead, neighbouring modes contribute to the power measured at one point, with their respective contributions encoded in the window functions. To better understand the power measured by an interferometer, we assess the impact of instrument characteristics and analysis choices on these window functions. Focusing on the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) as a case study, we find that long-baseline observations correspond to enhanced low-k tails of the window functions, which facilitate foreground leakage, whilst an informed choice of bandwidth and frequency taper can reduce said tails. With simple test cases and realistic simulations, we show that, apart from tracing mode mixing, the window functions help accurately reconstruct the power spectrum estimator of simulated visibilities. The window functions depend strongly on the beam chromaticity, and less on its spatial structure - a Gaussian approximation, ignoring side lobes, is sufficient. Finally, we investigate the potential of asymmetric window functions, down-weighting the contribution of low-k power to avoid foreground leakage. The window functions presented here correspond to the latest HERA upper limits for the full Phase I data. They allow an accurate reconstruction of the power spectrum measured by the instrument and will be used in future analyses to confront theoretical models and data directly in cylindrical space.","created":"2022-10-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03721v3","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"De-risking geological carbon storage from high resolution time-lapse seismic to explainable leakage detection","abstract":"Geological carbon storage represents one of the few truly scalable technologies capable of reducing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. While this technology has the potential to scale, its success hinges on our ability to mitigate its risks. An important aspect of risk mitigation concerns assurances that the injected CO2 remains within the storage complex. Amongst the different monitoring modalities, seismic imaging stands out with its ability to attain high resolution and high fidelity images. However, these superior features come, unfortunately, at prohibitive costs and time-intensive efforts potentially rendering extensive seismic monitoring undesirable. To overcome this shortcoming, we present a methodology where time-lapse images are created by inverting non-replicated time-lapse monitoring data jointly. By no longer insisting on replication of the surveys to obtain high fidelity time-lapse images and differences, extreme costs and time-consuming labor are averted. To demonstrate our approach, hundreds of noisy time-lapse seismic datasets are simulated that contain imprints of regular CO2 plumes and irregular plumes that leak. These time-lapse datasets are subsequently inverted to produce time-lapse difference images used to train a deep neural classifier. The testing results show that the classifier is capable of detecting CO2 leakage automatically on unseen data and with a reasonable accuracy.","created":"2022-10-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03527v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"PAC Security: Automatic Privacy Measurement and Control of Data Processing","abstract":"We propose and study a new privacy definition, termed Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Security. PAC security characterizes the information-theoretic hardness to recover sensitive data given arbitrary information disclosure/leakage during/after any processing. Unlike the classic cryptographic definition and Differential Privacy (DP), which consider the adversarial (input-independent) worst case, PAC security is a simulatable metric that quantifies the instance-based impossibility of inference. A fully automatic analysis and proof generation framework is proposed: security parameters can be produced with arbitrarily high confidence via Monte-Carlo simulation for any black-box data processing oracle. This appealing automation property enables analysis of complicated data processing, where the worst-case proof in the classic privacy regime could be loose or even intractable. Moreover, we show that the produced PAC security guarantees enjoy simple composition bounds and the automatic analysis framework can be implemented in an online fashion to analyze the composite PAC security loss even under correlated randomness. On the utility side, the magnitude of (necessary) perturbation required in PAC security is not lower bounded by $\\Theta(\\sqrt{d})$ for a $d$-dimensional release but could be O(1) for many practical data processing tasks, which is in contrast to the input-independent worst-case information-theoretic lower bound. Example applications of PAC security are included with comparisons to existing works.","created":"2022-10-07","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03458v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"CANIFE: Crafting Canaries for Empirical Privacy Measurement in Federated Learning","abstract":"Federated Learning (FL) is a setting for training machine learning models in distributed environments where the clients do not share their raw data but instead send model updates to a server. However, model updates can be subject to attacks and leak private information. Differential Privacy (DP) is a leading mitigation strategy which involves adding noise to clipped model updates, trading off performance for strong theoretical privacy guarantees. Previous work has shown that the threat model of DP is conservative and that the obtained guarantees may be vacuous or may overestimate information leakage in practice. In this paper, we aim to achieve a tighter measurement of the model exposure by considering a realistic threat model. We propose a novel method, CANIFE, that uses canaries - carefully crafted samples by a strong adversary to evaluate the empirical privacy of a training round. We apply this attack to vision models trained on CIFAR-10 and CelebA and to language models trained on Sent140 and Shakespeare. In particular, in realistic FL scenarios, we demonstrate that the empirical per-round epsilon obtained with CANIFE is 4-5x lower than the theoretical bound.","created":"2022-10-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02912v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Cyber-Resilient Privacy Preservation and Secure Billing Approach for Smart Energy Metering Devices","abstract":"Most of the smart applications, such as smart energy metering devices, demand strong privacy preservation to strengthen data privacy. However, it is difficult to protect the privacy of the smart device data, especially on the client side. It is mainly because payment for billing is computed by the server deployed at the client's side, and it is highly challenging to prevent the leakage of client's information to unauthorised users. Various researchers have discussed this problem and have proposed different privacy preservation techniques. Conventional techniques suffer from the problem of high computational and communication overload on the client side. In addition, the performance of these techniques deteriorates due to computational complexity and their inability to handle the security of large-scale data. Due to these limitations, it becomes easy for the attackers to introduce malicious attacks on the server, posing a significant threat to data security. In this context, this proposal intends to design novel privacy preservation and secure billing framework using deep learning techniques to ensure data security in smart energy metering devices. This research aims to overcome the limitations of the existing techniques to achieve robust privacy preservation in smart devices and increase the cyber resilience of these devices.","created":"2022-10-06","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02760v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Fine-Tuning with Differential Privacy Necessitates an Additional Hyperparameter Search","abstract":"Models need to be trained with privacy-preserving learning algorithms to prevent leakage of possibly sensitive information contained in their training data. However, canonical algorithms like differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) do not benefit from model scale in the same way as non-private learning. This manifests itself in the form of unappealing tradeoffs between privacy and utility (accuracy) when using DP-SGD on complex tasks. To remediate this tension, a paradigm is emerging: fine-tuning with differential privacy from a model pretrained on public (i.e., non-sensitive) training data.   In this work, we identify an oversight of existing approaches for differentially private fine tuning. They do not tailor the fine-tuning approach to the specifics of learning with privacy. Our main result is to show how carefully selecting the layers being fine-tuned in the pretrained neural network allows us to establish new state-of-the-art tradeoffs between privacy and accuracy. For instance, we achieve 77.9% accuracy for $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)=(2, 10^{-5})$ on CIFAR-100 for a model pretrained on ImageNet. Our work calls for additional hyperparameter search to configure the differentially private fine-tuning procedure itself.","created":"2022-10-05","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02156v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Data Leakage in Tabular Federated Learning","abstract":"While federated learning (FL) promises to preserve privacy in distributed training of deep learning models, recent work in the image and NLP domains showed that training updates leak private data of participating clients. At the same time, most high-stakes applications of FL (e.g., legal and financial) use tabular data. Compared to the NLP and image domains, reconstruction of tabular data poses several unique challenges: (i) categorical features introduce a significantly more difficult mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem, (ii) the mix of categorical and continuous features causes high variance in the final reconstructions, and (iii) structured data makes it difficult for the adversary to judge reconstruction quality. In this work, we tackle these challenges and propose the first comprehensive reconstruction attack on tabular data, called TabLeak. TabLeak is based on three key ingredients: (i) a softmax structural prior, implicitly converting the mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem into an easier fully continuous one, (ii) a way to reduce the variance of our reconstructions through a pooled ensembling scheme exploiting the structure of tabular data, and (iii) an entropy measure which can successfully assess reconstruction quality. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TabLeak, reaching a state-of-the-art on four popular tabular datasets. For instance, on the Adult dataset, we improve attack accuracy by 10% compared to the baseline on the practically relevant batch size of 32 and further obtain non-trivial reconstructions for batch sizes as large as 128. Our findings are important as they show that performing FL on tabular data, which often poses high privacy risks, is highly vulnerable.","created":"2022-10-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01785v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Fundamental Investigation of Reactive-Convective Transport: Implications for Long-Term Carbon dioxide (CO2) Sequestration","abstract":"The density-driven convection coupled with chemical reaction is the preferred mechanism for permanently storing CO2 in saline aquifers. This study uses a 2D visual Hele-Shaw cell to evaluate and visualize the density-driven convection formed due to gravitational instabilities, also known as Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The primary goal of the experiments is to understand the various mechanisms for the mass transfer of gaseous CO2 into brine with different initial ionic concentrations and flow permeability. Moreover, the impact of CO2 flow rates, injection locations, reservoir dipping angle, and permeability heterogeneity is also investigated. We observed that the presence of salts resulted in earlier onset of convection and a larger convective finger wavelength than the case with no dissolved salts. In addition, experimental data showed a higher lateral mixing between CO2 fingers when dipping is involved. The visual investigation also revealed that the CO2 dissolution rate, measured by the rate of the convective fingers advance, depends on the type and concentration of the ions present in the brine. The CO2 dissolution for solutions with varying salt dissolved, indicated by the area of the pH-depressed region, is observed to be 0.38-0.77 times compared to when no salt is present. Although convective flow is slowed down in the presence of salts, the diffusive flux is enhanced, as observed from both qualitative and quantitative results. Moreover, the reduced formation permeability, introduced by using a flow barrier, resulted in numerous regions not being swept by the dissolved CO2, indicating an inefficient dissolution. We also investigated the effect of discrete high conductivity fractures within the flow barriers, which showed an uneven vertical sweep and enhanced flow channeling. Lastly, the parameters regarding CO2 leakage risk during storage are identified and discussed.","created":"2022-10-04","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01756v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"OpBoost: A Vertical Federated Tree Boosting Framework Based on Order-Preserving Desensitization","abstract":"Vertical Federated Learning (FL) is a new paradigm that enables users with non-overlapping attributes of the same data samples to jointly train a model without directly sharing the raw data. Nevertheless, recent works show that it's still not sufficient to prevent privacy leakage from the training process or the trained model. This paper focuses on studying the privacy-preserving tree boosting algorithms under the vertical FL. The existing solutions based on cryptography involve heavy computation and communication overhead and are vulnerable to inference attacks. Although the solution based on Local Differential Privacy (LDP) addresses the above problems, it leads to the low accuracy of the trained model.   This paper explores to improve the accuracy of the widely deployed tree boosting algorithms satisfying differential privacy under vertical FL. Specifically, we introduce a framework called OpBoost. Three order-preserving desensitization algorithms satisfying a variant of LDP called distance-based LDP (dLDP) are designed to desensitize the training data. In particular, we optimize the dLDP definition and study efficient sampling distributions to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. The proposed algorithms provide a trade-off between the privacy of pairs with large distance and the utility of desensitized values. Comprehensive evaluations show that OpBoost has a better performance on prediction accuracy of trained models compared with existing LDP approaches on reasonable settings.

Scarce communication, privacy leakage, and Byzantine attacks are the key bottlenecks of system scalability.

We propose two algorithms, named {\\em Adaptive Stochastic Sign SGD (Ada-StoSign)} and {\\em $\\beta$-Stochastic Sign SGD ($\\beta$-StoSign)}, each of which compresses the local gradients into bit vectors.   To handle unbounded gradients, Ada-StoSign uses a novel norm tracking function that adaptively adjusts a coarse estimation on the $\\ell_{\\infty}$ of the local gradients - a key parameter used in gradient compression. We show that Ada-StoSign converges in expectation with a rate $O(\\log T/\\sqrt{T} + 1/\\sqrt{M})$, where $M$ is the number of clients. To the best of our knowledge, when $M$ is sufficiently large, Ada-StoSign outperforms the state-of-the-art sign-based method whose convergence rate is $O(T^{-1/4})$.

{"title":"Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Privacy-Preserving Recommendation","abstract":"Social networks are considered to be heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) with deep learning technological advances. HGNNs, compared to homogeneous data, absorb various aspects of information about individuals in the training stage. That means more information has been covered in the learning result, especially sensitive information. However, the privacy-preserving methods on homogeneous graphs only preserve the same type of node attributes or relationships, which cannot effectively work on heterogeneous graphs due to the complexity. To address this issue, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network privacy-preserving method based on a differential privacy mechanism named HeteDP, which provides a double guarantee on graph features and topology. In particular, we first define a new attack scheme to reveal privacy leakage in the heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, we design a two-stage pipeline framework, which includes the privacy-preserving feature encoder and the heterogeneous link reconstructor with gradients perturbation based on differential privacy to tolerate data diversity and against the attack. To better control the noise and promote model performance, we utilize a bi-level optimization pattern to allocate a suitable privacy budget for the above two modules. Our experiments on four public benchmarks show that the HeteDP method is equipped to resist heterogeneous graph privacy leakage with admirable model generalization.","created":"2022-10-02","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00538v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Frequency Estimation of Evolving Data Under Local Differential Privacy","abstract":"Collecting and analyzing evolving longitudinal data has become a common practice. One possible approach to protect the users' privacy in this context is to use local differential privacy (LDP) protocols, which ensure the privacy protection of all users even in the case of a breach or data misuse. Existing LDP data collection protocols such as Google's RAPPOR and Microsoft's dBitFlipPM can have longitudinal privacy linear to the domain size k, which is excessive for large domains, such as Internet domains. To solve this issue, in this paper we introduce a new LDP data collection protocol for longitudinal frequency monitoring named LOngitudinal LOcal HAshing (LOLOHA) with formal privacy guarantees. In addition, the privacy-utility trade-off of our protocol is only linear with respect to a reduced domain size $2\\leq g \\ll k$. LOLOHA combines a domain reduction approach via local hashing with double randomization to minimize the privacy leakage incurred by data updates. As demonstrated by our theoretical analysis as well as our experimental evaluation, LOLOHA achieves a utility competitive to current state-of-the-art protocols, while substantially minimizing the longitudinal privacy budget consumption by up to k/g orders of magnitude.","created":"2022-10-01","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00262v2","tag":"data-quality"}}

Such leaks also remain largely undetected by state-of-the-art privacy analysis tools, which are very effective in uncovering privacy exposures via regular HTTP and HTTPS channels. In this study, we design and implement, ThirdEye, to significantly extend the visibility of current privacy analysis tools, in terms of the exposures that happen across various non-standard and covert channels, i.e., via any protocol over TCP/UDP (beyond HTTP/S), and using multi-layer custom encryption over HTTP/S and non-HTTP protocols. Besides network exposures, we also consider covert channels via storage media that also leverage custom encryption layers. Using ThirdEye, we analyzed 12,598 top-apps in various categories from Androidrank, and found that 2887/12,598 (22.92%) apps used custom encryption/decryption for network transmission and storing content in shared device storage, and 2465/2887 (85.38%) of those apps sent device information (e.g., advertising ID, list of installed apps) over the network that can fingerprint users. Besides, 299 apps transmitted insecure encrypted content over HTTP/non-HTTP protocols; 22 apps that used authentication tokens over HTTPS, happen to expose them over insecure (albeit custom encrypted) HTTP/non-HTTP channels. We found non-standard and covert channels with multiple levels of obfuscation (e.g., encrypted data over HTTPS, encryption at nested levels), and the use of vulnerable keys and cryptographic algorithms. Our findings can provide valuable insights into the evolving field of non-standard and covert channels, and help spur new countermeasures against such privacy leakage and security issues.","created":"2022-09-29","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15107v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

{"title":"Improving Power Spectral Estimation using Multitapering: Precise asteroseismic modeling of stars, exoplanets, and beyond","abstract":"Asteroseismic time-series data have imprints of stellar oscillation modes, whose detection and characterization through time-series analysis allows us to probe stellar interiors physics. Such analyses usually occur in the Fourier domain by computing the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, an estimator of the \\textit{power spectrum} underlying unevenly-sampled time-series data. However, the LS periodogram suffers from the statistical problems of (1) inconsistency (or noise) and (2) bias due to high spectral leakage. In addition, it is designed to detect strictly periodic signals but is unsuitable for non-sinusoidal periodic or quasi-periodic signals. Here, we develop a multitaper spectral estimation method that tackles the inconsistency and bias problems of the LS periodogram. We combine this multitaper method with the Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (\\texttt{mtNUFFT}) to more precisely estimate the frequencies of asteroseismic signals that are non-sinusoidal periodic (e.g., exoplanet transits) or quasi-periodic (e.g., pressure modes). We illustrate this using a simulated and the Kepler-91 red giant light curve. Particularly, we detect the Kepler-91b exoplanet and precisely estimate its period, $6.246 \\pm 0.002$ days, in the frequency domain using the multitaper F-test alone.

To date, practical attacks on cryptosystems and media libraries are demonstrated under different scenarios, inferring secret keys and reconstructing private media data such as images.   This work first presents eight criteria for designing a full-fledged detector for cache side-channel vulnerabilities. Then, we propose CacheQL, a novel detector that meets all of these criteria. CacheQL precisely quantifies information leaks of binary code, by characterizing the distinguishability of logged side channel traces. Moreover, CacheQL models leakage as a cooperative game, allowing information leakage to be precisely distributed to program points vulnerable to cache side channels. CacheQL is meticulously optimized to analyze whole side channel traces logged from production software (where each trace can have millions of records), and it alleviates randomness introduced by cryptographic blinding, ORAM, or real-world noises.   Our evaluation quantifies side-channel leaks of production cryptographic and media software. We further localize vulnerabilities reported by previous detectors and also identify a few hundred new leakage sites in recent OpenSSL (ver. 3.0.0), MbedTLS (ver. 3.0.0), Libgcrypt (ver. 1.9.4).

{"title":"On the Choice of Databases in Differential Privacy Composition","abstract":"Differential privacy (DP) is a widely applied paradigm for releasing data while maintaining user privacy. Its success is to a large part due to its composition property that guarantees privacy even in the case of multiple data releases. Consequently, composition has received a lot of attention from the research community: there exist several composition theorems for adversaries with different amounts of flexibility in their choice of mechanisms. But apart from mechanisms, the adversary can also choose the databases on which these mechanisms are invoked. The classic tool for analyzing the composition of DP mechanisms, the so-called composition experiment, neither allows for incorporating constraints on databases nor for different assumptions on the adversary's prior knowledge about database membership. We therefore propose a generalized composition experiment (GCE), which has this flexibility. We show that composition theorems that hold with respect to the classic composition experiment also hold with respect to the worst case of the GCE. This implies that existing composition theorems give a privacy guarantee for more cases than are explicitly covered by the classic composition experiment. Beyond these theoretical insights, we demonstrate two practical applications of the GCE: the first application is to give better privacy bounds in the presence of restrictions on the choice of databases; the second application is to reason about how the adversary's prior knowledge influences the privacy leakage. In this context, we show a connection between adversaries with an uninformative prior and subsampling, an important primitive in DP. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to analyze the interplay between the databases in DP composition, and thereby gives both a better understanding of composition and practical tools for obtaining better composition bounds.","created":"2022-09-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13697v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

However, existing privacy-preserving solutions are designed for tackling the privacy issue only during the model training and results collection phases. The problem of privacy leakage still exists when directly sharing the private user interaction data with organizations or releasing them to the public. To address this problem, in this paper, we present a User Privacy Controllable Synthetic Data Generation model (short for UPC-SDG), which generates synthetic interaction data for users based on their privacy preferences. The generation model aims to provide certain privacy guarantees while maximizing the utility of the generated synthetic data at both data level and item level. Specifically, at the data level, we design a selection module that selects those items that contribute less to a user's preferences from the user's interaction data. At the item level, a synthetic data generation module is proposed to generate a synthetic item corresponding to the selected item based on the user's preferences. Furthermore, we also present a privacy-utility trade-off strategy to balance the privacy and utility of the synthetic data. Extensive experiments and ablation studies have been conducted on three publicly accessible datasets to justify our method, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating synthetic data under users' privacy preferences.","created":"2022-09-27","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13133v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"When Digital Economy Meets Web3.0: Applications and Challenges","abstract":"With the continuous development of web technology, Web3.0 has attracted a considerable amount of attention due to its unique decentralized characteristics. The digital economy is an important driver of high-quality economic development and is currently in a rapid development stage. In the digital economy scenario, the centralized nature of the Internet and other characteristics usually bring about security issues such as infringement and privacy leakage. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate how to use Web3.0 technologies to solve the pain points encountered in the development of the digital economy by fully exploring the critical technologies of digital economy and Web3.0. In this paper, we discuss the aspects of Web3.0 that should be integrated with the digital economy to better find the entry point to solve the problems by examining the latest advances of Web3.0 in machine learning, finance, and data management. We hope this research will inspire those who are involved in both academia and industry, and finally help to build a favourable ecology for the digital economy.","created":"2022-09-26","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08993v3","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Taming Client Dropout and Improving Efficiency for Distributed Differential Privacy in Federated Learning","abstract":"Federated learning (FL) is increasingly deployed among multiple clients (e.g., mobile devices) to train a shared model over decentralized data. To address the privacy concerns, FL systems need to protect the clients' data from being revealed during training, and also control the data leakage through trained models when exposed to untrusted domains. Distributed differential privacy (DP) offers an appealing solution in this regard as it achieves an informed tradeoff between privacy and utility without a trusted server. However, existing distributed DP mechanisms work impractically in the presence of client dropout, resulting in either poor privacy guarantees or degraded training accuracy. In addition, these mechanisms also suffer from severe efficiency issues with long time-to-accuracy training performance.   We present Hyades, a distributed differentially private FL framework that is highly efficient and resilient to client dropout. Specifically, we develop a novel 'add-then-remove' scheme where a required noise level can be enforced in each FL training round even though some sampled clients may drop out in the end; therefore, the privacy budget is consumed carefully even in the presence of client dropout. To boost performance, Hyades runs as a distributed pipeline architecture via encapsulating the communication and computation operations into stages. It automatically divides the global model aggregation into several chunk-aggregation tasks and pipelines them for optimal speedup. Evaluation through large-scale cloud deployment shows that Hyades can efficiently handle client dropout in various realistic FL scenarios, attaining the optimal privacy-utility tradeoff and accelerating the training by up to 2.1$\\times$ compared to existing solutions.","created":"2022-09-26","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12528v2","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Design of the on-board data compression for the bolometer data of LiteBIRD","abstract":"LiteBIRD is a space-borne experiment dedicated to detecting large-scale $B$-mode anisotropies in the linear polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) predicted by the theory of inflation. It is planned to be launched in the late 2020s to the second Lagrange point (L2) of the Sun-Earth system. LiteBIRD will map the sky in 15 frequency bands. In comparison to $\\it{Planck}$ HFI, the previous low-temperature bolometer-based satellite for CMB observations, the number of detector has increased by two orders of magnitude, up to $\\sim$5000 detectors in total. The data rate is 19 Hz from each detector. The bandpass to the ground is limited to 10 Mbps using the X-band for a few hours per day. These require the data to be compressed by more than 50 %. The exact value depends on how much information entropy is contained in the real data. We have thus evaluated the compression by simulating the time-ordered data of polarization sensitive bolometers. The foreground emission, detector noise, cosmic ray glitches, leakage from the CMB intensity to polarization, etc. are simulated. We investigated several algorithms and demonstrated that the required compression ratio can be achieved by some of them. We describe the details of this evaluation and propose algorithms that can be employed in the on-board digital electronics of LiteBIRD.","created":"2022-09-26","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12492v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Transfer learning for self-supervised, blind-spot seismic denoising","abstract":"Noise in seismic data arises from numerous sources and is continually evolving. The use of supervised deep learning procedures for denoising of seismic datasets often results in poor performance: this is due to the lack of noise-free field data to act as training targets and the large difference in characteristics between synthetic and field datasets. Self-supervised, blind-spot networks typically overcome these limitation by training directly on the raw, noisy data. However, such networks often rely on a random noise assumption, and their denoising capabilities quickly decrease in the presence of even minimally-correlated noise. Extending from blind-spots to blind-masks can efficiently suppress coherent noise along a specific direction, but it cannot adapt to the ever-changing properties of noise. To preempt the network's ability to predict the signal and reduce its opportunity to learn the noise properties, we propose an initial, supervised training of the network on a frugally-generated synthetic dataset prior to fine-tuning in a self-supervised manner on the field dataset of interest. Considering the change in peak signal-to-noise ratio, as well as the volume of noise reduced and signal leakage observed, we illustrate the clear benefit in initialising the self-supervised network with the weights from a supervised base-training. This is further supported by a test on a field dataset where the fine-tuned network strikes the best balance between signal preservation and noise reduction. Finally, the use of the unrealistic, frugally-generated synthetic dataset for the supervised base-training includes a number of benefits: minimal prior geological knowledge is required, substantially reduced computational cost for the dataset generation, and a reduced requirement of re-training the network should recording conditions change, to name a few.","created":"2022-09-25","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12210v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"FIAT: Fine-grained Information Audit for Trustless Transborder Data Flow","abstract":"Auditing the information leakage of latent sensitive features during the transborder data flow has attracted sufficient attention from global digital regulators. However, there is missing a technical approach for the audit practice due to two technical challenges. Firstly, there is a lack of theory and tools for measuring the information of sensitive latent features in a dataset. Secondly, the transborder data flow involves multi-stakeholders with diverse interests, which means the audit must be trustless. Despite the tremendous efforts in protecting data privacy, an important issue that has long been neglected is that the transmitted data in data flows can leak other regulated information that is not explicitly contained in the data, leading to unaware information leakage risks. To unveil such risks trustfully before the actual data transfer, we propose FIAT, a Fine-grained Information Audit system for Trustless transborder data flow. In FIAT, we use a learning approach to quantify the amount of information leakage, while the technologies of zero-knowledge proof and smart contracts are applied to provide trustworthy and privacy-preserving auditing results. Experiments show that large information leakage can boost the predictability of uninvolved information using simple machine-learning models, revealing the importance of information auditing. Further performance benchmarking also validates the efficiency and scalability of the FIAT auditing system.","created":"2022-09-23","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11451v3","tag":"data-quality"}}
