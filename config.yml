sections:
  - name: "New Datasets"
    instructions: | 
      This label represents arxiv articles that discuss the release of a new dataset. 
      When annotating, it's important that the sentence in question clearly confirms,
      without a doubt, that the article is about a new dataset or corpus. New benchmarks
      on a existing dataset are not of interest.
    label: "new-dataset"
    threshold: 0.6
  - name: "Prompt Engineering"
    instructions: |
      This label represents arxiv articles that discuss prompt engineering.
      When annotating, it's important that the sentence in question clearly confirms,
      without a doubt, that the article is about prompt engineering. It can include 
      comparisons between prompt engineering and ML, but general articles about large
      language models that don't discuss the design of the prompt is not of interest.
    label: "prompt-eng"
    threshold: 0.6
  - name: "Data Quality"
    instructions: |
      This label represents arxiv articles that discuss data quality issues in existing 
      datasets. It may also relate to annotation issues.
    label: "data-quality"
    threshold: 0.6
  - name: "ML security"
    instructions: |
      This label represents papers about ml and security issues.
    label: "ml-security"
    threshold: 0.6
