{"title":"Event-Centric Query Expansion in Web Search","abstract":"In search engines, query expansion (QE) is a crucial technique to improve search experience. Previous studies often rely on long-term search log mining, which leads to slow updates and is sub-optimal for time-sensitive news searches. In this work, we present Event-Centric Query Expansion (EQE), a novel QE system that addresses these issues by mining the best expansion from a significant amount of potential events rapidly and accurately. This system consists of four stages, i.e., event collection, event reformulation, semantic retrieval and online ranking. Specifically, we first collect and filter news headlines from websites. Then we propose a generation model that incorporates contrastive learning and prompt-tuning techniques to reformulate these headlines to concise candidates. Additionally, we fine-tune a dual-tower semantic model to function as an encoder for event retrieval and explore a two-stage contrastive training approach to enhance the accuracy of event retrieval. Finally, we rank the retrieved events and select the optimal one as QE, which is then used to improve the retrieval of event-related documents. Through offline analysis and online A/B testing, we observe that the EQE system significantly improves many metrics compared to the baseline. The system has been deployed in Tencent QQ Browser Search and served hundreds of millions of users.

{"title":"ConES: Concept Embedding Search for Parameter Efficient Tuning Large Vision Language Models","abstract":"Large pre-trained vision-language models have shown great prominence in transferring pre-acquired knowledge to various domains and downstream tasks with appropriate prompting or tuning. Existing prevalent tuning methods can be generally categorized into three genres: 1) prompt engineering by creating suitable prompt texts, which is time-consuming and requires domain expertise; 2) or simply fine-tuning the whole model, which is extremely inefficient; 3) prompt tuning through parameterized prompt embeddings with the text encoder. Nevertheless, all methods rely on the text encoder for bridging the modality gap between vision and language. In this work, we question the necessity of the cumbersome text encoder for a more lightweight and efficient tuning paradigm as well as more representative prompt embeddings closer to the image representations. To achieve this, we propose a Concept Embedding Search (ConES) approach by optimizing prompt embeddings -- without the need of the text encoder -- to capture the 'concept' of the image modality through a variety of task objectives. By dropping the text encoder, we are able to significantly speed up the learning process, \\eg, from about an hour to just ten minutes in our experiments for personalized text-to-image generation without impairing the generation quality. Moreover, our proposed approach is orthogonal to current existing tuning methods since the searched concept embeddings can be further utilized in the next stage of fine-tuning the pre-trained large models for boosting performance. Extensive experiments show that our approach can beat the prompt tuning and textual inversion methods in a variety of downstream tasks including objection detection, instance segmentation, and image generation. Our approach also shows better generalization capability for unseen concepts in specialized domains, such as the medical domain.","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18993v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

{"title":"Encouraging Divergent Thinking in Large Language Models through Multi-Agent Debate","abstract":"Modern large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown remarkable performance on general language tasks but still struggle on complex reasoning tasks, which drives the research on cognitive behaviors of LLMs to explore human-like problem-solving strategies. Along this direction, one representative strategy is self-reflection, which asks an LLM to refine the solution with the feedback generated by itself iteratively. However, our study shows that such reflection-style methods suffer from the Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) problem: once the LLM has established confidence in its solutions, it is unable to generate novel thoughts later through reflection even if its initial stance is incorrect. To address the DoT problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework, in which multiple agents express their arguments in the state of \"tit for tat\" and a judge manages the debate process to obtain a final solution. Clearly, our MAD framework encourages divergent thinking in LLMs which would be helpful for tasks that require deep levels of contemplation. Experiment results on two challenging datasets, commonsense machine translation and counter-intuitive arithmetic reasoning, demonstrate the effectiveness of our MAD framework. Extensive analyses suggest that the adaptive break of debate and the modest level of \"tit for tat\" state are required for MAD to obtain good performance. Moreover, we find that LLMs might not be a fair judge if different LLMs are used for agents.

{"title":"Does Conceptual Representation Require Embodiment? Insights From Large Language Models","abstract":"Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have the potential to shed light on the debate regarding the extent to which knowledge representation requires the grounding of embodied experience. Despite learning from limited modalities (e.g., text for GPT-3.5, and text+image for GPT-4), LLMs have nevertheless demonstrated human-like behaviors in various psychology tasks, which may provide an alternative interpretation of the acquisition of conceptual knowledge. We compared lexical conceptual representations between humans and ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on subjective ratings of various lexical conceptual features or dimensions (e.g., emotional arousal, concreteness, haptic, etc.). The results show that both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were strongly correlated with humans in some abstract dimensions, such as emotion and salience. In dimensions related to sensory and motor domains, GPT-3.5 shows weaker correlations while GPT-4 has made significant progress compared to GPT-3.5. Still, GPT-4 struggles to fully capture motor aspects of conceptual knowledge such as actions with foot/leg, mouth/throat, and torso. Moreover, we found that GPT-4's progress can largely be associated with its training in the visual domain. Certain aspects of conceptual representation appear to exhibit a degree of independence from sensory capacities, but others seem to necessitate them. Our findings provide insights into the complexities of knowledge representation from diverse perspectives and highlights the potential influence of embodied experience in shaping language and cognition.","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19103v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}

In particular, we check their ability to Understand the problem at hand; Apply appropriate algorithms or methods for its solution; and Generate a coherent response and a correct answer. We use 30 questions that are clear, without any ambiguities, fully described with plain text only, and have a unique, well defined correct answer. The questions are divided into two sets of 15 each. The questions of Set A are 15 \"Original\" problems that cannot be found online, while Set B contains 15 \"Published\" problems that one can find online, usually with their solution. Each question is posed three times to each chatbot. The answers are recorded and discussed, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. It has been found that for straightforward arithmetic, algebraic expressions, or basic logic puzzles, chatbots may provide accurate solutions, although not in every attempt. However, for more complex mathematical problems or advanced logic tasks, their answers, although written in a usually \"convincing\" way, may not be reliable. Consistency is also an issue, as many times a chatbot will provide conflicting answers when given the same question more than once. A comparative quantitative evaluation of the three chatbots is made through scoring their final answers based on correctness. It was found that ChatGPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT-3.5 in both sets of questions. Bard comes third in the original questions of Set A, behind the other two chatbots, while it has the best performance (first place) in the published questions of Set B. This is probably because Bard has direct access to the internet, in contrast to ChatGPT chatbots which do not have any communication with the outside world.","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18618v1","tag":"prompt-eng"}}
{"title":"AlphaBlock: Embodied Finetuning for Vision-Language Reasoning in Robot Manipulation","abstract":"We propose a novel framework for learning high-level cognitive capabilities in robot manipulation tasks, such as making a smiley face using building blocks. These tasks often involve complex multi-step reasoning, presenting significant challenges due to the limited paired data connecting human instructions (e.g., making a smiley face) and robot actions (e.g., end-effector movement). Existing approaches relieve this challenge by adopting an open-loop paradigm decomposing high-level instructions into simple sub-task plans, and executing them step-by-step using low-level control models. However, these approaches are short of instant observations in multi-step reasoning, leading to sub-optimal results. To address this issue, we propose to automatically collect a cognitive robot dataset by Large Language Models (LLMs). The resulting dataset AlphaBlock consists of 35 comprehensive high-level tasks of multi-step text plans and paired observation sequences. To enable efficient data acquisition, we employ elaborated multi-round prompt designs that effectively reduce the burden of extensive human involvement. We further propose a closed-loop multi-modal embodied planning model that autoregressively generates plans by taking image observations as input. To facilitate effective learning, we leverage MiniGPT-4 with a frozen visual encoder and LLM, and finetune additional vision adapter and Q-former to enable fine-grained spatial perception for manipulation tasks. We conduct experiments to verify the superiority over existing open and closed-loop methods, and achieve a significant increase in success rate by 21.4% and 14.5% over ChatGPT and GPT-4 based robot tasks.

We conduct a user study on summarized answers generated from state-of-the-art models and our newly proposed extract-and-decontextualize approach.

{"title":"Learning without Forgetting for Vision-Language Models","abstract":"Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) or continual learning is a desired capability in the real world, which requires a learning system to adapt to new tasks without forgetting former ones. While traditional CIL methods focus on visual information to grasp core features, recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLM) have shown promising capabilities in learning generalizable representations with the aid of textual information. However, when continually trained with new classes, VLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of former knowledge. Applying VLMs to CIL poses two major challenges: 1) how to adapt the model without forgetting; and 2) how to make full use of the multi-modal information. To this end, we propose PROjectiOn Fusion (PROOF) that enables VLMs to learn without forgetting. To handle the first challenge, we propose training task-specific projections based on the frozen image/text encoders. When facing new tasks, new projections are expanded and former projections are fixed, alleviating the forgetting of old concepts. For the second challenge, we propose the fusion module to better utilize the cross-modality information. By jointly adjusting visual and textual features, the model can capture semantic information with stronger representation ability.

{"title":"Make-A-Voice: Unified Voice Synthesis With Discrete Representation","abstract":"Various applications of voice synthesis have been developed independently despite the fact that they generate \"voice\" as output in common. In addition, the majority of voice synthesis models currently rely on annotated audio data, but it is crucial to scale them to self-supervised datasets in order to effectively capture the wide range of acoustic variations present in human voice, including speaker identity, emotion, and prosody. In this work, we propose Make-A-Voice, a unified framework for synthesizing and manipulating voice signals from discrete representations. Make-A-Voice leverages a \"coarse-to-fine\" approach to model the human voice, which involves three stages: 1) semantic stage: model high-level transformation between linguistic content and self-supervised semantic tokens, 2) acoustic stage: introduce varying control signals as acoustic conditions for semantic-to-acoustic modeling, and 3) generation stage: synthesize high-fidelity waveforms from acoustic tokens. Make-A-Voice offers notable benefits as a unified voice synthesis framework: 1) Data scalability: the major backbone (i.e., acoustic and generation stage) does not require any annotations, and thus the training data could be scaled up. 2) Controllability and conditioning flexibility: we investigate different conditioning mechanisms and effectively handle three voice synthesis applications, including text-to-speech (TTS), voice conversion (VC), and singing voice synthesis (SVS) by re-synthesizing the discrete voice representations with prompt guidance.

This problem arises in scientific applications where access to uncorrupted samples is impossible or expensive to acquire. Another benefit of our approach is the ability to train generative models that are less likely to memorize individual training samples since they never observe clean training data. Our main idea is to introduce additional measurement distortion during the diffusion process and require the model to predict the original corrupted image from the further corrupted image. We prove that our method leads to models that learn the conditional expectation of the full uncorrupted image given this additional measurement corruption. This holds for any corruption process that satisfies some technical conditions (and in particular includes inpainting and compressed sensing). We train models on standard benchmarks (CelebA, CIFAR-10 and AFHQ) and show that we can learn the distribution even when all the training samples have $90\\%$ of their pixels missing. We also show that we can finetune foundation models on small corrupted datasets (e.g. MRI scans with block corruptions) and learn the clean distribution without memorizing the training set.","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19256v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

But in addition to a number of practical limitations that make their use unlikely, we make a number of findings that call into question their ability to safeguard data. First, it is widely believed that neural networks trained on unlearnable datasets only learn shortcuts, simpler rules that are not useful for generalization. In contrast, we find that networks actually can learn useful features that can be reweighed for high test performance, suggesting that image privacy is not preserved. Unlearnable datasets are also believed to induce learning shortcuts through linear separability of added perturbations. We provide a counterexample, demonstrating that linear separability of perturbations is not a necessary condition. To emphasize why linearly separable perturbations should not be relied upon, we propose an orthogonal projection attack which allows learning from unlearnable datasets published in ICML 2021 and ICLR 2023.

{"title":"AlteredAvatar: Stylizing Dynamic 3D Avatars with Fast Style Adaptation","abstract":"This paper presents a method that can quickly adapt dynamic 3D avatars to arbitrary text descriptions of novel styles. Among existing approaches for avatar stylization, direct optimization methods can produce excellent results for arbitrary styles but they are unpleasantly slow. Furthermore, they require redoing the optimization process from scratch for every new input. Fast approximation methods using feed-forward networks trained on a large dataset of style images can generate results for new inputs quickly, but tend not to generalize well to novel styles and fall short in quality. We therefore investigate a new approach, AlteredAvatar, that combines those two approaches using the meta-learning framework. In the inner loop, the model learns to optimize to match a single target style well; while in the outer loop, the model learns to stylize efficiently across many styles. After training, AlteredAvatar learns an initialization that can quickly adapt within a small number of update steps to a novel style, which can be given using texts, a reference image, or a combination of both. We show that AlteredAvatar can achieve a good balance between speed, flexibility and quality, while maintaining consistency across a wide range of novel views and facial expressions.","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19245v1","tag":"new-dataset"}}

{"title":"A generalized framework to predict continuous scores from medical ordinal labels","abstract":"Many variables of interest in clinical medicine, like disease severity, are recorded using discrete ordinal categories such as normal/mild/moderate/severe. These labels are used to train and evaluate disease severity prediction models. However, ordinal categories represent a simplification of an underlying continuous severity spectrum. Using continuous scores instead of ordinal categories is more sensitive to detecting small changes in disease severity over time. Here, we present a generalized framework that accurately predicts continuously valued variables using only discrete ordinal labels during model development. We found that for three clinical prediction tasks, models that take the ordinal relationship of the training labels into account outperformed conventional multi-class classification models. Particularly the continuous scores generated by ordinal classification and regression models showed a significantly higher correlation with expert rankings of disease severity and lower mean squared errors compared to the multi-class classification models. Furthermore, the use of MC dropout significantly improved the ability of all evaluated deep learning approaches to predict continuously valued scores that truthfully reflect the underlying continuous target variable. We showed that accurate continuously valued predictions can be generated even if the model development only involves discrete ordinal labels. The novel framework has been validated on three different clinical prediction tasks and has proven to bridge the gap between discrete ordinal labels and the underlying continuously valued variables.","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19097v1","tag":"data-quality"}}

It is of significant practical interest and more challenging than unconstrained lyric generation as the music imposes additional constraints onto the lyrics. The training data is limited as most songs are copyrighted, resulting in models that underfit the complicated cross-modal relationship between melody and lyrics. In this work, we propose a method for generating high-quality lyrics without training on any aligned melody-lyric data. Specifically, we design a hierarchical lyric generation framework that first generates a song outline and second the complete lyrics. The framework enables disentanglement of training (based purely on text) from inference (melody-guided text generation) to circumvent the shortage of parallel data.   We leverage the segmentation and rhythm alignment between melody and lyrics to compile the given melody into decoding constraints as guidance during inference. The two-step hierarchical design also enables content control via the lyric outline, a much-desired feature for democratizing collaborative song creation. Experimental results show that our model can generate high-quality lyrics that are more on-topic, singable, intelligible, and coherent than strong baselines, for example SongMASS, a SOTA model trained on a parallel dataset, with a 24% relative overall quality improvement based on human ratings.

{"title":"Compression with Bayesian Implicit Neural Representations","abstract":"Many common types of data can be represented as functions that map coordinates to signal values, such as pixel locations to RGB values in the case of an image. Based on this view, data can be compressed by overfitting a compact neural network to its functional representation and then encoding the network weights. However, most current solutions for this are inefficient, as quantization to low-bit precision substantially degrades the reconstruction quality. To address this issue, we propose overfitting variational Bayesian neural networks to the data and compressing an approximate posterior weight sample using relative entropy coding instead of quantizing and entropy coding it. This strategy enables direct optimization of the rate-distortion performance by minimizing the $\\beta$-ELBO, and target different rate-distortion trade-offs for a given network architecture by adjusting $\\beta$. Moreover, we introduce an iterative algorithm for learning prior weight distributions and employ a progressive refinement process for the variational posterior that significantly enhances performance. Experiments show that our method achieves strong performance on image and audio compression while retaining simplicity.","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19185v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Monocrystalline Si/$\u03b2$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ p-n heterojunction diodes fabricated via grafting","abstract":"The $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ has exceptional electronic properties with vast potential in power and RF electronics. Despite the excellent demonstrations of high-performance unipolar devices, the lack of p-type doping in $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ has hindered the development of Ga$_2$O$_3$-based bipolar devices. The approach of p-n diodes formed by polycrystalline p-type oxides with n-type $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ can face severe challenges in further advancing the $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ bipolar devices due to their unfavorable band alignment and the poor p-type oxide crystal quality. In this work, we applied the semiconductor grafting approach to fabricate monocrystalline Si/$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ p-n diodes for the first time. With enhanced concentration of oxygen atoms at the interface of Si/$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, double side surface passivation was achieved for both Si and $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ with an interface Dit value of 1-3 x 1012 /cm2 eV. A Si/$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ p-n diode array with high fabrication yield was demonstrated along with a diode rectification of 1.3 x 107 at +/- 2 V, a diode ideality factor of 1.13 and avalanche reverse breakdown characteristics. The diodes C-V shows frequency dispersion-free characteristics from 10 kHz to 2 MHz. Our work has set the foundation toward future development of $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based transistors.","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19138v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"DisCLIP: Open-Vocabulary Referring Expression Generation","abstract":"Referring Expressions Generation (REG) aims to produce textual descriptions that unambiguously identifies specific objects within a visual scene. Traditionally, this has been achieved through supervised learning methods, which perform well on specific data distributions but often struggle to generalize to new images and concepts. To address this issue, we present a novel approach for REG, named DisCLIP, short for discriminative CLIP. We build on CLIP, a large-scale visual-semantic model, to guide an LLM to generate a contextual description of a target concept in an image while avoiding other distracting concepts. Notably, this optimization happens at inference time and does not require additional training or tuning of learned parameters. We measure the quality of the generated text by evaluating the capability of a receiver model to accurately identify the described object within the scene. To achieve this, we use a frozen zero-shot comprehension module as a critique of our generated referring expressions. We evaluate DisCLIP on multiple referring expression benchmarks through human evaluation and show that it significantly outperforms previous methods on out-of-domain datasets. Our results highlight the potential of using pre-trained visual-semantic models for generating high-quality contextual descriptions.","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19108v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"NicePIM: Design Space Exploration for Processing-In-Memory DNN Accelerators with 3D-Stacked-DRAM","abstract":"With the widespread use of deep neural networks(DNNs) in intelligent systems, DNN accelerators with high performance and energy efficiency are greatly demanded. As one of the feasible processing-in-memory(PIM) architectures, 3D-stacked-DRAM-based PIM(DRAM-PIM) architecture enables large-capacity memory and low-cost memory access, which is a promising solution for DNN accelerators with better performance and energy efficiency. However, the low-cost characteristics of stacked DRAM and the distributed manner of memory access and data storing require us to rebalance the hardware design and DNN mapping. In this paper, we propose NicePIM to efficiently explore the design space of hardware architecture and DNN mapping of DRAM-PIM accelerators, which consists of three key components: PIM-Tuner, PIM-Mapper and Data-Scheduler. PIM-Tuner optimizes the hardware configurations leveraging a DNN model for classifying area-compliant architectures and a deep kernel learning model for identifying better hardware parameters. PIM-Mapper explores a variety of DNN mapping configurations, including parallelism between branches of DNN, DNN layer partitioning, DRAM capacity allocation and data layout pattern in DRAM to generate high-hardware-utilization DNN mapping schemes for various hardware configurations. The Data-Scheduler employs an integer-linear-programming-based data scheduling algorithm to alleviate the inter-PIM-node communication overhead of data-sharing brought by DNN layer partitioning. Experimental results demonstrate that NicePIM can optimize hardware configurations for DRAM-PIM systems effectively and can generate high-quality DNN mapping schemes with latency and energy cost reduced by 37% and 28% on average respectively compared to the baseline method.","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19041v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"StyleAvatar3D: Leveraging Image-Text Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity 3D Avatar Generation","abstract":"The recent advancements in image-text diffusion models have stimulated research interest in large-scale 3D generative models. Nevertheless, the limited availability of diverse 3D resources presents significant challenges to learning. In this paper, we present a novel method for generating high-quality, stylized 3D avatars that utilizes pre-trained image-text diffusion models for data generation and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based 3D generation network for training. Our method leverages the comprehensive priors of appearance and geometry offered by image-text diffusion models to generate multi-view images of avatars in various styles. During data generation, we employ poses extracted from existing 3D models to guide the generation of multi-view images. To address the misalignment between poses and images in data, we investigate view-specific prompts and develop a coarse-to-fine discriminator for GAN training. We also delve into attribute-related prompts to increase the diversity of the generated avatars. Additionally, we develop a latent diffusion model within the style space of StyleGAN to enable the generation of avatars based on image inputs. Our approach demonstrates superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and diversity of the produced avatars.","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19012v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"A Recipe for Efficient SBIR Models: Combining Relative Triplet Loss with Batch Normalization and Knowledge Distillation","abstract":"Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (SBIR) is a crucial task in multimedia retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve a set of images that match a given sketch query. Researchers have already proposed several well-performing solutions for this task, but most focus on enhancing embedding through different approaches such as triplet loss, quadruplet loss, adding data augmentation, and using edge extraction. In this work, we tackle the problem from various angles. We start by examining the training data quality and show some of its limitations. Then, we introduce a Relative Triplet Loss (RTL), an adapted triplet loss to overcome those limitations through loss weighting based on anchors similarity. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that replacing a triplet loss with RTL outperforms previous state-of-the-art without the need for any data augmentation. In addition, we demonstrate why batch normalization is more suited for SBIR embeddings than l2-normalization and show that it improves significantly the performance of our models. We further investigate the capacity of models required for the photo and sketch domains and demonstrate that the photo encoder requires a higher capacity than the sketch encoder, which validates the hypothesis formulated in [34]. Then, we propose a straightforward approach to train small models, such as ShuffleNetv2 [22] efficiently with a marginal loss of accuracy through knowledge distillation. The same approach used with larger models enabled us to outperform previous state-of-the-art results and achieve a recall of 62.38% at k = 1 on The Sketchy Database [30].","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18988v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"DEPLAIN: A German Parallel Corpus with Intralingual Translations into Plain Language for Sentence and Document Simplification","abstract":"Text simplification is an intralingual translation task in which documents, or sentences of a complex source text are simplified for a target audience. The success of automatic text simplification systems is highly dependent on the quality of parallel data used for training and evaluation. To advance sentence simplification and document simplification in German, this paper presents DEplain, a new dataset of parallel, professionally written and manually aligned simplifications in plain German (\"plain DE\" or in German: \"Einfache Sprache\"). DEplain consists of a news domain (approx. 500 document pairs, approx. 13k sentence pairs) and a web-domain corpus (approx. 150 aligned documents, approx. 2k aligned sentence pairs). In addition, we are building a web harvester and experimenting with automatic alignment methods to facilitate the integration of non-aligned and to be published parallel documents. Using this approach, we are dynamically increasing the web domain corpus, so it is currently extended to approx. 750 document pairs and approx. 3.5k aligned sentence pairs. We show that using DEplain to train a transformer-based seq2seq text simplification model can achieve promising results. We make available the corpus, the adapted alignment methods for German, the web harvester and the trained models here: https://github.com/rstodden/DEPlain.","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18939v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Large Car-following Data Based on Lyft level-5 Open Dataset: Following Autonomous Vehicles vs. Human-driven Vehicles","abstract":"Car-Following (CF), as a fundamental driving behaviour, has significant influences on the safety and efficiency of traffic flow. Investigating how human drivers react differently when following autonomous vs. human-driven vehicles (HV) is thus critical for mixed traffic flow. Research in this field can be expedited with trajectory datasets collected by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). However, trajectories collected by AVs are noisy and not readily applicable for studying CF behaviour. This paper extracts and enhances two categories of CF data, HV-following-AV (H-A) and HV-following-HV (H-H), from the open Lyft level-5 dataset. First, CF pairs are selected based on specific rules. Next, the quality of raw data is assessed by anomaly analysis. Then, the raw CF data is corrected and enhanced via motion planning, Kalman filtering, and wavelet denoising. As a result, 29k+ H-A and 42k+ H-H car-following segments are obtained, with a total driving distance of 150k+ km. A diversity assessment shows that the processed data cover complete CF regimes for calibrating CF models. This open and ready-to-use dataset provides the opportunity to investigate the CF behaviours of following AVs vs. HVs from real-world data. It can further facilitate studies on exploring the impact of AVs on mixed urban traffic.","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18921v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
{"title":"Password-Based Authentication and The Experiences of End Users","abstract":"Passwords are used majorly for end-user authentication in information and communication technology (ICT) systems due to its perceived ease of use. The use for end-user authentication extends through mobile, computers and network-based products and services. But with the attendant issues relating to password hacks, leakages, and theft largely due to weak, reuse and poor password habits of end-users, the call for passwordless authentication as alternative intensifies. All the same, there are missing knowledge of whether these password-based experiences are associated with societal economic status, educational qualification of citizens, their age and gender, technological advancements, and depth of penetration. In line with the above, understanding the experience of end-users in developing economy to ascertain their password-based experience has become of interest to the researchers. This paper aims at measuring the experience of staff and students in University communities within southeastern Nigeria on password-based authentication systems. These communities have population whose age brackets are majorly within the ages of 16 and 60 years; have people with requisite educational qualifications ranging from Diploma to Doctorate degrees and constitutes good number of ICT tools consumers. The survey had 291 respondents, and collected data about age, educational qualifications, and gender from these respondents. It also collected information about their password experience in social media network, online shopping, electronic health care services, and internet banking. Our analysis using SPSS and report by means of descriptive statistics, frequency distribution, and Chi-Square tests showed that account compromise in the geographical area is not common with the respondents reporting good experience with passwords usage.","created":"2023-05-30","meta":{"link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18909v1","tag":"data-quality"}}
