                  <p>Large language models have shown impressive results for multi-hop mathematical reasoning when the input question is only textual.Many mathematical reasoning problems, however, contain both text and image.With the ever-increasing adoption of vision language models (VLMs), understanding their reasoning abilities for such problems is crucial.In this paper, we evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs along various axes through the lens of geometry problems.We procedurally create a synthetic dataset of geometry questions with controllable difficulty levels along multiple axes, thus enabling a systematic evaluation.The empirical results obtained using our benchmark for state-of-the-art VLMs indicate that these models are not as capable in subjects like geometry (and, by generalization, other topics requiring similar reasoning) as suggested by previous benchmarks.This is made especially clear by the construction of our benchmark at various depth levels, since solving higher-depth problems requires long chains of reasoning rather than additional memorized knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the dataset for further research in this area. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.928</span></span></p>

                  <p>Semi-supervised action segmentation aims to perform frame-wise classification in long untrimmed videos, where only a fraction of videos in the training set have labels.Recent studies have shown the potential of contrastive learning in unsupervised representation learning using unlabelled data.However, learning the representation of each frame by unsupervised contrastive learning for action segmentation remains an open and challenging problem.In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-guided Multi-level Contrast scheme with a Neighbourhood-Consistency-Aware unit (SMC-NCA) to extract strong frame-wise representations for semi-supervised action segmentation.Specifically, for representation learning, SMC is firstly used to explore intra- and inter-information variations in a unified and contrastive way, based on dynamic clustering process of the original input, encoded semantic and temporal features.Then, the NCA module, which is responsible for enforcing spatial consistency between neighbourhoods centered at different frames to alleviate over-segmentation issues, works alongside SMC for semi-supervised learning.Our SMC outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks, offering improvements of up to 17.8% and 12.6% in terms of edit distance and accuracy, respectively.Additionally, the NCA unit results in significant better segmentation performance against the others in the presence of only 5% labelled videos.We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on our Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span></p>

                  <p>Instance shape reconstruction from a 3D scene involves recovering the full geometries of multiple objects at the semantic instance level.Many methods leverage data-driven learning due to the intricacies of scene complexity and significant indoor occlusions.Training these methods often requires a large-scale, high-quality dataset with aligned and paired shape annotations with real-world scans.Existing datasets are either synthetic or misaligned, restricting the performance of data-driven methods on real data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce LASA, a Large-scale Aligned Shape Annotation Dataset comprising 10,412 high-quality CAD annotations aligned with 920 real-world scene scans from ArkitScenes, created manually by professional artists. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span>On this top, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Cross-Modal Shape Reconstruction (DisCo) method.It is empowered by a hybrid feature aggregation design to fuse multi-modal inputs and recover high-fidelity object geometries.Besides, we present an Occupancy-Guided 3D Object Detection (OccGOD) method and demonstrate that our shape annotations provide scene occupancy clues that can further improve 3D object detection.Supported by LASA, extensive experiments show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance in both instance-level scene reconstruction and 3D object detection tasks.</p>

                  <p>Embedding Human and Articulated Object Interaction (HAOI) in 3D is an important direction for a deeper human activity understanding.Different from previous works that use parametric and CAD models to represent humans and objects, in this work, we propose a novel 3D geometric primitive-based language to encode both humans and objects.Given our new paradigm, humans and objects are all compositions of primitives instead of heterogeneous entities.Thus, mutual information learning may be achieved between the limited 3D data of humans and different object categories.Moreover, considering the simplicity of the expression and the richness of the information it contains, we choose the superquadric as the primitive representation.To explore an effective embedding of HAOI for the machine, we build a new benchmark on 3D HAOI consisting of primitives together with their images and propose a task requiring machines to recover 3D HAOI using primitives from images.Moreover, we propose a baseline of single-view 3D reconstruction on HAOI.We believe this primitive-based 3D HAOI representation would pave the way for 3D HAOI studies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at https://mvig-rhos.com/p3haoi. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span></p>

                  <p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) for RGB images has achieved significant success, yet there is still limited research on SSL for infrared images, primarily due to three prominent challenges: 1) the lack of a suitable large-scale infrared pre-training dataset, 2) the distinctiveness of non-iconic infrared images rendering common pre-training tasks like masked image modeling (MIM) less effective, and 3) the scarcity of fine-grained textures making it particularly challenging to learn general image features.To address these issues, we construct a Multi-Scene Infrared Pre-training (MSIP) dataset comprising 178,756 images, and introduce object-sensitive random RoI cropping, an image preprocessing method, to tackle the challenge posed by non-iconic images.To alleviate the impact of weak textures on feature learning, we propose a pre-training paradigm called Pre-training with ADapter (PAD), which uses adapters to learn domain-specific features while freezing parameters pre-trained on ImageNet to retain the general feature extraction capability.This new paradigm is applicable to any transformer-based SSL method.Furthermore, to achieve more flexible coordination between pre-trained and newly-learned features in different layers and patches, a patchwise-scale adapter with dynamically learnable scale factors is introduced.Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks show that PAD, with only 1.23M pre-trainable parameters, outperforms other baseline paradigms including continual full pre-training on MSIP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/casiatao/PAD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span></p>

                  <p>Tool tracking in surgical videos is vital in computer-assisted intervention for tasks like surgeon skill assessment, safety zone estimation, and human-machine collaboration during minimally invasive procedures.The lack of large-scale datasets hampers Artificial Intelligence implementation in this domain.Current datasets exhibit overly generic tracking formalization, often lacking surgical context: a deficiency that becomes evident when tools move out of the camera's scope, resulting in rigid trajectories that hinder realistic surgical representation.This paper addresses the need for a more precise and adaptable tracking formalization tailored to the intricacies of endoscopic procedures by introducing CholecTrack20, an extensive dataset meticulously annotated for multi-class multi-tool tracking across three perspectives representing the various ways of considering the temporal duration of a tool trajectory: (1) intraoperative, (2) intracorporeal, and (3) visibility within the camera's scope.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset comprises 20 laparoscopic videos with over 35,000 frames and 65,000 annotated tool instances with details on spatial location, category, identity, operator, phase, and surgical visual conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span>This detailed dataset caters to the evolving assistive requirements within a procedure.</p>

                  <p>Recently, the evaluation of Large Language Models has emerged as a popular area of research.The three crucial questions for LLM evaluation are ``what, where, and how to evaluate''.However, the existing research mainly focuses on the first two questions, which are basically what tasks to give the LLM during testing and what kind of knowledge it should deal with.As for the third question, which is about what standards to use, the types of evaluators, how to score, and how to rank, there hasn't been much discussion.In this paper, we analyze evaluation methods by comparing various criteria with both manual and automatic evaluation, utilizing onsite, crowd-sourcing, public annotators and GPT-4, with different scoring methods and ranking systems.We propose a new dataset, LLMEval and conduct evaluations on 20 LLMs.A total of 2,186 individuals participated, leading to the generation of 243,337 manual annotations and 57,511 automatic evaluation results.We perform comparisons and analyses of different settings and conduct 10 conclusions that can provide some insights for evaluating LLM in the future.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and the results are publicly available at https://github.com/llmeval . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite significant recent progress in the field of autonomous driving, modern methods still struggle and can incur serious accidents when encountering long-tail unforeseen events and challenging urban scenarios.On the one hand, large language models (LLM) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities that approach "Artificial General Intelligence".On the other hand, previous autonomous driving methods tend to rely on limited-format inputs (e.g. sensor data and navigation waypoints), restricting the vehicle's ability to understand language information and interact with humans.To this end, this paper introduces LMDrive, a novel language-guided, end-to-end, closed-loop autonomous driving framework.LMDrive uniquely processes and integrates multi-modal sensor data with natural language instructions, enabling interaction with humans and navigation software in realistic instructional settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate further research in language-based closed-loop autonomous driving, we also publicly release the corresponding dataset which includes approximately 64K instruction-following data clips, and the LangAuto benchmark that tests the system's ability to handle complex instructions and challenging driving scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.872</span></span>Extensive closed-loop experiments are conducted to demonstrate LMDrive's effectiveness.To the best of our knowledge, we're the very first work to leverage LLMs for closed-loop end-to-end autonomous driving.Codes can be found at https://github.com/opendilab/LMDrive</p>

                  <p>In the present paper, we introduce a new method for the automated generation of residential distribution grid models based on novel building load estimation methods and a two-stage optimization for the generation of the 20 kV and 400 V grid topologies.Using the introduced load estimation methods, various open or proprietary data sources can be utilized to estimate the load of residential buildings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These data sources include available building footprints from OpenStreetMap, 3D building data from OSM Buildings, and the number of electricity meters per address provided by the respective distribution system operator (DSO).    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span>For the evaluation of the introduced methods, we compare the resulting grid models by utilizing different available data sources for a specific suburban residential area and the real grid topology provided by the DSO.This evaluation yields two key findings:First, the automated 20 kV network generation methodology works well when compared to the real network.Second, the utilization of public 3D building data for load estimation significantly increases the resulting model accuracy compared to 2D data and enables results similar to models based on DSO-supplied meter data.This substantially reduces the dependence on such normally proprietary data.</p>

                  <p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools for open-ended image understanding tasks, including open vocabulary segmentation.Yet, direct application of such VLMs to segmentation is non-trivial, since VLMs are trained with image-text pairs and naturally lack pixel-level granularity.Recent works have made advancements in bridging this gap, often by leveraging the shared image-text space in which the image and a provided text prompt are represented.In this paper, we challenge the capabilities of VLMs further and tackle open-vocabulary segmentation without the need for any textual input.To this end, we propose a novel Self-Guided Semantic Segmentation (Self-Seg) framework.Self-Seg is capable of automatically detecting relevant class names from clustered BLIP embeddings and using these for accurate semantic segmentation.In addition, we propose an LLM-based Open-Vocabulary Evaluator (LOVE) to effectively assess predicted open-vocabulary class names.We achieve state-of-the-art results on Pascal VOC, ADE20K and CityScapes for open-vocabulary segmentation without given class names, as well as competitive performance with methods where class names are given.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and data will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the commercial abundance of UAVs, aerial data acquisition remains challenging, and the existing Asia and North America-centric open-source UAV datasets are small-scale or low-resolution and lack diversity in scene contextuality.Additionally, the color content of the scenes, solar-zenith angle, and population density of different geographies influence the data diversity.These two factors conjointly render suboptimal aerial-visual perception of the deep neural network (DNN) models trained primarily on the ground-view data, including the open-world foundational models.   To pave the way for a transformative era of aerial detection, we present Multiview Aerial Visual RECognition or MAVREC, a video dataset where we record synchronized scenes from different perspectives -- ground camera and drone-mounted camera.MAVREC consists of around 2.5 hours of industry-standard 2.7K resolution video sequences, more than 0.5 million frames, and 1.1 million annotated bounding boxes.This makes MAVREC the largest ground and aerial-view dataset, and the fourth largest among all drone-based datasets across all modalities and tasks.Through our extensive benchmarking on MAVREC, we recognize that augmenting object detectors with ground-view images from the corresponding geographical location is a superior pre-training strategy for aerial detection.Building on this strategy, we benchmark MAVREC with a curriculum-based semi-supervised object detection approach that leverages labeled (ground and aerial) and unlabeled (only aerial) images to enhance the aerial detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We publicly release the MAVREC dataset: https://mavrec.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>In modern machine learning, the trend of harnessing self-supervised learning to derive high-quality representations without label dependency has garnered significant attention.However, the absence of label information, coupled with the inherently high-dimensional nature, improves the difficulty for the interpretation of learned representations.Consequently, indirect evaluations become the popular metric for evaluating the quality of these features, leading to a biased validation of the learned representation rationale.To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Concept-based Explainable Image Representation (CEIR).Initially, using the Concept-based Model (CBM) incorporated with pretrained CLIP and concepts generated by GPT-4, we project input images into a concept vector space.Subsequently, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) learns the latent representation from these projected concepts, which serves as the final image representation.Due to the capability of the representation to encapsulate high-level, semantically relevant concepts, the model allows for attributions to a human-comprehensible concept space.This not only enhances interpretability but also preserves the robustness essential for downstream tasks.For instance, our method exhibits state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering performance on benchmarks such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10.Furthermore, capitalizing on the universality of human conceptual understanding, CEIR can seamlessly extract the related concept from open-world images without fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This offers a fresh approach to automatic label generation and label manipulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD) based on deep learning has proven to be an effective and flexible solution, attracting extensive research.Deep neural networks can learn rich representations from vast amounts of representative labeled data for various applications.In IFD, they achieve high classification performance from signals in an end-to-end manner, without requiring extensive domain knowledge.However, deep learning models usually only perform well on the data distribution they have been trained on.When applied to a different distribution, they may experience performance drops.This is also observed in IFD, where assets are often operated in working conditions different from those in which labeled data have been collected.Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) deals with the scenario where labeled data are available in a source domain, and only unlabeled data are available in a target domain, where domains may correspond to operating conditions.Recent methods rely on training with confident pseudo-labels for target samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the confidence-based selection of pseudo-labels is hindered by poorly calibrated confidence estimates in the target domain, primarily due to over-confident predictions, which limits the quality of pseudo-labels and leads to error accumulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>In this paper, we propose a novel UDA method called Calibrated Adaptive Teacher (CAT), where we propose to calibrate the predictions of the teacher network throughout the self-training process, leveraging post-hoc calibration techniques.We evaluate CAT on domain-adaptive IFD and perform extensive experiments on the Paderborn benchmark for bearing fault diagnosis under varying operating conditions.Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most transfer tasks.</p>

                  <p>Sequential recommendation aims to infer user preferences from historical interaction sequences and predict the next item that users may be interested in the future.The current mainstream design approach is to represent items as fixed vectors, capturing the underlying relationships between items and user preferences based on the order of interactions.However, relying on a single fixed-item embedding may weaken the modeling capability of the system, and the global dynamics and local saliency exhibited by user preferences need to be distinguished.To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel diffusion recommendation algorithm based on multi-scale cnn and residual lstm (AREAL).We introduce diffusion models into the recommend system, representing items as probability distributions instead of fixed vectors.This approach enables adaptive reflection of multiple aspects of the items and generates item distributions in a denoising manner.We use multi-scale cnn and residual lstm methods to extract the local and global dependency features of user history interactions, and use attention mechanism to distinguish weights as the guide features of reverse diffusion recovery.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments conducted on two real-world datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, AREAL obtains improvements over the best baselines by 2.63% and 4.25% in terms of HR@20 and 5.05% and 3.94% in terms of NDCG@20 on all datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>High-resolution representation is essential for achieving good performance in human pose estimation models.To obtain such features, existing works utilize high-resolution input images or fine-grained image tokens.However, this dense high-resolution representation brings a significant computational burden.In this paper, we address the following question: "Only sparse human keypoint locations are detected for human pose estimation, is it really necessary to describe the whole image in a dense, high-resolution manner?"Based on dynamic transformer models, we propose a framework that only uses Sparse High-resolution Representations for human Pose estimation (SHaRPose).In detail, SHaRPose consists of two stages.At the coarse stage, the relations between image regions and keypoints are dynamically mined while a coarse estimation is generated.Then, a quality predictor is applied to decide whether the coarse estimation results should be refined.At the fine stage, SHaRPose builds sparse high-resolution representations only on the regions related to the keypoints and provides refined high-precision human pose estimations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, compared to the state-of-the-art method ViTPose, our model SHaRPose-Base achieves 77.4 AP (+0.5 AP) on the COCO validation set and 76.7 AP (+0.5 AP) on the COCO test-dev set, and infers at a speed of $1.4\times$ faster than ViTPose-Base. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span></p>

                  <p>Constraint Programming (CP) has been successfully used to model and solve complex combinatorial problems.However, modeling is often not trivial and requires expertise, which is a bottleneck to wider adoption.In Constraint Acquisition (CA), the goal is to assist the user by automatically learning the model.In (inter)active CA, this is done by interactively posting queries to the user, e.g., asking whether a partial solution satisfies their (unspecified) constraints or not.While interac tive CA methods learn the constraints, the learning is related to symbolic concept learning, as the goal is to learn an exact representation.However, a large number of queries is still required to learn the model, which is a major limitation.In this paper, we aim to alleviate this limitation by tightening the connection of CA and Machine Learning (ML), by, for the first time in interactive CA, exploiting statistical ML methods.We propose to use probabilistic classification models to guide interactive CA to generate more promising queries.We discuss how to train classifiers to predict whether a candidate expression from the bias is a constraint of the problem or not, using both relation-based and scope-based features.We then show how the predictions can be used in all layers of interactive CA: the query generation, the scope finding, and the lowest-level constraint finding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We experimentally evaluate our proposed methods using different classifiers and show that our methods greatly outperform the state of the art, decreasing the number of queries needed to converge by up to 72%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the development of large pre-trained vision-language models, how to effectively transfer the knowledge of such foundational models to downstream tasks becomes a hot topic, especially in a data-deficient scenario.Recently, prompt tuning has become a popular solution.When adapting the vision-language models, researchers freeze the parameters in the backbone and only design and tune the prompts.On the one hand, the delicate design of prompt tuning exhibits strong performance.On the other hand, complicated structures and update rules largely increase the computation and storage cost.Motivated by the observation that the evolution pattern of the generalization capability in visual-language models aligns harmoniously with the trend of rank variations in the prompt matrix during adaptation, we design a new type of prompt, Re-parameterized Low-rank Prompt (RLP), for both efficient and effective adaptation.Our method could largely reduce the number of tunable parameters and storage space, which is quite beneficial in resource-limited scenarios.Extensive experiments further demonstrate the superiority of RLP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, RLP shows comparable or even stronger performance than the latest state-of-the-art methods with an extremely small number of parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>On a series of tasks over 11 datasets, RLP significantly increases the average downstream accuracy of classic prompt tuning by up to 5.25% using merely 0.5K parameters.</p>

                  <p>The substantial success of Vision Transformer (ViT) in computer vision tasks is largely attributed to the architecture design.This underscores the necessity of efficient architecture search for designing better ViTs automatically.As training-based architecture search methods are computationally intensive, there is a growing interest in training-free methods that use zero-cost proxies to score ViTs.However, existing training-free approaches require expert knowledge to manually design specific zero-cost proxies.Moreover, these zero-cost proxies exhibit limitations to generalize across diverse domains.In this paper, we introduce Auto-Prox, an automatic proxy discovery framework, to address the problem.First, we build the ViT-Bench-101, which involves different ViT candidates and their actual performance on multiple datasets.Utilizing ViT-Bench-101, we can evaluate zero-cost proxies based on their score-accuracy correlation.Then, we represent zero-cost proxies with computation graphs and organize the zero-cost proxy search space with ViT statistics and primitive operations.To discover generic zero-cost proxies, we propose a joint correlation metric to evolve and mutate different zero-cost proxy candidates.We introduce an elitism-preserve strategy for search efficiency to achieve a better trade-off between exploitation and exploration.Based on the discovered zero-cost proxy, we conduct a ViT architecture search in a training-free manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generalizes well to different datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results both in ranking correlation and final accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>Codes can be found at https://github.com/lilujunai/Auto-Prox-AAAI24.</p>

We then propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm whose outputs are provably no worse than those of the trivial algorithm, but often substantially better.A family of problem instances is presented for which our improved algorithm produces optimal solutions, while, for any $\varepsilon$, the trivial algorithm can\emph{not}\/ attain a $(2-\varepsilon)$-approximation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results may lead to the first polynomial-time approximation algorithm that solves the CP-net aggregation problem for swaps with an approximation ratio substantially better than $2$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep learning models are known to suffer from the problem of bias, and researchers have been exploring methods to address this issue.However, most of these methods require prior knowledge of the bias and are not always practical.In this paper, we focus on a more practical setting with no prior information about the bias.Generally, in this setting, there are a large number of bias-aligned samples that cause the model to produce biased predictions and a few bias-conflicting samples that do not conform to the bias.If the training data is limited, the influence of the bias-aligned samples may become even stronger on the model predictions, and we experimentally demonstrate that existing debiasing techniques suffer severely in such cases.In this paper, we examine the effects of unknown bias in small dataset regimes and present a novel approach to mitigate this issue.The proposed approach directly addresses the issue of the extremely low occurrence of bias-conflicting samples in limited data settings through the synthesis of hybrid samples that can be used to reduce the effect of bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in addressing any unknown bias in the presence of limited data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, our approach outperforms the vanilla, LfF, LDD, and DebiAN debiasing methods by absolute margins of 10.39%, 9.08%, 8.07%, and 9.67% when only 10% of the Corrupted CIFAR-10 Type 1 dataset is available with a bias-conflicting sample ratio of 0.05. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human Pose and Shape Estimation (HPSE) from RGB images can be broadly categorized into two main groups: parametric and non-parametric approaches.Parametric techniques leverage a low-dimensional statistical body model for realistic results, whereas recent non-parametric methods achieve higher precision by directly regressing the 3D coordinates of the human body.Despite their strengths, both approaches face limitations: the parameters of statistical body models pose challenges as regression targets, and predicting 3D coordinates introduces computational complexities and issues related to smoothness.In this work, we take a novel approach to address the HPSE problem.We introduce a unique method involving a low-dimensional discrete latent representation of the human mesh, framing HPSE as a classification task.Instead of predicting body model parameters or 3D vertex coordinates, our focus is on forecasting the proposed discrete latent representation, which can be decoded into a registered human mesh.This innovative paradigm offers two key advantages: firstly, predicting a low-dimensional discrete representation confines our predictions to the space of anthropomorphic poses and shapes; secondly, by framing the problem as a classification task, we can harness the discriminative power inherent in neural networks.Our proposed model, VQ-HPS, a transformer-based architecture, forecasts the discrete latent representation of the mesh, trained through minimizing a cross-entropy loss.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that VQ-HPS outperforms the current state-of-the-art non-parametric approaches while yielding results as realistic as those produced by parametric methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>This highlights the significant potential of the classification approach for HPSE.</p>

                  <p>Dynamic analysis methods effectively identify shelled, wrapped, or obfuscated malware, thereby preventing them from invading computers.As a significant representation of dynamic malware behavior, the API (Application Programming Interface) sequence, comprised of consecutive API calls, has progressively become the dominant feature of dynamic analysis methods.Though there have been numerous deep learning models for malware detection based on API sequences, the quality of API call representations produced by those models is limited.These models cannot generate representations for unknown API calls, which weakens both the detection performance and the generalization.Further, the concept drift phenomenon of API calls is prominent.To tackle these issues, we introduce a prompt engineering-assisted malware dynamic analysis using GPT-4.In this method, GPT-4 is employed to create explanatory text for each API call within the API sequence.Afterward, the pre-trained language model BERT is used to obtain the representation of the text, from which we derive the representation of the API sequence.Theoretically, this proposed method is capable of generating representations for all API calls, excluding the necessity for dataset training during the generation process.Utilizing the representation, a CNN-based detection model is designed to extract the feature.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We adopt five benchmark datasets to validate the performance of the proposed model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>The experimental results reveal that the proposed detection algorithm performs better than the state-of-the-art method (TextCNN).Specifically, in cross-database experiments and few-shot learning experiments, the proposed model achieves excellent detection performance and almost a 100% recall rate for malware, verifying its superior generalization performance.The code is available at: github.com/yan-scnu/Prompted_Dynamic_Detection.</p>

                  <p>In practice, preference learning from human feedback depends on incomplete data with hidden context.Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model.This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria.We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called Borda count.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function.A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF.As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference learning (DPL).DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context.Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/hidden-context</p>

                  <p>Albeit progress has been made in Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), we empirically find that a certain percentage of failure retrieval results are not consistent with their relative captions.To address this issue, this work provides a Visual Question Answering (VQA) perspective to boost the performance of CIR.The resulting VQA4CIR is a post-processing approach and can be directly plugged into existing CIR methods.Given the top-C retrieved images by a CIR method, VQA4CIR aims to decrease the adverse effect of the failure retrieval results being inconsistent with the relative caption.To find the retrieved images inconsistent with the relative caption, we resort to the "QA generation to VQA" self-verification pipeline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For QA generation, we suggest fine-tuning LLM (e.g., LLaMA) to generate several pairs of questions and answers from each relative caption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>We then fine-tune LVLM (e.g., LLaVA) to obtain the VQA model.By feeding the retrieved image and question to the VQA model, one can find the images inconsistent with relative caption when the answer by VQA is inconsistent with the answer in the QA pair.Consequently, the CIR performance can be boosted by modifying the ranks of inconsistently retrieved images.Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CIR methods on the CIRR and Fashion-IQ datasets.</p>

                  <p>Recently, 3D understanding has become popular to facilitate autonomous agents to perform further decisionmaking.However, existing 3D datasets and methods are often limited to specific tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the other hand, recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) have demonstrated exceptional general language and imagery tasking performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Therefore, it is interesting to unlock MLM's potential to be 3D generalist for wider tasks.However, current MLMs' research has been less focused on 3D tasks due to a lack of large-scale 3D instruction-following datasets.In this work, we introduce a comprehensive 3D instructionfollowing dataset called M3DBench, which possesses the following characteristics: 1) It supports general multimodal instructions interleaved with text, images, 3D objects, and other visual prompts.2) It unifies diverse 3D tasks at both region and scene levels, covering a variety of fundamental abilities in real-world 3D environments.3) It is a large-scale 3D instruction-following dataset with over 320k instruction-response pairs.Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark for assessing the performance of large models in understanding multi-modal 3D prompts.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and baseline, supporting general 3D-centric tasks, which can inspire future research.</p>

In this work, we propose JailGuard, the first mutation-based jailbreaking detection framework which supports both image and text modalities.Our key observation is that attack queries inherently possess less robustness compared to benign queries.Specifically, to confuse the model, attack queries are usually crafted with well-designed templates or complicate perturbations, leading to a fact that a slight disturbance in input may result in a drastic change in the response.This lack of robustness can be utilized in attack detection.Based on this intuition, we designed and implemented a detection framework comprising 19 different mutators and a divergence-based detection formula.To fully understand the effectiveness of our framework, we built the first multi-modal LLM jailbreaking attack dataset, which has 304 items of data, covering ten types of known jailbreaking attacks on image and text modalities.The evaluation suggests that JailGuard achieves the best detection accuracy of 89.38%/85.42% on image and text inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art defense methods by 15.28%.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning with knowledge graphs (KGs) has primarily focused on triple-shaped facts.Recent advancements have been explored to enhance the semantics of these facts by incorporating more potent representations, such as hyper-relational facts.However, these approaches are limited to \emph{atomic facts}, which describe a single piece of information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper extends beyond \emph{atomic facts} and delves into \emph{nested facts}, represented by quoted triples where subjects and objects are triples themselves (e.g., ((\emph{BarackObama}, \emph{holds\_position}, \emph{President}), \emph{succeed\_by}, (\emph{DonaldTrump}, \emph{holds\_position}, \emph{President}))). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>These nested facts enable the expression of complex semantics like \emph{situations} over time and \emph{logical patterns} over entities and relations.In response, we introduce NestE, a novel KG embedding approach that captures the semantics of both atomic and nested factual knowledge.NestE represents each atomic fact as a $1\times3$ matrix, and each nested relation is modeled as a $3\times3$ matrix that rotates the $1\times3$ atomic fact matrix through matrix multiplication.Each element of the matrix is represented as a complex number in the generalized 4D hypercomplex space, including (spherical) quaternions, hyperbolic quaternions, and split-quaternions.Through thorough analysis, we demonstrate the embedding's efficacy in capturing diverse logical patterns over nested facts, surpassing the confines of first-order logic-like expressions.Our experimental results showcase NestE's significant performance gains over current baselines in triple prediction and conditional link prediction.The code and pre-trained models are open available at https://github.com/xiongbo010/NestE.</p>

                  <p>Worked examples (solutions to typical programming problems presented as a source code in a certain language and are used to explain the topics from a programming class) are among the most popular types of learning content in programming classes.Most approaches and tools for presenting these examples to students are based on line-by-line explanations of the example code.However, instructors rarely have time to provide line-by-line explanations for a large number of examples typically used in a programming class.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we explore and assess a human-AI collaboration approach to authoring worked examples for Java programming. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>We introduce an authoring system for creating Java worked examples that generates a starting version of code explanations and presents it to the instructor to edit if necessary.We also present a study that assesses the quality of explanations created with this approach.</p>
