                  <p>Sharing knowledge between information extraction tasks has always been a challenge due to the diverse data formats and task variations.Meanwhile, this divergence leads to information waste and increases difficulties in building complex applications in real scenarios.Recent studies often formulate IE tasks as a triplet extraction problem.However, such a paradigm does not support multi-span and n-ary extraction, leading to weak versatility.To this end, we reorganize IE problems into unified multi-slot tuples and propose a universal framework for various IE tasks, namely Mirror.Specifically, we recast existing IE tasks as a multi-span cyclic graph extraction problem and devise a non-autoregressive graph decoding algorithm to extract all spans in a single step.It is worth noting that this graph structure is incredibly versatile, and it supports not only complex IE tasks, but also machine reading comprehension and classification tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We manually construct a corpus containing 57 datasets for model pretraining, and conduct experiments on 30 datasets across 8 downstream tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span>The experimental results demonstrate that our model has decent compatibility and outperforms or reaches competitive performance with SOTA systems under few-shot and zero-shot settings.The code, model weights, and pretraining corpus are available at https://github.com/Spico197/Mirror .</p>

                  <p>3D content creation via text-driven stylization has played a fundamental challenge to multimedia and graphics community.Recent advances of cross-modal foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have made this problem feasible.Those approaches commonly leverage CLIP to align the holistic semantics of stylized mesh with the given text prompt.Nevertheless, it is not trivial to enable more controllable stylization of fine-grained details in 3D meshes solely based on such semantic-level cross-modal supervision.In this work, we propose a new 3DStyle-Diffusion model that triggers fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes with additional controllable appearance and geometric guidance from 2D Diffusion models.Technically, 3DStyle-Diffusion first parameterizes the texture of 3D mesh into reflectance properties and scene lighting using implicit MLP networks.Meanwhile, an accurate depth map of each sampled view is achieved conditioned on 3D mesh.Then, 3DStyle-Diffusion leverages a pre-trained controllable 2D Diffusion model to guide the learning of rendered images, encouraging the synthesized image of each view semantically aligned with text prompt and geometrically consistent with depth map.This way elegantly integrates both image rendering via implicit MLP networks and diffusion process of image synthesis in an end-to-end fashion, enabling a high-quality fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also build a new dataset derived from Objaverse and the evaluation protocol for this task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we validate the capability of our 3DStyle-Diffusion.Source code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/yanghb22-fdu/3DStyle-Diffusion-Official}.</p>

                  <p>Recently proposed long-form question answering (QA) systems, supported by large language models (LLMs), have shown promising capabilities.Yet, attributing and verifying their generated abstractive answers can be difficult, and automatically evaluating their accuracy remains an ongoing challenge.   In this work, we introduce a new QA task for answering multi-answer questions by summarizing multiple diverse sources in a semi-extractive fashion.Specifically, Semi-extractive Multi-source QA (SEMQA) requires models to output a comprehensive answer, while mixing factual quoted spans -- copied verbatim from given input sources -- and non-factual free-text connectors that glue these spans together into a single cohesive passage.This setting bridges the gap between the outputs of well-grounded but constrained extractive QA systems and more fluent but harder to attribute fully abstractive answers.Particularly, it enables a new mode for language models that leverages their advanced language generation capabilities, while also producing fine in-line attributions by-design that are easy to verify, interpret, and evaluate.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To study this task, we create the first dataset of this kind, QuoteSum, with human-written semi-extractive answers to natural and generated questions, and define text-based evaluation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span>Experimenting with several LLMs in various settings, we find this task to be surprisingly challenging, demonstrating the importance of QuoteSum for developing and studying such consolidation capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Recent works have showcased the ability of large-scale language models (LLMs) to embody diverse personas in their responses, exemplified by prompts like 'You are Yoda.Explain the Theory of Relativity.'While this ability allows personalization of LLMs and enables human behavior simulation, its effect on LLMs' capabilities remain unclear.To fill this gap, we present the first extensive study of the unintended side-effects of persona assignment on the ability of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, to perform basic reasoning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study covers 24 reasoning datasets and 16 diverse personas spanning 5 socio-demographic groups: race, gender, religion, disability, and political affiliation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span>Our experiments unveil that ChatGPT carries deep rooted bias against various socio-demographics underneath a veneer of fairness.While it overtly rejects stereotypes when explicitly asked ('Are Black people less skilled at mathematics?'), it manifests stereotypical and often erroneous presumptions when prompted to answer questions while taking on a persona.These can be observed as abstentions in the model responses, e.g., 'As a Black person, I am unable to answer this question as it requires math knowledge', and generally result in a substantial drop in performance on reasoning tasks.We find that this inherent deep bias is ubiquitous - 80% of our personas demonstrated bias; it is significant - certain datasets had relative drops in performance of 70%+; and can be especially harmful for certain groups - certain personas had stat.sign.drops on more than 80% of the datasets.Further analysis shows that these persona-induced errors can be hard-to-discern and hard-to-avoid.Our findings serve as a cautionary tale that the practice of assigning personas to LLMs - a trend on the rise - can surface their deep-rooted biases and have unforeseeable and detrimental side-effects.</p>

                  <p>Recently, pretrained language models have shown state-of-the-art performance on the vulnerability detection task.These models are pretrained on a large corpus of source code, then fine-tuned on a smaller supervised vulnerability dataset.Due to the different training objectives and the performance of the models, it is interesting to consider whether the models have learned the semantics of code relevant to vulnerability detection, namely bug semantics, and if so, how the alignment to bug semantics relates to model performance.In this paper, we analyze the models using three distinct methods: interpretability tools, attention analysis, and interaction matrix analysis.We compare the models' influential feature sets with the bug semantic features which define the causes of bugs, including buggy paths and Potentially Vulnerable Statements (PVS).We find that (1) better-performing models also aligned better with PVS, (2) the models failed to align strongly to PVS, and (3) the models failed to align at all to buggy paths.Based on our analysis, we developed two annotation methods which highlight the bug semantics inside the model's inputs.We evaluated our approach on four distinct transformer models and four vulnerability datasets and found that our annotations improved the models' performance in the majority of settings - 11 out of 16, with up to 9.57 points improvement in F1 score compared to conventional fine-tuning.We further found that with our annotations, the models aligned up to 232% better to potentially vulnerable statements.Our findings indicate that it is helpful to provide the model with information of the bug semantics, that the model can attend to it, and motivate future work in learning more complex path-based bug semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at https://figshare.com/s/4a16a528d6874aad51a0. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human biases are ubiquitous but not uniform: disparities exist across linguistic, cultural, and societal borders.As large amounts of recent literature suggest, language models (LMs) trained on human data can reflect and often amplify the effects of these social biases.However, the vast majority of existing studies on bias are heavily skewed towards Western and European languages.In this work, we scale the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) to 24 languages, enabling broader studies and yielding interesting findings about LM bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We additionally enhance this data with culturally relevant information for each language, capturing local contexts on a global scale. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>Further, to encompass more widely prevalent societal biases, we examine new bias dimensions across toxicity, ableism, and more.Moreover, we delve deeper into the Indian linguistic landscape, conducting a comprehensive regional bias analysis across six prevalent Indian languages.Finally, we highlight the significance of these social biases and the new dimensions through an extensive comparison of embedding methods, reinforcing the need to address them in pursuit of more equitable language models.All code, data and results are available here: https://github.com/iamshnoo/weathub.</p>

                  <p>Data contamination in language model evaluation is increasingly prevalent as the popularity of large language models.It allows models to "cheat" via memorisation instead of displaying true capabilities.Therefore, contamination analysis has became an crucial part of reliable model evaluation to validate results.However, existing contamination analysis is usually conducted internally by LLM developers and often lacks transparency and completeness.This paper present an open source data contamination reports for the Llama series models.We analyse six popular multi-choice QA benchmarks and quantify their overlapping with the training set of Llama.Various levels of contamination ranging from 1\% to 8.7\% are found across benchmarks.Our comparison also reveals that Llama models can gain over 5\% higher accuracy on contaminated subsets versus clean subsets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data and code are available at: https://github.com/liyucheng09/Contamination_Detector. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, pretrained language models have shown state-of-the-art performance on the vulnerability detection task.These models are pretrained on a large corpus of source code, then fine-tuned on a smaller supervised vulnerability dataset.Due to the different training objectives and the performance of the models, it is interesting to consider whether the models have learned the semantics of code relevant to vulnerability detection, namely bug semantics, and if so, how the alignment to bug semantics relates to model performance.In this paper, we analyze the models using three distinct methods: interpretability tools, attention analysis, and interaction matrix analysis.We compare the models' influential feature sets with the bug semantic features which define the causes of bugs, including buggy paths and Potentially Vulnerable Statements (PVS).We find that (1) better-performing models also aligned better with PVS, (2) the models failed to align strongly to PVS, and (3) the models failed to align at all to buggy paths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on our analysis, we developed two annotation methods which highlight the bug semantics inside the model's inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>We evaluated our approach on four distinct transformer models and four vulnerability datasets and found that our annotations improved the models' performance in the majority of settings - 11 out of 16, with up to 9.57 points improvement in F1 score compared to conventional fine-tuning.We further found that with our annotations, the models aligned up to 232% better to potentially vulnerable statements.Our findings indicate that it is helpful to provide the model with information of the bug semantics, that the model can attend to it, and motivate future work in learning more complex path-based bug semantics.Our code and data are available at https://figshare.com/s/4a16a528d6874aad51a0.</p>

                  <p>Current approaches for collision avoidance and space traffic management face many challenges, mainly due to the continuous increase in the number of objects in orbit and the lack of scalable and automated solutions.To avoid catastrophic incidents, satellite owners/operators must be aware of their assets' collision risk to decide whether a collision avoidance manoeuvre needs to be performed.This process is typically executed through the use of warnings issued in the form of CDMs which contain information about the event, such as the expected TCA and the probability of collision.Our previous work presented a statistical learning model that allowed us to answer two important questions: (1) Will any new conjunctions be issued in the next specified time interval?(2) When and with what uncertainty will the next CDM arrive?However, the model was based on an empirical Bayes homogeneous Poisson process, which assumes that the arrival rates of CDMs are constant over time.In fact, the rate at which the CDMs are issued depends on the behaviour of the objects as well as on the screening process performed by third parties.Thus, in this work, we extend the previous study and propose a Bayesian non-homogeneous Poisson process implemented with high precision using a Probabilistic Programming Language to fully describe the underlying phenomena.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare the proposed solution with a baseline model to demonstrate the added value of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>The results show that this problem can be successfully modelled by our Bayesian non-homogeneous Poisson Process with greater accuracy, contributing to the development of automated collision avoidance systems and helping operators react timely but sparingly with satellite manoeuvres.</p>

                  <p>Mixup refers to interpolation-based data augmentation, originally motivated as a way to go beyond empirical risk minimization (ERM).Its extensions mostly focus on the definition of interpolation and the space (input or feature) where it takes place, while the augmentation process itself is less studied.In most methods, the number of generated examples is limited to the mini-batch size and the number of examples being interpolated is limited to two (pairs), in the input space.   We make progress in this direction by introducing MultiMix, which generates an arbitrarily large number of interpolated examples beyond the mini-batch size and interpolates the entire mini-batch in the embedding space.Effectively, we sample on the entire convex hull of the mini-batch rather than along linear segments between pairs of examples.   On sequence data, we further extend to Dense MultiMix.We densely interpolate features and target labels at each spatial location and also apply the loss densely.To mitigate the lack of dense labels, we inherit labels from examples and weight interpolation factors by attention as a measure of confidence.   Overall, we increase the number of loss terms per mini-batch by orders of magnitude at little additional cost.This is only possible because of interpolating in the embedding space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We empirically show that our solutions yield significant improvement over state-of-the-art mixup methods on four different benchmarks, despite interpolation being only linear. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>By analyzing the embedding space, we show that the classes are more tightly clustered and uniformly spread over the embedding space, thereby explaining the improved behavior.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, computer vision has transformed fields such as medical imaging, object recognition, and geospatial analytics.One of the fundamental tasks in computer vision is semantic image segmentation, which is vital for precise object delineation.Autonomous driving represents one of the key areas where computer vision algorithms are applied.The task of road surface segmentation is crucial in self-driving systems, but it requires a labor-intensive annotation process in several data domains.The work described in this paper aims to improve the efficiency of image segmentation using a convolutional neural network in a multi-sensor setup.This approach leverages lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) annotations to directly train image segmentation models on RGB images.Lidar supplements the images by emitting laser pulses and measuring reflections to provide depth information.However, lidar's sparse point clouds often create difficulties for accurate object segmentation.Segmentation of point clouds requires time-consuming preliminary data preparation and a large amount of computational resources.The key innovation of our approach is the masked loss, addressing sparse ground-truth masks from point clouds.By calculating loss exclusively where lidar points exist, the model learns road segmentation on images by using lidar points as ground truth.This approach allows for blending of different ground-truth data types during model training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental validation of the approach on benchmark datasets shows comparable performance to a high-quality image segmentation model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Incorporating lidar reduces the load on annotations and enables training of image-segmentation models without loss of segmentation quality.The methodology is tested on diverse datasets, both publicly available and proprietary.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method are also discussed in the paper. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span></p>

                  <p>Tucker decomposition is a powerful tensor model to handle multi-aspect data.It demonstrates the low-rank property by decomposing the grid-structured data as interactions between a core tensor and a set of object representations (factors).A fundamental assumption of such decomposition is that there were finite objects in each aspect or mode, corresponding to discrete indexes of data entries.However, many real-world data are not naturally posed in the setting.For example, geographic data is represented as continuous indexes of latitude and longitude coordinates, and cannot fit tensor models directly.To generalize Tucker decomposition to such scenarios, we propose Functional Bayesian Tucker Decomposition (FunBaT).We treat the continuous-indexed data as the interaction between the Tucker core and a group of latent functions.We use Gaussian processes (GP) as functional priors to model the latent functions, and then convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE) to reduce computational cost.An efficient inference algorithm is further developed for scalable posterior approximation based on advanced message-passing techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The advantage of our method is shown in both synthetic data and several real-world applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>Alignment with human preference is a desired property of large language models (LLMs).Currently, the main alignment approach is based on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).Despite the effectiveness of RLHF, it is intricate to implement and train, thus recent studies explore how to develop alternative alignment approaches based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT).A major limitation of SFT is that it essentially does imitation learning, which cannot fully understand what are the expected behaviors.To address this issue, we propose an improved alignment approach named FIGA.Different from prior methods, we incorporate fine-grained (i.e., token or phrase level) quality signals that are derived by contrasting good and bad responses.Our approach has made two major contributions.Firstly, we curate a refined alignment dataset that pairs initial responses and the corresponding revised ones.Secondly, we devise a new loss function can leverage fine-grained quality signals to instruct the learning of LLMs for alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approaches by comparing a number of competitive baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we propose a randomized $\tilde{O}(\Mmax)$-round algorithm for the maximum cardinality matching problem in the CONGEST model, where $\Mmax$ means the maximum size of a matching of the input graph $G$.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed algorithm substantially improves the current best worst-case running time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>The key technical ingredient is a new randomized algorithm of finding an augmenting path of length $\ell$ with high probability within $\tilde{O}(\ell)$ rounds, which positively settles an open problem left in the prior work by Ahmadi and Kuhn [DISC'20].   The idea of our augmenting path algorithm is based on a recent result by Kitamura and Izumi[IEICE Trans.'22], which efficiently identifies a sparse substructure of the input graph containing an augmenting path, following a new concept called \emph{alternating base trees}.Their algorithm, however, resorts to a centralized approach of collecting the entire information of the substructure into a single vertex for constructing an augmenting path.The technical highlight of this paper is to provide a fully-decentralized counterpart of such a centralized method.To develop the algorithm, we prove several new structural properties of alternating base trees, which are of independent interest.</p>

                  <p>In contrast to regular (simple) networks, hyper networks possess the ability to depict more complex relationships among nodes and store extensive information.Such networks are commonly found in real-world applications, such as in social interactions.Learning embedded representations for nodes involves a process that translates network structures into more simplified spaces, thereby enabling the application of machine learning approaches designed for vector data to be extended to network data.Nevertheless, there remains a need to delve into methods for learning embedded representations that prioritize structural aspects.This research introduces HyperS2V, a node embedding approach that centers on the structural similarity within hyper networks.Initially, we establish the concept of hyper-degrees to capture the structural properties of nodes within hyper networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, a novel function is formulated to measure the structural similarity between different hyper-degree values. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Lastly, we generate structural embeddings utilizing a multi-scale random walk framework.Moreover, a series of experiments, both intrinsic and extrinsic, are performed on both toy and real networks.The results underscore the superior performance of HyperS2V in terms of both interpretability and applicability to downstream tasks.</p>

                  <p>Combining offline and online reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for efficient and safe learning.However, previous approaches treat offline and online learning as separate procedures, resulting in redundant designs and limited performance.We ask: Can we achieve straightforward yet effective offline and online learning without introducing extra conservatism or regularization?In this study, we propose Uni-o4, which utilizes an on-policy objective for both offline and online learning.Owning to the alignment of objectives in two phases, the RL agent can transfer between offline and online learning seamlessly.This property enhances the flexibility of the learning paradigm, allowing for arbitrary combinations of pretraining, fine-tuning, offline, and online learning.In the offline phase, specifically, Uni-o4 leverages diverse ensemble policies to address the mismatch issues between the estimated behavior policy and the offline dataset.Through a simple offline policy evaluation (OPE) approach, Uni-o4 can achieve multi-step policy improvement safely.We demonstrate that by employing the method above, the fusion of these two paradigms can yield superior offline initialization as well as stable and rapid online fine-tuning capabilities.Through real-world robot tasks, we highlight the benefits of this paradigm for rapid deployment in challenging, previously unseen real-world environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, through comprehensive evaluations using numerous simulated benchmarks, we substantiate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Our website: https://lei-kun.github.io/uni-o4/ .</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we highlight a problem of evaluation metrics adopted in the open-vocabulary segmentation.That is, the evaluation process still heavily relies on closed-set metrics on zero-shot or cross-dataset pipelines without considering the similarity between predicted and ground truth categories.To tackle this issue, we first survey eleven similarity measurements between two categorical words using WordNet linguistics statistics, text embedding, and language models by comprehensive quantitative analysis and user study.Built upon those explored measurements, we designed novel evaluation metrics, namely Open mIoU, Open AP, and Open PQ, tailored for three open-vocabulary segmentation tasks.We benchmarked the proposed evaluation metrics on 12 open-vocabulary methods of three segmentation tasks.Even though the relative subjectivity of similarity distance, we demonstrate that our metrics can still well evaluate the open ability of the existing open-vocabulary segmentation methods.We hope that our work can bring with the community new thinking about how to evaluate the open ability of models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation code is released in github. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span></p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent works have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) could empower traditional neuro-symbolic models via programming capabilities to translate language into module descriptions, thus achieving strong visual reasoning results while maintaining the model's transparency and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>However, these models usually exhaustively generate the entire code snippet given each new instance of a task, which is extremely ineffective.We propose generative neuro-symbolic visual reasoning by growing and reusing modules.Specifically, our model consists of three unique stages, module initialization, module generation, and module execution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, given a vision-language task, we adopt LLMs to examine whether we could reuse and grow over established modules to handle this new task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>If not, we initialize a new module needed by the task and specify the inputs and outputs of this new module.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>After that, the new module is created by querying LLMs to generate corresponding code snippets that match the requirements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>In order to get a better sense of the new module's ability, we treat few-shot training examples as test cases to see if our new module could pass these cases.If yes, the new module is added to the module library for future reuse.Finally, we evaluate the performance of our model on the testing set by executing the parsed programs with the newly made visual modules to get the results.We find the proposed model possesses several advantages.First, it performs competitively on standard tasks like visual question answering and referring expression comprehension; Second, the modules learned from one task can be seamlessly transferred to new tasks; Last but not least, it is able to adapt to new visual reasoning tasks by observing a few training examples and reusing modules.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Usually, programming languages have official documentation to guide developers with APIs, methods, and classes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>However, researchers identified insufficient or inadequate documentation examples and flaws with the API's complex structure as barriers to learning an API.As a result, developers may consult other sources (StackOverflow, GitHub, etc.) to learn more about an API.Recent research studies have shown that unofficial documentation is a valuable source of information for generating code summaries.We, therefore, have been motivated to leverage such a type of documentation along with deep learning techniques towards generating high-quality summaries for APIs discussed in informal documentation.   This paper proposes an automatic approach using the BART algorithm, a state-of-the-art transformer model, to generate summaries for APIs discussed in StackOverflow.We built an oracle of human-generated summaries to evaluate our approach against it using ROUGE and BLEU metrics which are the most widely used evaluation metrics in text summarization.Furthermore, we evaluated our summaries empirically against a previous work in terms of quality.Our findings demonstrate that using deep learning algorithms can improve summaries' quality and outperform the previous work by an average of %57 for Precision, %66 for Recall, and %61 for F-measure, and it runs 4.4 times faster.</p>
