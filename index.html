                  <p>Composed Image Retrieval (CoIR) has recently gained popularity as a task that considers both text and image queries together, to search for relevant images in a database.Most CoIR approaches require manually annotated datasets, comprising image-text-image triplets, where the text describes a modification from the query image to the target image.However, manual curation of CoIR triplets is expensive and prevents scalability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we instead propose a scalable automatic dataset creation methodology that generates triplets given video-caption pairs, while also expanding the scope of the task to include composed video retrieval (CoVR). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>To this end, we mine paired videos with a similar caption from a large database, and leverage a large language model to generate the corresponding modification text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Applying this methodology to the extensive WebVid2M collection, we automatically construct our WebVid-CoVR dataset, resulting in 1.6 million triplets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.809</span></span>Moreover, we introduce a new benchmark for CoVR with a manually annotated evaluation set, along with baseline results.Our experiments further demonstrate that training a CoVR model on our dataset effectively transfers to CoIR, leading to improved state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot setup on both the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://imagine.enpc.fr/~ventural/covr. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span></p>

                  <p>The emergence of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) emphasizes the need for accurate and efficient prompting approaches.LLMs are often applied in Few-Shot Learning (FSL) contexts, where tasks are executed with minimal training data.FSL has become popular in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) subdomains, including AI for health.Rare diseases, affecting a small fraction of the population, inherently require FSL techniques due to limited data availability, though manual data collection and annotation is costly and time-consuming.In this paper, we propose Models-Vote Prompting (MVP), a flexible prompting approach for improving the performance of LLM queries in FSL settings.MVP works by prompting numerous LLMs to perform the same tasks and then conducting a majority vote on the resulting outputs.This method achieves improved results to any one model in the ensemble on one-shot rare disease identification and classification tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also release a novel rare disease dataset for FSL, available to those who agreed to the MIMIC-IV Data Use Agreement (DUA). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Furthermore, in using MVP, each model is prompted multiple times, substantially increasing the time needed for manual annotation, and to address this, we assess the feasibility of using JSON for automating generative LLM evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Grounded on pre-trained language models (PLMs), dense retrieval has been studied extensively on plain text.In contrast, there has been little research on retrieving data with multiple aspects using dense models.In the scenarios such as product search, the aspect information plays an essential role in relevance matching, e.g., category: Electronics, Computers, and Pet Supplies.A common way of leveraging aspect information for multi-aspect retrieval is to introduce an auxiliary classification objective, i.e., using item contents to predict the annotated value IDs of item aspects.However, by learning the value embeddings from scratch, this approach may not capture the various semantic similarities between the values sufficiently.To address this limitation, we leverage the aspect information as text strings rather than class IDs during pre-training so that their semantic similarities can be naturally captured in the PLMs.To facilitate effective retrieval with the aspect strings, we propose mutual prediction objectives between the text of the item aspect and content.In this way, our model makes more sufficient use of aspect information than conducting undifferentiated masked language modeling (MLM) on the concatenated text of aspects and content.Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets (product and mini-program search) show that our approach can outperform competitive baselines both treating aspect values as classes and conducting the same MLM for aspect and content strings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and related dataset will be available at the URL \footnote{https://github.com/sunxiaojie99/ATTEMPT}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span></p>

                  <p>Precise, seamless, and efficient train localization as well as long-term railway environment monitoring is the essential property towards reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety (RAMS) engineering for railroad systems.Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is right at the core of solving the two problems concurrently.In this end, we propose a high-performance and versatile multi-modal framework in this paper, targeted for the odometry and mapping task for various rail vehicles.Our system is built atop an inertial-centric state estimator that tightly couples light detection and ranging (LiDAR), visual, optionally satellite navigation and map-based localization information with the convenience and extendibility of loosely coupled methods.The inertial sensors IMU and wheel encoder are treated as the primary sensor, which achieves the observations from subsystems to constrain the accelerometer and gyroscope biases.Compared to point-only LiDAR-inertial methods, our approach leverages more geometry information by introducing both track plane and electric power pillars into state estimation.The Visual-inertial subsystem also utilizes the environmental structure information by employing both lines and points.Besides, the method is capable of handling sensor failures by automatic reconfiguration bypassing failure modules.Our proposed method has been extensively tested in the long-during railway environments over four years, including general-speed, high-speed and metro, both passenger and freight traffic are investigated.Further, we aim to share, in an open way, the experience, problems, and successes of our group with the robotics community so that those that work in such environments can avoid these errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this view, we open source some of the datasets to benefit the research community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modern large language models (LLMs) that rely on attention mechanisms are typically trained with fixed context lengths which enforce upper limits on the length of input sequences that they can handle at evaluation time.To use these models on sequences longer than the train-time context length, one might employ techniques from the growing family of context length extrapolation methods -- most of which focus on modifying the system of positional encodings used in the attention mechanism to indicate where tokens or activations are located in the input sequence.We conduct a wide survey of existing methods of context length extrapolation on a base LLaMA or LLaMA 2 model, and introduce some of our own design as well -- in particular, a new truncation strategy for modifying the basis for the position encoding.   We test these methods using three new evaluation tasks (FreeFormQA, AlteredNumericQA, and LongChat-Lines) as well as perplexity, which we find to be less fine-grained as a measure of long context performance of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the three tasks publicly as datasets on HuggingFace. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span>We discover that linear scaling is the best method for extending context length, and show that further gains can be achieved by using longer scales at evaluation time.We also discover promising extrapolation capabilities in the truncated basis.To support further research in this area, we release three new 13B parameter long-context models which we call Giraffe: 4k and 16k context models trained from base LLaMA-13B, and a 32k context model trained from base LLaMA2-13B. We also release the code to replicate our results.</p>

                  <p>This paper strives for motion expressions guided video segmentation, which focuses on segmenting objects in video content based on a sentence describing the motion of the objects.Existing referring video object datasets typically focus on salient objects and use language expressions that contain excessive static attributes that could potentially enable the target object to be identified in a single frame.These datasets downplay the importance of motion in video content for language-guided video object segmentation.To investigate the feasibility of using motion expressions to ground and segment objects in videos, we propose a large-scale dataset called MeViS, which contains numerous motion expressions to indicate target objects in complex environments.We benchmarked 5 existing referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods and conducted a comprehensive comparison on the MeViS dataset.The results show that current RVOS methods cannot effectively address motion expression-guided video segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further analyze the challenges and propose a baseline approach for the proposed MeViS dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span>The goal of our benchmark is to provide a platform that enables the development of effective language-guided video segmentation algorithms that leverage motion expressions as a primary cue for object segmentation in complex video scenes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed MeViS dataset has been released at https://henghuiding.github.io/MeViS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span></p>

                  <p>Motion mode (M-mode) recording is an essential part of echocardiography to measure cardiac dimension and function.However, the current diagnosis cannot build an automatic scheme, as there are three fundamental obstructs: Firstly, there is no open dataset available to build the automation for ensuring constant results and bridging M-mode echocardiography with real-time instance segmentation (RIS); Secondly, the examination is involving the time-consuming manual labelling upon M-mode echocardiograms; Thirdly, as objects in echocardiograms occupy a significant portion of pixels, the limited receptive field in existing backbones (e.g., ResNet) composed from multiple convolution layers are inefficient to cover the period of a valve movement.Existing non-local attentions (NL) compromise being unable real-time with a high computation overhead or losing information from a simplified version of the non-local block.Therefore, we proposed RAMEM, a real-time automatic M-mode echocardiography measurement scheme, contributes three aspects to answer the problems: 1) provide MEIS, a dataset of M-mode echocardiograms for instance segmentation, to enable consistent results and support the development of an automatic scheme; 2) propose panel attention, local-to-global efficient attention by pixel-unshuffling, embedding with updated UPANets V2 in a RIS scheme toward big object detection with global receptive field; 3) develop and implement AMEM, an efficient algorithm of automatic M-mode echocardiography measurement enabling fast and accurate automatic labelling among diagnosis.The experimental results show that RAMEM surpasses existing RIS backbones (with non-local attention) in PASCAL 2012 SBD and human performances in real-time MEIS tested.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code of MEIS and dataset are available at https://github.com/hanktseng131415go/RAME. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>While cities around the world are looking for smart ways to use new advances in data collection, management, and analysis to address their problems, the complex nature of urban issues and the overwhelming amount of available data have posed significant challenges in translating these efforts into actionable insights.In the past few years, urban visual analytics tools have significantly helped tackle these challenges.When analyzing a feature of interest, an urban expert must transform, integrate, and visualize different thematic (e.g., sunlight access, demographic) and physical (e.g., buildings, street networks) data layers, oftentimes across multiple spatial and temporal scales.However, integrating and analyzing these layers require expertise in different fields, increasing development time and effort.This makes the entire visual data exploration and system implementation difficult for programmers and also sets a high entry barrier for urban experts outside of computer science.With this in mind, in this paper, we present the Urban Toolkit (UTK), a flexible and extensible visualization framework that enables the easy authoring of web-based visualizations through a new high-level grammar specifically built with common urban use cases in mind.In order to facilitate the integration and visualization of different urban data, we also propose the concept of knots to merge thematic and physical urban layers.We evaluate our approach through use cases and a series of interviews with experts and practitioners from different domains, including urban accessibility, urban planning, architecture, and climate science.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>UTK is available at urbantk.org. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.863</span></span></p>

Methods: A state-of-the-art text recognition model is trained to establish a baseline.Stenographic domain knowledge is integrated by applying four different encoding methods that transform the target sequence into representations, which approximate selected aspects of the writing system.Results are further improved by integrating a pre-training scheme, based on synthetic data.   Results:The baseline model achieves an average test character error rate (CER) of 29.81% and a word error rate (WER) of 55.14%.Test error rates are reduced significantly by combining stenography-specific target sequence encodings with pre-training and fine-tuning, yielding CERs in the range of 24.5% - 26% and WERs of 44.8% - 48.2%.   Conclusion:The obtained results demonstrate the challenging nature of stenography recognition.Integrating stenography-specific knowledge, in conjunction with pre-training and fine-tuning on synthetic data, yields considerable improvements.Together with our precursor study on the subject, this is the first work to apply modern handwritten text recognition to stenography.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and our code are publicly available via Zenodo. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span></p>

                  <p>Foundation vision-language models are currently transforming computer vision, and are on the rise in medical imaging fueled by their very promising generalization capabilities.However, the initial attempts to transfer this new paradigm to medical imaging have shown less impressive performances than those observed in other domains, due to the significant domain shift and the complex, expert domain knowledge inherent to medical-imaging tasks.Motivated by the need for domain-expert foundation models, we present FLAIR, a pre-trained vision-language model for universal retinal fundus image understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we compiled 37 open-access, mostly categorical fundus imaging datasets from various sources, with up to 97 different target conditions and 284,660 images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.92</span></span>We integrate the expert's domain knowledge in the form of descriptive textual prompts, during both pre-training and zero-shot inference, enhancing the less-informative categorical supervision of the data.Such a textual expert's knowledge, which we compiled from the relevant clinical literature and community standards, describes the fine-grained features of the pathologies as well as the hierarchies and dependencies between them.We report comprehensive evaluations, which illustrate the benefit of integrating expert knowledge and the strong generalization capabilities of FLAIR under difficult scenarios with domain shifts or unseen categories.When adapted with a lightweight linear probe, FLAIR outperforms fully-trained, dataset-focused models, more so in the few-shot regimes.Interestingly, FLAIR outperforms by a large margin more generalist, larger-scale image-language models, which emphasizes the potential of embedding experts' domain knowledge and the limitations of generalist models in medical imaging.</p>

                  <p>We propose \emph{regular expression inference (REI)} as a challenge for code/language modelling, and the wider machine learning community.REI is a supervised machine learning (ML) and program synthesis task, and poses the problem of finding minimal regular expressions from examples: Given two finite sets of strings $P$ and $N$ and a cost function $\text{cost}(\cdot)$, the task is to generate an expression $r$ that accepts all strings in $P$ and rejects all strings in $N$, while no other such expression $r'$ exists with $\text{cost}(r')<\text{cost}(r)$.   REI has advantages as a challenge problem: (i) regular expressions are well-known, widely used, and a natural idealisation of code; (ii) REI's asymptotic worst-case complexity is well understood; (iii) REI has a small number of easy to understand parameters (e.g.~$P$ or $N$ cardinality, string lengths of examples, or the cost function); this lets us easily finetune REI-hardness; (iv) REI is an unsolved problem for deep learning based ML.   Recently, an REI solver was implemented on GPUs, using program synthesis techniques.This enabled, for the first time, fast generation of minimal expressions for complex REI instances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this advance, we generate and publish the first large-scale datasets for REI, and devise and evaluate several initial heuristic and machine learning baselines.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span>We invite the community to participate and explore ML methods that learn to solve REI problems.We believe that progress in REI directly translates to code/language modelling.</p>

                  <p>Despite significant advances in deep learning, models often struggle to generalize well to new, unseen domains, especially when training data is limited.To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for distribution-aware latent augmentation that leverages the relationships across samples to guide the augmentation procedure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach first degrades the samples stochastically in the latent space, mapping them to augmented labels, and then restores the samples from their corrupted versions during training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>This process confuses the classifier in the degradation step and restores the overall class distribution of the original samples, promoting diverse intra-class/cross-domain variability.We extensively evaluate our approach on a diverse set of datasets and tasks, including domain generalization benchmarks and medical imaging datasets with strong domain shift, where we show our approach achieves significant improvements over existing methods for latent space augmentation.We further show that our method can be flexibly adapted to long-tail recognition tasks, demonstrating its versatility in building more generalizable models.Code is available at https://github.com/nerdslab/LatentDR.</p>

                  <p>Multi-label image recognition in the low-label regime is a task of great challenge and practical significance.Previous works have focused on learning the alignment between textual and visual spaces to compensate for limited image labels, yet may suffer from reduced accuracy due to the scarcity of high-quality multi-label annotations.In this research, we leverage the powerful alignment between textual and visual features pretrained with millions of auxiliary image-text pairs.We introduce an efficient and effective framework called Evidence-guided Dual Context Optimization (DualCoOp++), which serves as a unified approach for addressing partial-label and zero-shot multi-label recognition.In DualCoOp++ we separately encode evidential, positive, and negative contexts for target classes as parametric components of the linguistic input (i.e., prompts).The evidential context aims to discover all the related visual content for the target class, and serves as guidance to aggregate positive and negative contexts from the spatial domain of the image, enabling better distinguishment between similar categories.Additionally, we introduce a Winner-Take-All module that promotes inter-class interaction during training, while avoiding the need for extra parameters and costs.As DualCoOp++ imposes minimal additional learnable overhead on the pretrained vision-language framework, it enables rapid adaptation to multi-label recognition tasks with limited annotations and even unseen classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on standard multi-label recognition benchmarks across two challenging low-label settings demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

The aim of this thesis is to describe the development of a tool for Rust programmers to reduce the chances of publishing a new version of the code that violates semantic versioning.   There are already on-going plans to bundle this tool into the language's standard development toolchain.It would make it commonly used and therefore help users to safely get bug fixes, security patches and new functionality, without worrying about their app being broken by a dependency change.</p>
