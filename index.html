                  <p>Data contamination in language model evaluation is increasingly prevalent as the popularity of large language models.It allows models to "cheat" via memorisation instead of displaying true capabilities.Therefore, contamination analysis has became an crucial part of reliable model evaluation to validate results.However, existing contamination analysis is usually conducted internally by LLM developers and often lacks transparency and completeness.This paper present an open source data contamination reports for the Llama series models.We analyse six popular multi-choice QA benchmarks and quantify their overlapping with the training set of Llama.Various levels of contamination ranging from 1\% to 8.7\% are found across benchmarks.Our comparison also reveals that Llama models can gain over 5\% higher accuracy on contaminated subsets versus clean subsets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data and code are available at: https://github.com/liyucheng09/Contamination_Detector. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scene synthesis is a challenging problem with several industrial applications.Recently, substantial efforts have been directed to synthesize the scene using human motions, room layouts, or spatial graphs as the input.However, few studies have addressed this problem from multiple modalities, especially combining text prompts.In this paper, we propose a language-driven scene synthesis task, which is a new task that integrates text prompts, human motion, and existing objects for scene synthesis.Unlike other single-condition synthesis tasks, our problem involves multiple conditions and requires a strategy for processing and encoding them into a unified space.To address the challenge, we present a multi-conditional diffusion model, which differs from the implicit unification approach of other diffusion literature by explicitly predicting the guiding points for the original data distribution.We demonstrate that our approach is theoretically supportive.The intensive experiment results illustrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks and enables natural scene editing applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and dataset can be accessed at https://lang-scene-synth.github.io/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously data-inefficient, which makes training on a real robot difficult.While model-based RL algorithms (world models) improve data-efficiency to some extent, they still require hours or days of interaction to learn skills.Recently, offline RL has been proposed as a framework for training RL policies on pre-existing datasets without any online interaction.However, constraining an algorithm to a fixed dataset induces a state-action distribution shift between training and inference, and limits its applicability to new tasks.In this work, we seek to get the best of both worlds: we consider the problem of pretraining a world model with offline data collected on a real robot, and then finetuning the model on online data collected by planning with the learned model.To mitigate extrapolation errors during online interaction, we propose to regularize the planner at test-time by balancing estimated returns and (epistemic) model uncertainty.We evaluate our method on a variety of visuo-motor control tasks in simulation and on a real robot, and find that our method enables few-shot finetuning to seen and unseen tasks even when offline data is limited.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Videos, code, and data are available at https://yunhaifeng.com/FOWM . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.869</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved promising zero-shot accuracy on visual question answering (VQA) -- a fundamental task affecting various downstream applications and domains.Given the great potential for the broad use of these models, it is important to investigate their limitations in dealing with different image and question properties.In this work, we investigate whether multimodal LLMs can perceive small details as well as large details in images.In particular, we show that their zero-shot accuracy in answering visual questions is very sensitive to the size of the visual subject of the question, declining up to $46\%$ with size.Furthermore, we show that this effect is causal by observing that human visual cropping can significantly mitigate their sensitivity to size.Inspired by the usefulness of human cropping, we then propose three automatic visual cropping methods as inference time mechanisms to improve the zero-shot performance of multimodal LLMs.We study their effectiveness on four popular VQA datasets, and a subset of the VQAv2 dataset tailored towards fine visual details.Our findings suggest that multimodal LLMs should be used with caution in detail-sensitive VQA applications, and that visual cropping is a promising direction to improve their zero-shot performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span></p>

                  <p>Many attempts have been made at estimating discrete emotions (calmness, anxiety, boredom, surprise, anger) and continuous emotional measures commonly used in psychology, namely `valence' (The pleasantness of the emotion being displayed) and `arousal' (The intensity of the emotion being displayed).Existing methods to estimate arousal and valence rely on learning from data sets, where an expert annotator labels every image frame.Access to an expert annotator is not always possible, and the annotation can also be tedious.Hence it is more practical to obtain self-reported arousal and valence values directly from the human in a real-time Human-Robot collaborative setting.Hence this paper provides an emotion data set (HRI-AVC) obtained while conducting a human-robot interaction (HRI) task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The self-reported pair of labels in this data set is associated with a set of image frames. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span>This paper also proposes a spatial and temporal attention-based network to estimate arousal and valence from this set of image frames.The results show that an attention-based network can estimate valence and arousal on the HRI-AVC data set even when Arousal and Valence values are unavailable per frame.</p>

                  <p>Robotic manipulation can greatly benefit from the data efficiency, robustness, and predictability of model-based methods if robots can quickly generate models of novel objects they encounter.This is especially difficult when effects like complex joint friction lack clear first-principles models and are usually ignored by physics simulators.Further, numerically-stiff contact dynamics can make common model-building approaches struggle.We propose a method to simultaneously learn contact and continuous dynamics of a novel, possibly multi-link object by observing its motion through contact-rich trajectories.We formulate a system identification process with a loss that infers unmeasured contact forces, penalizing their violation of physical constraints and laws of motion given current model parameters.Our loss is unlike prediction-based losses used in differentiable simulation.Using a new dataset of real articulated object trajectories and an existing cube toss dataset, our method outperforms differentiable simulation and end-to-end alternatives with more data efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>See our project page for code, datasets, and media: https://sites.google.com/view/continuous-contact-nets/home <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen significant growth over the past few years.Despite this, there has been little work on generating diagrams with T2I models.A diagram is a symbolic/schematic representation that explains information using structurally rich and spatially complex visualizations (e.g., a dense combination of related objects, text labels, directional arrows, connection lines, etc.).Existing state-of-the-art T2I models often fail at diagram generation because they lack fine-grained object layout control when many objects are densely connected via complex relations such as arrows/lines and also often fail to render comprehensible text labels.To address this gap, we present DiagrammerGPT, a novel two-stage text-to-diagram generation framework that leverages the layout guidance capabilities of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to generate more accurate open-domain, open-platform diagrams.In the first stage, we use LLMs to generate and iteratively refine 'diagram plans' (in a planner-auditor feedback loop) which describe all the entities (objects and text labels), their relationships (arrows or lines), and their bounding box layouts.In the second stage, we use a diagram generator, DiagramGLIGEN, and a text label rendering module to generate diagrams following the diagram plans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To benchmark the text-to-diagram generation task, we introduce AI2D-Caption, a densely annotated diagram dataset built on top of the AI2D dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span>We show quantitatively and qualitatively that our DiagrammerGPT framework produces more accurate diagrams, outperforming existing T2I models.We also provide comprehensive analysis including open-domain diagram generation, vector graphic diagram generation in different platforms, human-in-the-loop diagram plan editing, and multimodal planner/auditor LLMs (e.g., GPT-4Vision).We hope our work can inspire further research on diagram generation via T2I models and LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in open-ended scenarios is challenging because existing benchmarks and metrics can not measure them comprehensively.To address this problem, we propose to fine-tune LLMs as scalable judges (JudgeLM) to evaluate LLMs efficiently and effectively in open-ended benchmarks.We first propose a comprehensive, large-scale, high-quality dataset containing task seeds, LLMs-generated answers, and GPT-4-generated judgments for fine-tuning high-performance judges, as well as a new benchmark for evaluating the judges.We train JudgeLMat different scales from 7B, 13B, to 33B parameters, and conduct a systematic analysis of its capabilities and behaviors.We then analyze the key biases in fine-tuning LLM as a judge and consider them as position bias, knowledge bias, and format bias.To address these issues, JudgeLM introduces a bag of techniques including swap augmentation, reference support, and reference drop, which clearly enhance the judge's performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>JudgeLM obtains the state-of-the-art judge performance on both the existing PandaLM benchmark and our proposed new benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>Our JudgeLM is efficient and the JudgeLM-7B only needs 3 minutes to judge 5K samples with 8 A100 GPUs.JudgeLM obtains high agreement with the teacher judge, achieving an agreement exceeding 90% that even surpasses human-to-human agreement.JudgeLM also demonstrates extended capabilities in being judges of the single answer, multimodal models, multiple answers, and multi-turn chat.</p>

                  <p>In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, wherein artificial intelligence and the automation of machines occupy a central role, the deployment of robots is indispensable.However, the manufacturing process using robots, especially in collaboration with humans, is highly intricate.In particular, modeling the friction torque in robotic joints is a longstanding problem due to the lack of a good mathematical description.This motivates the usage of data-driven methods in recent works.However, model-based and data-driven models often exhibit limitations in their ability to generalize beyond the specific dynamics they were trained on, as we demonstrate in this paper.To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach based on residual learning, which aims to adapt an existing friction model to new dynamics using as little data as possible.We validate our approach by training a base neural network on a symmetric friction data set to learn an accurate relation between the velocity and the friction torque.Subsequently, to adapt to more complex asymmetric settings, we train a second network on a small dataset, focusing on predicting the residual of the initial network's output.By combining the output of both networks in a suitable manner, our proposed estimator outperforms the conventional model-based approach and the base neural network significantly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we evaluate our method on trajectories involving external loads and still observe a substantial improvement, approximately 60-70\%, over the conventional approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Our method does not rely on data with external load during training, eliminating the need for external torque sensors.This demonstrates the generalization capability of our approach, even with a small amount of data-only 43 seconds of a robot movement-enabling adaptation to diverse scenarios based on prior knowledge about friction in different settings.</p>

                  <p>Clustering is a fundamental problem in unsupervised machine learning with many applications in data analysis.Popular clustering algorithms such as Lloyd's algorithm and $k$-means++ can take $\Omega(ndk)$ time when clustering $n$ points in a $d$-dimensional space (represented by an $n\times d$ matrix $X$) into $k$ clusters.In applications with moderate to large $k$, the multiplicative $k$ factor can become very expensive.We introduce a simple randomized clustering algorithm that provably runs in expected time $O(\mathrm{nnz}(X)+n\log n)$ for arbitrary $k$. Here $\mathrm{nnz}(X)$ is the total number of non-zero entries in the input dataset $X$, which is upper bounded by $nd$ and can be significantly smaller for sparse datasets.We prove that our algorithm achieves approximation ratio $\smash{\widetilde{O}(k^4)}$ on any input dataset for the $k$-means objective.We also believe that our theoretical analysis is of independent interest, as we show that the approximation ratio of a $k$-means algorithm is approximately preserved under a class of projections and that $k$-means++ seeding can be implemented in expected $O(n \logn)$ time in one dimension.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we show experimentally that our clustering algorithm gives a new tradeoff between running time and cluster quality compared to previous state-of-the-art methods for these tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span></p>

                  <p>Along with recent diffusion models, randomized smoothing has become one of a few tangible approaches that offers adversarial robustness to models at scale, e.g., those of large pre-trained models.Specifically, one can perform randomized smoothing on any classifier via a simple "denoise-and-classify" pipeline, so-called denoised smoothing, given that an accurate denoiser is available - such as diffusion model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and certified robustness of denoised smoothing: for example, we question on which representation of diffusion model would maximize the certified robustness of denoised smoothing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>We consider a new objective that aims collective robustness of smoothed classifiers across multiple noise levels at a shared diffusion model, which also suggests a new way to compensate the cost of accuracy in randomized smoothing for its certified robustness.This objective motivates us to fine-tune diffusion model (a) to perform consistent denoising whenever the original image is recoverable, but (b) to generate rather diverse outputs otherwise.Our experiments show that this fine-tuning scheme of diffusion models combined with the multi-scale smoothing enables a strong certified robustness possible at highest noise level while maintaining the accuracy closer to non-smoothed classifiers.</p>

In fact, we can also compute, within the same runtime, the value of a non-strict saddlepoint, assuming one exists.Our algorithm is based on a simple recursive approach, a feasibility test inspired by searching in sorted matrices, and a relaxed notion of saddlepoint.</p>

Our main contributions are optimal algorithms and lower bounds for clustering and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in this model.For $k$-centers, $k$-median, and $k$-means, we give constant factor approximation algorithms with only $\tilde{O}(k)$ strong oracle point queries, and prove that $\Omega(k)$ queries are required for any bounded approximation.For edge queries, our upper and lower bounds are both $\tilde{\Theta}(k^2)$. Surprisingly, for the MST problem we give a $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ approximation algorithm using no strong oracle queries at all, and a matching $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$ lower bound.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We empirically evaluate our algorithms, and show that their quality is comparable to that of the baseline algorithms that are given all true distances, but while querying the strong oracle on only a small fraction ($<1\%$) of points. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been demonstrated effective in solving complex control tasks, sample efficiency remains a key challenge due to the large amounts of data required for remarkable performance.Existing research explores the application of representation learning for data-efficient RL, e.g., learning predictive representations by predicting long-term future states.However, many existing methods do not fully exploit the structural information inherent in sequential state signals, which can potentially improve the quality of long-term decision-making but is difficult to discern in the time domain.To tackle this problem, we propose State Sequences Prediction via Fourier Transform (SPF), a novel method that exploits the frequency domain of state sequences to extract the underlying patterns in time series data for learning expressive representations efficiently.Specifically, we theoretically analyze the existence of structural information in state sequences, which is closely related to policy performance and signal regularity, and then propose to predict the Fourier transform of infinite-step future state sequences to extract such information.One of the appealing features of SPF is that it is simple to implement while not requiring storage of infinite-step future states as prediction targets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both sample efficiency and performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span></p>

                  <p>A recent paper by Farina & Pipis (2023) established the existence of uncoupled no-linear-swap regret dynamics with polynomial-time iterations in extensive-form games.The equilibrium points reached by these dynamics, known as linear correlated equilibria, are currently the tightest known relaxation of correlated equilibrium that can be learned in polynomial time in any finite extensive-form game.However, their properties remain vastly unexplored, and their computation is onerous.In this paper, we provide several contributions shedding light on the fundamental nature of linear-swap regret.First, we show a connection between linear deviations and a generalization of communication deviations in which the player can make queries to a "mediator" who replies with action recommendations, and, critically, the player is not constrained to match the timing of the game as would be the case for communication deviations.We coin this latter set the untimed communication (UTC) deviations.We show that the UTC deviations coincide precisely with the linear deviations, and therefore that any player minimizing UTC regret also minimizes linear-swap regret.We then leverage this connection to develop state-of-the-art no-regret algorithms for computing linear correlated equilibria, both in theory and in practice.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In theory, our algorithms achieve polynomially better per-iteration runtimes; in practice, our algorithms represent the state of the art by several orders of magnitude. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>While deep learning models have achieved remarkable success across a range of medical image analysis tasks, deployment of these models in real clinical contexts requires that they be robust to variability in the acquired images.While many methods apply predefined transformations to augment the training data to enhance test-time robustness, these transformations may not ensure the model's robustness to the diverse variability seen in patient images.In this paper, we introduce a novel three-stage approach based on transformers coupled with conditional diffusion models, with the goal of improving model robustness to the kinds of imaging variability commonly encountered in practice without the need for pre-determined data augmentation strategies.To this end, multiple image encoders first learn hierarchical feature representations to build discriminative latent spaces.Next, a reverse diffusion process, guided by the latent code, acts on an informative prior and proposes prediction candidates in a generative manner.Finally, several prediction candidates are aggregated in a bi-level aggregation protocol to produce the final output.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments on medical imaging benchmark datasets, we show that our method improves upon state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and confidence calibration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Additionally, we introduce a strategy to quantify the prediction uncertainty at the instance level, increasing their trustworthiness to clinicians using them in clinical practice.</p>

                  <p>The introduction of DETR represents a new paradigm for object detection.However, its decoder conducts classification and box localization using shared queries and cross-attention layers, leading to suboptimal results.We observe that different regions of interest in the visual feature map are suitable for performing query classification and box localization tasks, even for the same object.Salient regions provide vital information for classification, while the boundaries around them are more favorable for box regression.Unfortunately, such spatial misalignment between these two tasks greatly hinders DETR's training.Therefore, in this work, we focus on decoupling localization and classification tasks in DETR.To achieve this, we introduce a new design scheme called spatially decoupled DETR (SD-DETR), which includes a task-aware query generation module and a disentangled feature learning process.We elaborately design the task-aware query initialization process and divide the cross-attention block in the decoder to allow the task-aware queries to match different visual regions.Meanwhile, we also observe that the prediction misalignment problem for high classification confidence and precise localization exists, so we propose an alignment loss to further guide the spatially decoupled DETR training.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant improvement in MSCOCO datasets compared to previous work.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For instance, we improve the performance of Conditional DETR by 4.5 AP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>By spatially disentangling the two tasks, our method overcomes the misalignment problem and greatly improves the performance of DETR for object detection.</p>

                  <p>A deep autoencoder (DAE)-based structure for endto-end communication over the two-user Z-interference channel (ZIC) with finite-alphabet inputs is designed in this paper.The proposed structure jointly optimizes the two encoder/decoder pairs and generates interference-aware constellations that dynamically adapt their shape based on interference intensity to minimize the bit error rate (BER).An in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) power allocation layer is introduced in the DAE to guarantee an average power constraint and enable the architecture to generate constellations with nonuniform shapes.This brings further gain compared to standard uniform constellations such as quadrature amplitude modulation.The proposed structure is then extended to work with imperfect channel state information (CSI).The CSI imperfection due to both the estimation and quantization errors are examined.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The performance of the DAEZIC is compared with two baseline methods, i.e., standard and rotated constellations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>The proposed structure significantly enhances the performance of the ZIC both for the perfect and imperfect CSI.Simulation results show that the improvement is achieved in all interference regimes (weak, moderate, and strong) and consistently increases with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).For example, more than an order of magnitude BER reduction is obtained with respect to the most competitive conventional method at weak interference when SNR>15dB and two bits per symbol are transmitted.The improvements reach about two orders of magnitude when quantization error exists, indicating that the DAE-ZIC is more robust to the interference compared to the conventional methods.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to enable collaborative model training with decentralized data.However, the training process of Large Language Models (LLMs) generally incurs the update of significant parameters, which limits the applicability of FL techniques to tackle the LLMs in real scenarios.Prompt tuning can significantly reduce the number of parameters to update, but it either incurs performance degradation or low training efficiency.The straightforward utilization of prompt tuning in the FL often raises non-trivial communication costs and dramatically degrades performance.In addition, the decentralized data is generally non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID), which brings client drift problems and thus poor performance.This paper proposes a Parameter-efficient prompt Tuning approach with Adaptive Optimization, i.e., FedPepTAO, to enable efficient and effective FL of LLMs.First, an efficient partial prompt tuning approach is proposed to improve performance and efficiency simultaneously.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, a novel adaptive optimization method is developed to address the client drift problems on both the device and server sides to enhance performance further. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Extensive experiments based on 10 datasets demonstrate the superb performance (up to 60.8\% in terms of accuracy) and efficiency (up to 97.59\% in terms of training time) of FedPepTAO compared with 9 baseline approaches.Our code is available at https://github.com/llm-eff/FedPepTAO.</p>

                  <p>Image scaling is an integral part of machine learning and computer vision systems.Unfortunately, this preprocessing step is vulnerable to so-called image-scaling attacks where an attacker makes unnoticeable changes to an image so that it becomes a new image after scaling.This opens up new ways for attackers to control the prediction or to improve poisoning and backdoor attacks.While effective techniques exist to prevent scaling attacks, their detection has not been rigorously studied yet.Consequently, it is currently not possible to reliably spot these attacks in practice.   This paper presents the first in-depth systematization and analysis of detection methods for image-scaling attacks.We identify two general detection paradigms and derive novel methods from them that are simple in design yet significantly outperform previous work.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the efficacy of these methods in a comprehensive evaluation with all major learning platforms and scaling algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>First, we show that image-scaling attacks modifying the entire scaled image can be reliably detected even under an adaptive adversary.Second, we find that our methods provide strong detection performance even if only minor parts of the image are manipulated.As a result, we can introduce a novel protection layer against image-scaling attacks.</p>

                  <p>Logical reasoning, i.e., deductively inferring the truth value of a conclusion from a set of premises, is an important task for artificial intelligence with wide potential impacts on science, mathematics, and society.While many prompting-based strategies have been proposed to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to do such reasoning more effectively, they still appear unsatisfactory, often failing in subtle and unpredictable ways.In this work, we investigate the validity of instead reformulating such tasks as modular neurosymbolic programming, which we call LINC:Logical Inference via Neurosymbolic Computation.In LINC, the LLM acts as a semantic parser, translating premises and conclusions from natural language to expressions in first-order logic.These expressions are then offloaded to an external theorem prover, which symbolically performs deductive inference.Leveraging this approach, we observe significant performance gains on FOLIO and a balanced subset of ProofWriter for three different models in nearly all experimental conditions we evaluate.On ProofWriter, augmenting the comparatively small open-source StarCoder+ (15.5B parameters) with LINC even outperforms GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting by an absolute 38% and 10%, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When used with GPT-4, LINC scores 26% higher than CoT on ProofWriter while performing comparatively on FOLIO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis reveals that although both methods on average succeed roughly equally often on this dataset, they exhibit distinct and complementary failure modes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>We thus provide promising evidence for how logical reasoning over natural language can be tackled through jointly leveraging LLMs alongside symbolic provers.All corresponding code is publicly available at https://github.com/benlipkin/linc</p>

We sketch how the methodology can lead to a Skill-Mix based eco-system of open evaluations for AI capabilities of future models.</p>

To evaluate and demonstrate the utility of HANSEN, we perform Authorship Attribution (AA) & Author Verification (AV) on human-spoken datasets and conducted Human vs. AI spoken text detection using state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.While SOTA methods, such as, character ngram or Transformer-based model, exhibit similar AA & AV performance in human-spoken datasets compared to written ones, there is much room for improvement in AI-generated spoken text detection.The HANSEN benchmark is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/HANSEN-REPO/HANSEN.</p>

This paper proposes an automatic approach using the BART algorithm, a state-of-the-art transformer model, to generate summaries for APIs discussed in StackOverflow.We built an oracle of human-generated summaries to evaluate our approach against it using ROUGE and BLEU metrics which are the most widely used evaluation metrics in text summarization.Furthermore, we evaluated our summaries empirically against a previous work in terms of quality.Our findings demonstrate that using deep learning algorithms can improve summaries' quality and outperform the previous work by an average of %57 for Precision, %66 for Recall, and %61 for F-measure, and it runs 4.4 times faster.</p>
