                  <p>Cereal grain plays a crucial role in the human diet as a major source of essential nutrients.Grain Appearance Inspection (GAI) serves as an essential process to determine grain quality and facilitate grain circulation and processing.However, GAI is routinely performed manually by inspectors with cumbersome procedures, which poses a significant bottleneck in smart agriculture.   In this paper, we endeavor to develop an automated GAI system:AI4GrainInsp.By analyzing the distinctive characteristics of grain kernels, we formulate GAI as a ubiquitous problem: Anomaly Detection (AD), in which healthy and edible kernels are considered normal samples while damaged grains or unknown objects are regarded as anomalies.We further propose an AD model, called AD-GAI, which is trained using only normal samples yet can identify anomalies during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we customize a prototype device for data acquisition and create a large-scale dataset including 220K high-quality images of wheat and maize kernels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.842</span></span>Through extensive experiments, AD-GAI achieves considerable performance in comparison with advanced AD methods, and AI4GrainInsp has highly consistent performance compared to human experts and excels at inspection efficiency over 20x speedup.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, code and models will be released at https://github.com/hellodfan/AI4GrainInsp. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.873</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the growth of machine learning techniques, privacy of data of users has become a major concern.Most of the machine learning algorithms rely heavily on large amount of data which may be collected from various sources.Collecting these data yet maintaining privacy policies has become one of the most challenging tasks for the researchers.To combat this issue, researchers have introduced federated learning, where a prediction model is learnt by ensuring the privacy of data of clients data.However, the prevalent federated learning algorithms possess an accuracy and efficiency trade-off, especially for non-IID data.In this research, we propose a centralized, neural network-based federated learning system.The centralized algorithm incorporates micro-level parallel processing inspired by the traditional mini-batch algorithm where the client devices and the server handle the forward and backward propagation respectively.We also devise a semi-centralized version of our proposed algorithm.This algorithm takes advantage of edge computing for minimizing the load from the central server, where clients handle both the forward and backward propagation while sacrificing the overall train time to some extent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our proposed systems on five well-known benchmark datasets and achieve satisfactory performance in a reasonable time across various data distribution settings as compared to some existing benchmark algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) have mostly focused on application-driven tasks such as complex reasoning and code generation, and this has led to a scarcity in purely linguistic evaluation of LLMs.Against this background, we introduce Multilingual Evaluation of Linguistic Acceptability -- MELA, the first multilingual benchmark on linguistic acceptability with 48K samples covering 10 languages from a diverse set of language families.We establish baselines of commonly used LLMs along with supervised models, and conduct cross-lingual transfer and multi-task learning experiments with XLM-R. In pursuit of multilingual interpretability, we analyze the weights of fine-tuned XLM-R to explore the possibility of identifying transfer difficulty between languages.Our results show that ChatGPT benefits much from in-context examples but still lags behind fine-tuned XLM-R, while the performance of GPT-4 is on par with fine-tuned XLM-R even in zero-shot setting.Cross-lingual and multi-task learning experiments show that unlike semantic tasks, in-language training data is crucial in acceptability judgements.Results in layerwise probing indicate that the upper layers of XLM-R become a task-specific but language-agnostic region for multilingual acceptability judgment.We also introduce the concept of conflicting weight, which could be a potential indicator for the difficulty of cross-lingual transfer between languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data will be available at https://github.com/sjtu-compling/MELA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Context: An assurance case is a structured hierarchy of claims aiming at demonstrating that a given mission-critical system supports specific requirements (e.g., safety, security, privacy).The presence of assurance weakeners (i.e., assurance deficits, logical fallacies) in assurance cases reflects insufficient evidence, knowledge, or gaps in reasoning.These weakeners can undermine confidence in assurance arguments, potentially hindering the verification of mission-critical system capabilities.   Objectives:As a stepping stone for future research on assurance weakeners, we aim to initiate the first comprehensive systematic mapping study on this subject.Methods: We followed the well-established PRISMA 2020 and SEGRESS guidelines to conduct our systematic mapping study.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We searched for primary studies in five digital libraries and focused on the 2012-2023 publication year range. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>Our selection criteria focused on studies addressing assurance weakeners at the modeling level, resulting in the inclusion of 39 primary studies in our systematic review.   Results: Our systematic mapping study reports a taxonomy (map) that provides a uniform categorization of assurance weakeners and approaches proposed to manage them at the modeling level.   Conclusion: Our study findings suggest that the SACM (Structured Assurance Case Metamodel) -- a standard specified by the OMG (Object Management Group) -- may be the best specification to capture structured arguments and reason about their potential assurance weakeners.</p>

                  <p>Are Large language models (LLMs) temporally grounded?Since LLMs cannot perceive and interact with the environment, it is impossible to answer this question directly.Instead, we provide LLMs with textual narratives and probe them with respect to their common-sense knowledge of the structure and duration of events, their ability to order events along a timeline, and self-consistency within their temporal model (e.g., temporal relations such as after and before are mutually exclusive for any pair of events).We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs (such as LLaMA 2 and GPT-4) on three tasks reflecting these abilities.Generally, we find that LLMs lag significantly behind both human performance as well as small-scale, specialised LMs.In-context learning, instruction tuning, and chain-of-thought prompting reduce this gap only to a limited degree.Crucially, LLMs struggle the most with self-consistency, displaying incoherent behaviour in at least 27.23% of their predictions.Contrary to expectations, we also find that scaling the model size does not guarantee positive gains in performance.To explain these results, we study the sources from which LLMs may gather temporal information: we find that sentence ordering in unlabelled texts, available during pre-training, is only weakly correlated with event ordering.Moreover, public instruction tuning mixtures contain few temporal tasks.Hence, we conclude that current LLMs lack a consistent temporal model of textual narratives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, datasets, and LLM outputs are available at https://github.com/yfqiu-nlp/temporal-llms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D content creation via text-driven stylization has played a fundamental challenge to multimedia and graphics community.Recent advances of cross-modal foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have made this problem feasible.Those approaches commonly leverage CLIP to align the holistic semantics of stylized mesh with the given text prompt.Nevertheless, it is not trivial to enable more controllable stylization of fine-grained details in 3D meshes solely based on such semantic-level cross-modal supervision.In this work, we propose a new 3DStyle-Diffusion model that triggers fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes with additional controllable appearance and geometric guidance from 2D Diffusion models.Technically, 3DStyle-Diffusion first parameterizes the texture of 3D mesh into reflectance properties and scene lighting using implicit MLP networks.Meanwhile, an accurate depth map of each sampled view is achieved conditioned on 3D mesh.Then, 3DStyle-Diffusion leverages a pre-trained controllable 2D Diffusion model to guide the learning of rendered images, encouraging the synthesized image of each view semantically aligned with text prompt and geometrically consistent with depth map.This way elegantly integrates both image rendering via implicit MLP networks and diffusion process of image synthesis in an end-to-end fashion, enabling a high-quality fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also build a new dataset derived from Objaverse and the evaluation protocol for this task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we validate the capability of our 3DStyle-Diffusion.Source code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/yanghb22-fdu/3DStyle-Diffusion-Official}.</p>

                  <p>Recent works have showcased the ability of large-scale language models (LLMs) to embody diverse personas in their responses, exemplified by prompts like 'You are Yoda.Explain the Theory of Relativity.'While this ability allows personalization of LLMs and enables human behavior simulation, its effect on LLMs' capabilities remain unclear.To fill this gap, we present the first extensive study of the unintended side-effects of persona assignment on the ability of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, to perform basic reasoning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study covers 24 reasoning datasets and 16 diverse personas spanning 5 socio-demographic groups: race, gender, religion, disability, and political affiliation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span>Our experiments unveil that ChatGPT carries deep rooted bias against various socio-demographics underneath a veneer of fairness.While it overtly rejects stereotypes when explicitly asked ('Are Black people less skilled at mathematics?'), it manifests stereotypical and often erroneous presumptions when prompted to answer questions while taking on a persona.These can be observed as abstentions in the model responses, e.g., 'As a Black person, I am unable to answer this question as it requires math knowledge', and generally result in a substantial drop in performance on reasoning tasks.We find that this inherent deep bias is ubiquitous - 80% of our personas demonstrated bias; it is significant - certain datasets had relative drops in performance of 70%+; and can be especially harmful for certain groups - certain personas had stat.sign.drops on more than 80% of the datasets.Further analysis shows that these persona-induced errors can be hard-to-discern and hard-to-avoid.Our findings serve as a cautionary tale that the practice of assigning personas to LLMs - a trend on the rise - can surface their deep-rooted biases and have unforeseeable and detrimental side-effects.</p>

                  <p>Recently, pretrained language models have shown state-of-the-art performance on the vulnerability detection task.These models are pretrained on a large corpus of source code, then fine-tuned on a smaller supervised vulnerability dataset.Due to the different training objectives and the performance of the models, it is interesting to consider whether the models have learned the semantics of code relevant to vulnerability detection, namely bug semantics, and if so, how the alignment to bug semantics relates to model performance.In this paper, we analyze the models using three distinct methods: interpretability tools, attention analysis, and interaction matrix analysis.We compare the models' influential feature sets with the bug semantic features which define the causes of bugs, including buggy paths and Potentially Vulnerable Statements (PVS).We find that (1) better-performing models also aligned better with PVS, (2) the models failed to align strongly to PVS, and (3) the models failed to align at all to buggy paths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on our analysis, we developed two annotation methods which highlight the bug semantics inside the model's inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>We evaluated our approach on four distinct transformer models and four vulnerability datasets and found that our annotations improved the models' performance in the majority of settings - 11 out of 16, with up to 9.57 points improvement in F1 score compared to conventional fine-tuning.We further found that with our annotations, the models aligned up to 232% better to potentially vulnerable statements.Our findings indicate that it is helpful to provide the model with information of the bug semantics, that the model can attend to it, and motivate future work in learning more complex path-based bug semantics.Our code and data are available at https://figshare.com/s/4a16a528d6874aad51a0.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, there has been a surge in the prevalence of high- and multi-dimensional temporal data across various scientific disciplines.These datasets are characterized by their vast size and challenging potential for analysis.Such data typically exhibit serial and cross-dependency and possess high dimensionality, thereby introducing additional complexities to conventional time series analysis methods.To address these challenges, a recent and complementary approach has emerged, known as network-based analysis methods for multivariate time series.In univariate settings, Quantile Graphs have been employed to capture temporal transition properties and reduce data dimensionality by mapping observations to a smaller set of sample quantiles.   To confront the increasingly prominent issue of high dimensionality, we propose an extension of Quantile Graphs into a multivariate variant, which we term "Multilayer Quantile Graphs".In this innovative mapping, each time series is transformed into a Quantile Graph, and inter-layer connections are established to link contemporaneous quantiles of pairwise series.This enables the analysis of dynamic transitions across multiple dimensions.In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this new mapping using a synthetic multivariate time series dataset.We delve into the resulting network's topological structures, extract network features, and employ these features for original dataset analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we compare our results with a recent method from the literature. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>The resulting multilayer network offers a significant reduction in the dimensionality of the original data while capturing serial and cross-dimensional transitions.This approach facilitates the characterization and analysis of large multivariate time series datasets through network analysis techniques.</p>

                  <p>Human facial data hold tremendous potential to address a variety of classification problems, including face recognition, age estimation, gender identification, emotion analysis, and race classification.However, recent privacy regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and others, have restricted the ways in which human images may be collected and used for research.As a result, several previously published data sets containing human faces have been removed from the internet due to inadequate data collection methods that failed to meet privacy regulations.Data sets consisting of synthetic data have been proposed as an alternative, but they fall short of accurately representing the real data distribution.On the other hand, most available data sets are labeled for just a single task, which limits their applicability.To address these issues, we present the Multi-Task Faces (MTF) image data set, a meticulously curated collection of face images designed for various classification tasks, including face recognition, as well as race, gender, and age classification.The MTF data set has been ethically gathered by leveraging publicly available images of celebrities and strictly adhering to copyright regulations.In this paper, we present this data set and provide detailed descriptions of the followed data collection and processing procedures.Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of five deep learning (DL) models on the MTF data set across the aforementioned classification tasks.Additionally, we compare the performance of DL models over the processed MTF data and over raw data crawled from the internet.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The reported results constitute a baseline for further research employing these data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>The MTF data set can be accessed through the following link (please cite the present paper if you use the data set): https://github.com/RamiHaf/MTF_data_set</p>

                  <p>Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising paradigm for image classification by comparing the similarity between images and class embeddings.A critical challenge lies in crafting precise textual representations for class names.While previous studies have leveraged recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) to enhance these descriptors, their outputs often suffer from ambiguity and inaccuracy.We identify two primary causes: 1) The prevalent reliance on textual interactions with LLMs, leading to a mismatch between the generated text and the visual content in VLMs' latent space - a phenomenon we term the "explain without seeing" dilemma. 2)The oversight of the inter-class relationships, resulting in descriptors that fail to differentiate similar classes effectively.To address these issues, we propose a novel image classification framework combining VLMs with LLMs, named Iterative Optimization with Visual Feedback.In particular, our method develops an LLM-based agent, employing an evolutionary optimization strategy to refine class descriptors.Crucially, we incorporate visual feedback from VLM classification metrics, thereby guiding the optimization process with concrete visual data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method leads to improving accuracy on a wide range of image classification benchmarks, with 3.47\% average gains over state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>We also highlight the resulting descriptions serve as explainable and robust features that can consistently improve the performance across various backbone models.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection (AD) is essential in identifying rare and often critical events in complex systems, finding applications in fields such as network intrusion detection, financial fraud detection, and fault detection in infrastructure and industrial systems.While AD is typically treated as an unsupervised learning task due to the high cost of label annotation, it is more practical to assume access to a small set of labeled anomaly samples from domain experts, as is the case for semi-supervised anomaly detection.Semi-supervised and supervised approaches can leverage such labeled data, resulting in improved performance.In this paper, rather than proposing a new semi-supervised or supervised approach for AD, we introduce a novel algorithm for generating additional pseudo-anomalies on the basis of the limited labeled anomalies and a large volume of unlabeled data.This serves as an augmentation to facilitate the detection of new anomalies.Our proposed algorithm, named Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Mixup (NNG-Mix), efficiently integrates information from both labeled and unlabeled data to generate pseudo-anomalies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare the performance of this novel algorithm with commonly applied augmentation techniques, such as Mixup and Cutout. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>We evaluate NNG-Mix by training various existing semi-supervised and supervised anomaly detection algorithms on the original training data along with the generated pseudo-anomalies.Through extensive experiments on 57 benchmark datasets in ADBench, reflecting different data types, we demonstrate that NNG-Mix outperforms other data augmentation methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It yields significant performance improvements compared to the baselines trained exclusively on the original training data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Notably, NNG-Mix yields up to 16.4%, 8.8%, and 8.0% improvements on Classical, CV, and NLP datasets in ADBench.Our source code will be available at https://github.com/donghao51/NNG-Mix.</p>

                  <p>Sequential logic synthesis can provide better Power-Performance-Area (PPA) than combinational logic synthesis since it explores a larger solution space.As the gate cost in advanced technologies keeps rising, sequential logic synthesis provides a powerful alternative that is gaining momentum in the EDA community.In this work, we present a new scalable algorithm for don't-care-based sequential logic synthesis.Our new approach is based on sequential k-step induction and can apply both redundancy removal and resubstitution transformations under Sequential Observability Don't Cares (SODCs).Using SODC-based optimizations with induction is a challenging problem due to dependencies and alignment of don't cares among the base case and the inductive case.We propose a new approach utilizing the full power of SODCs without limiting the solution space.Our algorithm is implemented as part of an industrial tool and achieves 6.9% average area improvement after technology mapping when compared to state-of-the-art sequential synthesis methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, all the new sequential optimizations can be verified using state-of-the-art sequential verification tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the sixth-generation (6G) networks, massive low-power devices are expected to sense environment and deliver tremendous data.To enhance the radio resource efficiency, the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique exploits the sensing and communication functionalities of signals, while the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) techniques utilizes the same signals as the carriers for both information and power delivery.The further combination of ISAC and SWIPT leads to the advanced technology namely integrated sensing, communication, and power transfer (ISCPT).In this paper, a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISCPT system is considered, where a base station equipped with multiple antennas transmits messages to multiple information receivers (IRs), transfers power to multiple energy receivers (ERs), and senses a target simultaneously.The sensing target can be regarded as a point or an extended surface.When the locations of IRs and ERs are separated, the MIMO beamforming designs are optimized to improve the sensing performance while meeting the communication and power transfer requirements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The resultant non-convex optimization problems are solved based on a series of techniques including Schur complement transformation and rank reduction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Moreover, when the IRs and ERs are co-located, the power splitting factors are jointly optimized together with the beamformers to balance the performance of communication and power transfer.To better understand the performance of ISCPT, the target positioning problem is further investigated.Simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed designs, which also reveal a performance tradeoff among sensing, communication, and power transfer.</p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, either improving existing recommendation models or serving as the backbone.However, there exists a large semantic gap between LLMs and recommender systems, since items to be recommended are often indexed by discrete identifiers (item ID) out of the LLM's vocabulary.In essence, LLMs capture language semantics while recommender systems imply collaborative semantics, making it difficult to sufficiently leverage the model capacity of LLMs for recommendation.To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a new LLM-based recommendation model called LC-Rec, which can better integrate language and collaborative semantics for recommender systems.Our approach can directly generate items from the entire item set for recommendation, without relying on candidate items.Specifically, we make two major contributions in our approach.For item indexing, we design a learning-based vector quantization method with uniform semantic mapping, which can assign meaningful and non-conflicting IDs (called item indices) for items.For alignment tuning, we propose a series of specially designed tuning tasks to enhance the integration of collaborative semantics in LLMs.Our fine-tuning tasks enforce LLMs to deeply integrate language and collaborative semantics (characterized by the learned item indices), so as to achieve an effective adaptation to recommender systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing that our approach can outperform a number of competitive baselines including traditional recommenders and existing LLM-based recommenders. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/LC-Rec/.</p>

                  <p>Recent research has shown that transformer networks can be used as differentiable search indexes by representing each document as a sequences of document ID tokens.These generative retrieval models cast the retrieval problem to a document ID generation problem for each given query.Despite their elegant design, existing generative retrieval models only perform well on artificially-constructed and small-scale collections.This has led to serious skepticism in the research community on their real-world impact.This paper represents an important milestone in generative retrieval research by showing, for the first time, that generative retrieval models can be trained to perform effectively on large-scale standard retrieval benchmarks.For doing so, we propose RIPOR-an optimization framework for generative retrieval that can be adopted by any encoder-decoder architecture.RIPOR is designed based on two often-overlooked fundamental design considerations in generative retrieval.First, given the sequential decoding nature of document ID generation, assigning accurate relevance scores to documents based on the whole document ID sequence is not sufficient.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, RIPOR introduces a novel prefix-oriented ranking optimization algorithm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Second, initial document IDs should be constructed based on relevance associations between queries and documents, instead of the syntactic and semantic information in the documents.RIPOR addresses this issue using a relevance-based document ID construction approach that quantizes relevance-based representations learned for documents.Evaluation on MSMARCO and TREC Deep Learning Track reveals that RIPOR surpasses state-of-the-art generative retrieval models by a large margin (e.g., 30.5% MRR improvements on MS MARCO Dev Set), and perform better on par with popular dense retrieval models.</p>

                  <p>We revisit the problem of efficiently learning the underlying parameters of Ising models from data.Current algorithmic approaches achieve essentially optimal sample complexity when given i.i.d. samples from the stationary measure and the underlying model satisfies "width" bounds on the total $\ell_1$ interaction involving each node.We show that a simple existing approach based on node-wise logistic regression provably succeeds at recovering the underlying model in several new settings where these assumptions are violated:   (1) Given dynamically generated data from a wide variety of local Markov chains, like block or round-robin dynamics, logistic regression recovers the parameters with optimal sample complexity up to $\log\log n$ factors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This generalizes the specialized algorithm of Bresler, Gamarnik, and <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Shah [IEEE Trans.Inf.Theory'18] for structure recovery in bounded degree graphs from Glauber dynamics.   (2) For the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin glasses, given $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ independent samples, logistic regression recovers the parameters in most of the known high-temperature regime via a simple reduction to weaker structural properties of the measure.This improves on recent work of Anari, Jain, Koehler, Pham, and Vuong[ArXiv'23] which gives distribution learning at higher temperature.   (3) As a simple byproduct of our techniques, logistic regression achieves an exponential improvement in learning from samples in the M-regime of data considered by Dutt, Lokhov, Vuffray, and Misra[ICML'21] as well as novel guarantees for learning from the adversarial Glauber dynamics of Chin, Moitra, Mossel, and Sandon [ArXiv'23].

                  <p>Text-to-3D generation, which aims to synthesize vivid 3D objects from text prompts, has attracted much attention from the computer vision community.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While several existing works have achieved impressive results for this task, they mainly rely on a time-consuming optimization paradigm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Specifically, these methods optimize a neural field from scratch for each text prompt, taking approximately one hour or more to generate one object.This heavy and repetitive training cost impedes their practical deployment.In this paper, we propose a novel framework for fast text-to-3D generation, dubbed Instant3D.Once trained, Instant3D is able to create a 3D object for an unseen text prompt in less than one second with a single run of a feedforward network.We achieve this remarkable speed by devising a new network that directly constructs a 3D triplane from a text prompt.The core innovation of our Instant3D lies in our exploration of strategies to effectively inject text conditions into the network.Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective activation function, the scaled-sigmoid, to replace the original sigmoid function, which speeds up the training convergence by more than ten times.Finally, to address the Janus (multi-head) problem in 3D generation, we propose an adaptive Perp-Neg algorithm that can dynamically adjust its concept negation scales according to the severity of the Janus problem during training, effectively reducing the multi-head effect.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on a wide variety of benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, while achieving significantly better efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>The project page is at https://ming1993li.github.io/Instant3DProj.</p>

                  <p>Session types provide a typing discipline for message-passing systems.However, their theory often assumes an ideal world: one in which everything is reliable and without failures.Yet this is in stark contrast with distributed systems in the real world.To address this limitation, we introduce a new asynchronous multiparty session types (MPST) theory with crash-stop failures, where processes may crash arbitrarily and cease to interact after crashing.We augment asynchronous MPST and processes with crash handling branches, and integrate crash-stop failure semantics into types and processes.Our approach requires no user-level syntax extensions for global types, and features a formalisation of global semantics, which captures complex behaviours induced by crashed/crash handling processes.Our new theory covers the entire spectrum, ranging from the ideal world of total reliability to entirely unreliable scenarios where any process may crash, using optional reliability assumptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Under these assumptions, we demonstrate the sound and complete correspondence between global and local type semantics, which guarantee deadlock-freedom, protocol conformance, and liveness of well-typed processes by construction, even in the presence of crashes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automatic hate speech detection using deep neural models is hampered by the scarcity of labeled datasets, leading to poor generalization.To mitigate this problem, generative AI has been utilized to generate large amounts of synthetic hate speech sequences from available labeled examples, leveraging the generated data in finetuning large pre-trained language models (LLMs).In this chapter, we provide a review of relevant methods, experimental setups and evaluation of this approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to general LLMs, such as BERT, RoBERTa and ALBERT, we apply and evaluate the impact of train set augmentation with generated data using LLMs that have been already adapted for hate detection, including RoBERTa-Toxicity, HateBERT, HateXplain, ToxDect, and ToxiGen. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>An empirical study corroborates our previous findings, showing that this approach improves hate speech generalization, boosting recall performance across data distributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we explore and compare the performance of the finetuned LLMs with zero-shot hate detection using a GPT-3.5 model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>Our results demonstrate that while better generalization is achieved using the GPT-3.5 model, it achieves mediocre recall and low precision on most datasets.It is an open question whether the sensitivity of models such as GPT-3.5, and onward, can be improved using similar techniques of text generation.</p>

To address this problem, we introduce ENDURE, a new paradigm for tuning LSM trees in the presence of workload uncertainty.Specifically, we focus on the impact of the choice of compaction policy, size ratio, and memory allocation on the overall performance.ENDURE considers a robust formulation of the throughput maximization problem and recommends a tuning that offers near-optimal throughput when the executed workload is not the same, instead in a neighborhood of the expected workload.Additionally, we explore the robustness of flexible LSM designs by proposing a new unified design called K-LSM that encompasses existing designs.We deploy our robust tuning system, ENDURE, on a state-of-the-art key-value store, RocksDB, and demonstrate throughput improvements of up to 5x in the presence of uncertainty.Our results indicate that the tunings obtained by ENDURE are more robust than tunings obtained under our expanded LSM design space.This indicates that robustness may not be inherent to a design, instead, it is an outcome of a tuning process that explicitly accounts for uncertainty.</p>
