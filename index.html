                  <p>Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has shown impressive results on diverse downstream tasks by offline training on large-scale datasets.Regarding the growing nature of real-world data, such an offline training paradigm on ever-expanding data is unsustainable, because models lack the continual learning ability to accumulate knowledge constantly.However, most continual learning studies are limited to uni-modal classification and existing multi-modal datasets cannot simulate continual non-stationary data stream scenarios.To support the study of Vision-Language Continual Pretraining (VLCP), we first contribute a comprehensive and unified benchmark dataset P9D which contains over one million product image-text pairs from 9 industries.The data from each industry as an independent task supports continual learning and conforms to the real-world long-tail nature to simulate pretraining on web data.We comprehensively study the characteristics and challenges of VLCP, and propose a new algorithm: Compatible momentum contrast with Topology Preservation, dubbed CTP.The compatible momentum model absorbs the knowledge of the current and previous-task models to flexibly update the modal feature.Moreover, Topology Preservation transfers the knowledge of embedding across tasks while preserving the flexibility of feature adjustment.The experimental results demonstrate our method not only achieves superior performance compared with other baselines but also does not bring an expensive training burden.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/KevinLight831/CTP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.857</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D scene reconstruction is a long-standing vision task.Existing approaches can be categorized into geometry-based and learning-based methods.The former leverages multi-view geometry but can face catastrophic failures due to the reliance on accurate pixel correspondence across views.The latter was proffered to mitigate these issues by learning 2D or 3D representation directly.However, without a large-scale video or 3D training data, it can hardly generalize to diverse real-world scenarios due to the presence of tens of millions or even billions of optimization parameters in the deep network.Recently, robust monocular depth estimation models trained with large-scale datasets have been proven to possess weak 3D geometry prior, but they are insufficient for reconstruction due to the unknown camera parameters, the affine-invariant property, and inter-frame inconsistency.Here, we propose a novel test-time optimization approach that can transfer the robustness of affine-invariant depth models such as LeReS to challenging diverse scenes while ensuring inter-frame consistency, with only dozens of parameters to optimize per video frame.Specifically, our approach involves freezing the pre-trained affine-invariant depth model's depth predictions, rectifying them by optimizing the unknown scale-shift values with a geometric consistency alignment module, and employing the resulting scale-consistent depth maps to robustly obtain camera poses and achieve dense scene reconstruction, even in low-texture regions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset reconstruction on five zero-shot testing datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span></p>

We seek to lower that barrier to entry by introducing a new CAN dataset to facilitate the development and evaluation of automotive IDSs.Our dataset, dubbed can-train-and-test, provides CAN data from four different vehicles produced by two different manufacturers.The attack captures for each vehicle model are equivalent, enabling researchers to assess the ability of a given IDS to generalize to different vehicle models and even different vehicle manufacturers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset contains replayable .log files as well as labeled and unlabeled .csv files, thereby meeting a variety of development and evaluation needs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span>Furthermore, can-train-and-test offers nine unique attacks, ranging from denial of service (DoS) to gear spoofing to standstill...</p>

                  <p>The abundant biodiversity of coral reefs in Indonesian waters is a valuable asset that needs to be preserved.Rapid climate change and uncontrolled human activities have led to the degradation of coral reef ecosystems, including coral bleaching, which is a critical indicator of coral health conditions.Therefore, this research aims to develop an accurate classification model to distinguish between healthy corals and corals experiencing bleaching.This study utilizes a specialized dataset consisting of 923 images collected from Flickr using the Flickr API.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset comprises two distinct classes: healthy corals (438 images) and bleached corals (485 images). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span>These images have been resized to a maximum of 300 pixels in width or height, whichever is larger, to maintain consistent sizes across the dataset.   The method employed in this research involves the use of machine learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN), to recognize and differentiate visual patterns associated with healthy and bleached corals.In this context, the dataset can be used to train and test various classification models to achieve optimal results.By leveraging the ResNet model, it was found that a from-scratch ResNet model can outperform pretrained models in terms of precision and accuracy.The success in developing accurate classification models will greatly benefit researchers and marine biologists in gaining a better understanding of coral reef health.These models can also be employed to monitor changes in the coral reef environment, thereby making a significant contribution to conservation and ecosystem restoration efforts that have far-reaching impacts on life.</p>

                  <p>Event camera-based pattern recognition is a newly arising research topic in recent years.Current researchers usually transform the event streams into images, graphs, or voxels, and adopt deep neural networks for event-based classification.Although good performance can be achieved on simple event recognition datasets, however, their results may be still limited due to the following two issues.Firstly, they adopt spatial sparse event streams for recognition only, which may fail to capture the color and detailed texture information well.Secondly, they adopt either Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) for energy-efficient recognition with suboptimal results, or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for energy-intensive, high-performance recognition.However, seldom of them consider achieving a balance between these two aspects.In this paper, we formally propose to recognize patterns by fusing RGB frames and event streams simultaneously and propose a new RGB frame-event recognition framework to address the aforementioned issues.The proposed method contains four main modules, i.e., memory support Transformer network for RGB frame encoding, spiking neural network for raw event stream encoding, multi-modal bottleneck fusion module for RGB-Event feature aggregation, and prediction head.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Due to the scarce of RGB-Event based classification dataset, we also propose a large-scale PokerEvent dataset which contains 114 classes, and 27102 frame-event pairs recorded using a DVS346 event camera. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.901</span></span>Extensive experiments on two RGB-Event based classification datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.We hope this work will boost the development of pattern recognition by fusing RGB frames and event streams.Both our dataset and source code of this work will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/SSTFormer.</p>

                  <p>Wide-scale use of visual surveillance in public spaces puts individual privacy at stake while increasing resource consumption (energy, bandwidth, and computation).Neuromorphic vision sensors (event-cameras) have been recently considered a valid solution to the privacy issue because they do not capture detailed RGB visual information of the subjects in the scene.However, recent deep learning architectures have been able to reconstruct images from event cameras with high fidelity, reintroducing a potential threat to privacy for event-based vision applications.In this paper, we aim to anonymize event-streams to protect the identity of human subjects against such image reconstruction attacks.To achieve this, we propose an end-to-end network architecture jointly optimized for the twofold objective of preserving privacy and performing a downstream task such as person ReId.Our network learns to scramble events, enforcing the degradation of images recovered from the privacy attacker.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we also bring to the community the first ever event-based person ReId dataset gathered to evaluate the performance of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our approach with extensive experiments and report results on the synthetic event data simulated from the publicly available SoftBio dataset and our proposed Event-ReId dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.839</span></span></p>

                  <p>Segmentation is a fundamental problem in surgical scene analysis using artificial intelligence.However, the inherent data scarcity in this domain makes it challenging to adapt traditional segmentation techniques for this task.To tackle this issue, current research employs pretrained models and finetunes them on the given data.Even so, these require training deep networks with millions of parameters every time new data becomes available.A recently published foundation model, Segment-Anything (SAM), generalizes well to a large variety of natural images, hence tackling this challenge to a reasonable extent.However, SAM does not generalize well to the medical domain as is without utilizing a large amount of compute resources for fine-tuning and using task-specific prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, these prompts are in the form of bounding-boxes or foreground/background points that need to be annotated explicitly for every image, making this solution increasingly tedious with higher data size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>In this work, we propose AdaptiveSAM - an adaptive modification of SAM that can adjust to new datasets quickly and efficiently, while enabling text-prompted segmentation.For finetuning AdaptiveSAM, we propose an approach called bias-tuning that requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than SAM (less than 2\%).At the same time, AdaptiveSAM requires negligible expert intervention since it uses free-form text as prompt and can segment the object of interest with just the label name as prompt.Our experiments show that AdaptiveSAM outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on various medical imaging datasets including surgery, ultrasound and X-ray.Code is available at https://github.com/JayParanjape/biastuning</p>

In this paper, we apply six SZZ algorithms to 76,046 pairs of bug-fixing patches and bug-introducing commits from the Linux kernel.Our findings reveal that SZZ algorithms experience a more significant decline in recall on our dataset (13.8%) as compared to prior findings reported by Rosa et al., and the disparities between the individual SZZ algorithms diminish.Moreover, we find that 17.47% of bug-fixing commits are ghost commits.Finally, we propose Tracing-Commit SZZ (TC-SZZ), that traces all commits in the change history of lines modified or deleted in bug-fixing commits.Applying TC-SZZ to all failure cases, excluding ghost commits, we found that TC-SZZ could identify 17.7% of them.Our further analysis found that 34.6% of bug-inducing commits were in the function history, 27.5% in the file history (but not in the function history), and...</p>

                  <p>Multi-label image recognition in the low-label regime is a task of great challenge and practical significance.Previous works have focused on learning the alignment between textual and visual spaces to compensate for limited image labels, yet may suffer from reduced accuracy due to the scarcity of high-quality multi-label annotations.In this research, we leverage the powerful alignment between textual and visual features pretrained with millions of auxiliary image-text pairs.We introduce an efficient and effective framework called Evidence-guided Dual Context Optimization (DualCoOp++), which serves as a unified approach for addressing partial-label and zero-shot multi-label recognition.In DualCoOp++ we separately encode evidential, positive, and negative contexts for target classes as parametric components of the linguistic input (i.e., prompts).The evidential context aims to discover all the related visual content for the target class, and serves as guidance to aggregate positive and negative contexts from the spatial domain of the image, enabling better distinguishment between similar categories.Additionally, we introduce a Winner-Take-All module that promotes inter-class interaction during training, while avoiding the need for extra parameters and costs.As DualCoOp++ imposes minimal additional learnable overhead on the pretrained vision-language framework, it enables rapid adaptation to multi-label recognition tasks with limited annotations and even unseen classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on standard multi-label recognition benchmarks across two challenging low-label settings demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a well-known method for exposing bugs/vulnerabilities in software systems.Popular fuzzers, such as AFL, use a biased random search over the domain of program inputs, where 100s or 1000s of inputs (test cases) are executed per second in order to expose bugs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If a bug is discovered, it can either be fixed manually by the developer or fixed automatically using an Automated Program Repair (APR) tool. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Like fuzzing, many existing APR tools are search-based, but over the domain of patches rather than inputs.   In this paper, we propose search-based program repair as patch-level fuzzing.The basic idea is to adapt a fuzzer (AFL) to fuzz over the patch space rather than the input space.Thus we use a patch-space fuzzer to explore a patch space, while using a traditional input level fuzzer to rule out patch candidates and help in patch selection.To improve the throughput, we propose a compilation-free patch validation methodology, where we execute the original (unpatched) program natively, then selectively interpret only the specific patched statements and expressions.Since this avoids (re)compilation, we show that compilation-free patch validation can achieve a similar throughput as input-level fuzzing (100s or 1000s of execs/sec).We show that patch-level fuzzing and input-level fuzzing can be combined, for a co-exploration of both spaces in order to find better quality patches.Such a collaboration between input-level fuzzing and patch-level fuzzing is then employed to search over candidate fix locations, as well as patch candidates in each fix location.</p>

                  <p>Despite the increasing interest in quantum computing, the aspect of development to achieve cost-effective and reliable quantum software applications has been slow.One barrier is the software engineering of quantum programs, which can be approached from two directions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the one hand, many software engineering practices, debugging in particular, are bound to classical computing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>On the other hand, quantum programming is closely associated with the phenomena of quantum physics, and consequently, the way we express programs resembles the early days of programming.Moreover, much of the software engineering research today focuses on agile development, where computing cycles are cheap and new software can be rapidly deployed and tested, whereas in the quantum context, executions may consume lots of energy, and test runs may require lots of work to interpret.In this paper, we aim at bridging this gap by starting with the quantum computing workflow and by mapping existing software engineering research to this workflow.Based on the mapping, we then identify directions for software engineering research for quantum computing.</p>

                  <p>ModSecurity is widely recognized as the standard open-source Web Application Firewall (WAF), maintained by the OWASP Foundation.It detects malicious requests by matching them against the Core Rule Set, identifying well-known attack patterns.Each rule in the CRS is manually assigned a weight, based on the severity of the corresponding attack, and a request is detected as malicious if the sum of the weights of the firing rules exceeds a given threshold.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we show that this simple strategy is largely ineffective for detecting SQL injection (SQLi) attacks, as it tends to block many legitimate requests, while also being vulnerable to adversarial SQLi attacks, i.e., attacks intentionally manipulated to evade detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome these issues, we design a robust machine learning model, named AdvModSec, which uses the CRS rules as input features, and it is trained to detect adversarial SQLi attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments show that AdvModSec, being trained on the traffic directed towards the protected web services, achieves a better trade-off between detection and false positive rates, improving the detection rate of the vanilla version of ModSecurity with CRS by 21%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Moreover, our approach is able to improve its adversarial robustness against adversarial SQLi attacks by 42%, thereby taking a step forward towards building more robust and trustworthy WAFs.</p>
