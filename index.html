                  <p>Modern large language models (LLMs) that rely on attention mechanisms are typically trained with fixed context lengths which enforce upper limits on the length of input sequences that they can handle at evaluation time.To use these models on sequences longer than the train-time context length, one might employ techniques from the growing family of context length extrapolation methods -- most of which focus on modifying the system of positional encodings used in the attention mechanism to indicate where tokens or activations are located in the input sequence.We conduct a wide survey of existing methods of context length extrapolation on a base LLaMA or LLaMA 2 model, and introduce some of our own design as well -- in particular, a new truncation strategy for modifying the basis for the position encoding.   We test these methods using three new evaluation tasks (FreeFormQA, AlteredNumericQA, and LongChat-Lines) as well as perplexity, which we find to be less fine-grained as a measure of long context performance of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the three tasks publicly as datasets on HuggingFace. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>We discover that linear scaling is the best method for extending context length, and show that further gains can be achieved by using longer scales at evaluation time.We also discover promising extrapolation capabilities in the truncated basis.To support further research in this area, we release three new 13B parameter long-context models which we call Giraffe: 4k and 16k context models trained from base LLaMA-13B, and a 32k context model trained from base LLaMA2-13B. We also release the code to replicate our results.</p>

                  <p>Motion mode (M-mode) recording is an essential part of echocardiography to measure cardiac dimension and function.However, the current diagnosis cannot build an automatic scheme, as there are three fundamental obstructs: Firstly, there is no open dataset available to build the automation for ensuring constant results and bridging M-mode echocardiography with real-time instance segmentation (RIS); Secondly, the examination is involving the time-consuming manual labelling upon M-mode echocardiograms; Thirdly, as objects in echocardiograms occupy a significant portion of pixels, the limited receptive field in existing backbones (e.g., ResNet) composed from multiple convolution layers are inefficient to cover the period of a valve movement.Existing non-local attentions (NL) compromise being unable real-time with a high computation overhead or losing information from a simplified version of the non-local block.Therefore, we proposed RAMEM, a real-time automatic M-mode echocardiography measurement scheme, contributes three aspects to answer the problems: 1) provide MEIS, a dataset of M-mode echocardiograms for instance segmentation, to enable consistent results and support the development of an automatic scheme; 2) propose panel attention, local-to-global efficient attention by pixel-unshuffling, embedding with updated UPANets V2 in a RIS scheme toward big object detection with global receptive field; 3) develop and implement AMEM, an efficient algorithm of automatic M-mode echocardiography measurement enabling fast and accurate automatic labelling among diagnosis.The experimental results show that RAMEM surpasses existing RIS backbones (with non-local attention) in PASCAL 2012 SBD and human performances in real-time MEIS tested.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code of MEIS and dataset are available at https://github.com/hanktseng131415go/RAME. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span></p>

                  <p>While cities around the world are looking for smart ways to use new advances in data collection, management, and analysis to address their problems, the complex nature of urban issues and the overwhelming amount of available data have posed significant challenges in translating these efforts into actionable insights.In the past few years, urban visual analytics tools have significantly helped tackle these challenges.When analyzing a feature of interest, an urban expert must transform, integrate, and visualize different thematic (e.g., sunlight access, demographic) and physical (e.g., buildings, street networks) data layers, oftentimes across multiple spatial and temporal scales.However, integrating and analyzing these layers require expertise in different fields, increasing development time and effort.This makes the entire visual data exploration and system implementation difficult for programmers and also sets a high entry barrier for urban experts outside of computer science.With this in mind, in this paper, we present the Urban Toolkit (UTK), a flexible and extensible visualization framework that enables the easy authoring of web-based visualizations through a new high-level grammar specifically built with common urban use cases in mind.In order to facilitate the integration and visualization of different urban data, we also propose the concept of knots to merge thematic and physical urban layers.We evaluate our approach through use cases and a series of interviews with experts and practitioners from different domains, including urban accessibility, urban planning, architecture, and climate science.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>UTK is available at urbantk.org. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span></p>

                  <p>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) based physiological measurement is an emerging yet crucial vision task, whose challenge lies in exploring accurate rPPG prediction from facial videos accompanied by noises of illumination variations, facial occlusions, head movements, \etc, in a non-contact manner.Existing mainstream CNN-based models make efforts to detect physiological signals by capturing subtle color changes in facial regions of interest (ROI) caused by heartbeats.However, such models are constrained by the limited local spatial or temporal receptive fields in the neural units.Unlike them, a native Transformer-based framework called Dual-path TokenLearner (Dual-TL) is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the concept of learnable tokens to integrate both spatial and temporal informative contexts from the global perspective of the video.Specifically, the proposed Dual-TL uses a Spatial TokenLearner (S-TL) to explore associations in different facial ROIs, which promises the rPPG prediction far away from noisy ROI disturbances.Complementarily, a Temporal TokenLearner (T-TL) is designed to infer the quasi-periodic pattern of heartbeats, which eliminates temporal disturbances such as head movements.The two TokenLearners, S-TL and T-TL, are executed in a dual-path mode.This enables the model to reduce noise disturbances for final rPPG signal prediction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on four physiological measurement benchmark datasets are conducted. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>The Dual-TL achieves state-of-the-art performances in both intra- and cross-dataset testings, demonstrating its immense potential as a basic backbone for rPPG measurement.The source code is available at \href{https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/Dual-TL}{https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/Dual-TL}</p>

                  <p>Purpose: In this paper, we establish a baseline for handwritten stenography recognition, using the novel LION dataset, and investigate the impact of including selected aspects of stenographic theory into the recognition process.We make the LION dataset publicly available with the aim of encouraging future research in handwritten stenography recognition.   Methods: A state-of-the-art text recognition model is trained to establish a baseline.Stenographic domain knowledge is integrated by applying four different encoding methods that transform the target sequence into representations, which approximate selected aspects of the writing system.Results are further improved by integrating a pre-training scheme, based on synthetic data.   Results:The baseline model achieves an average test character error rate (CER) of 29.81% and a word error rate (WER) of 55.14%.Test error rates are reduced significantly by combining stenography-specific target sequence encodings with pre-training and fine-tuning, yielding CERs in the range of 24.5% - 26% and WERs of 44.8% - 48.2%.   Conclusion:The obtained results demonstrate the challenging nature of stenography recognition.Integrating stenography-specific knowledge, in conjunction with pre-training and fine-tuning on synthetic data, yields considerable improvements.Together with our precursor study on the subject, this is the first work to apply modern handwritten text recognition to stenography.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and our code are publicly available via Zenodo. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span></p>

                  <p>Neuromorphic vision sensors, or event cameras, differ from conventional cameras in that they do not capture images at a specified rate.Instead, they asynchronously log local brightness changes at each pixel.As a result, event cameras only record changes in a given scene, and do so with very high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power requirements.Recent research has demonstrated how these characteristics make event cameras extremely practical sensors in driver monitoring systems (DMS), enabling the tracking of high-speed eye motion and blinks.This research provides a proof of concept to expand event-based DMS techniques to include seatbelt state detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using an event simulator, a dataset of 108,691 synthetic neuromorphic frames of car occupants was generated from a near-infrared (NIR) dataset, and split into training, validation, and test sets for a seatbelt state detection algorithm based on a recurrent convolutional neural network (CNN). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span>In addition, a smaller set of real event data was collected and reserved for testing.In a binary classification task, the fastened/unfastened frames were identified with an F1 score of 0.989 and 0.944 on the simulated and real test sets respectively.When the problem extended to also classify the action of fastening/unfastening the seatbelt, respective F1 scores of 0.964 and 0.846 were achieved.</p>

                  <p>Foundation vision-language models are currently transforming computer vision, and are on the rise in medical imaging fueled by their very promising generalization capabilities.However, the initial attempts to transfer this new paradigm to medical imaging have shown less impressive performances than those observed in other domains, due to the significant domain shift and the complex, expert domain knowledge inherent to medical-imaging tasks.Motivated by the need for domain-expert foundation models, we present FLAIR, a pre-trained vision-language model for universal retinal fundus image understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we compiled 37 open-access, mostly categorical fundus imaging datasets from various sources, with up to 97 different target conditions and 284,660 images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.917</span></span>We integrate the expert's domain knowledge in the form of descriptive textual prompts, during both pre-training and zero-shot inference, enhancing the less-informative categorical supervision of the data.Such a textual expert's knowledge, which we compiled from the relevant clinical literature and community standards, describes the fine-grained features of the pathologies as well as the hierarchies and dependencies between them.We report comprehensive evaluations, which illustrate the benefit of integrating expert knowledge and the strong generalization capabilities of FLAIR under difficult scenarios with domain shifts or unseen categories.When adapted with a lightweight linear probe, FLAIR outperforms fully-trained, dataset-focused models, more so in the few-shot regimes.Interestingly, FLAIR outperforms by a large margin more generalist, larger-scale image-language models, which emphasizes the potential of embedding experts' domain knowledge and the limitations of generalist models in medical imaging.</p>

                  <p>We propose \emph{regular expression inference (REI)} as a challenge for code/language modelling, and the wider machine learning community.REI is a supervised machine learning (ML) and program synthesis task, and poses the problem of finding minimal regular expressions from examples: Given two finite sets of strings $P$ and $N$ and a cost function $\text{cost}(\cdot)$, the task is to generate an expression $r$ that accepts all strings in $P$ and rejects all strings in $N$, while no other such expression $r'$ exists with $\text{cost}(r')<\text{cost}(r)$.   REI has advantages as a challenge problem: (i) regular expressions are well-known, widely used, and a natural idealisation of code; (ii) REI's asymptotic worst-case complexity is well understood; (iii) REI has a small number of easy to understand parameters (e.g.~$P$ or $N$ cardinality, string lengths of examples, or the cost function); this lets us easily finetune REI-hardness; (iv) REI is an unsolved problem for deep learning based ML.   Recently, an REI solver was implemented on GPUs, using program synthesis techniques.This enabled, for the first time, fast generation of minimal expressions for complex REI instances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this advance, we generate and publish the first large-scale datasets for REI, and devise and evaluate several initial heuristic and machine learning baselines.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.831</span></span>We invite the community to participate and explore ML methods that learn to solve REI problems.We believe that progress in REI directly translates to code/language modelling.</p>

                  <p>Multi-label image recognition in the low-label regime is a task of great challenge and practical significance.Previous works have focused on learning the alignment between textual and visual spaces to compensate for limited image labels, yet may suffer from reduced accuracy due to the scarcity of high-quality multi-label annotations.In this research, we leverage the powerful alignment between textual and visual features pretrained with millions of auxiliary image-text pairs.We introduce an efficient and effective framework called Evidence-guided Dual Context Optimization (DualCoOp++), which serves as a unified approach for addressing partial-label and zero-shot multi-label recognition.In DualCoOp++ we separately encode evidential, positive, and negative contexts for target classes as parametric components of the linguistic input (i.e., prompts).The evidential context aims to discover all the related visual content for the target class, and serves as guidance to aggregate positive and negative contexts from the spatial domain of the image, enabling better distinguishment between similar categories.Additionally, we introduce a Winner-Take-All module that promotes inter-class interaction during training, while avoiding the need for extra parameters and costs.As DualCoOp++ imposes minimal additional learnable overhead on the pretrained vision-language framework, it enables rapid adaptation to multi-label recognition tasks with limited annotations and even unseen classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on standard multi-label recognition benchmarks across two challenging low-label settings demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a well-known method for exposing bugs/vulnerabilities in software systems.Popular fuzzers, such as AFL, use a biased random search over the domain of program inputs, where 100s or 1000s of inputs (test cases) are executed per second in order to expose bugs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If a bug is discovered, it can either be fixed manually by the developer or fixed automatically using an Automated Program Repair (APR) tool. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>Like fuzzing, many existing APR tools are search-based, but over the domain of patches rather than inputs.   In this paper, we propose search-based program repair as patch-level fuzzing.The basic idea is to adapt a fuzzer (AFL) to fuzz over the patch space rather than the input space.Thus we use a patch-space fuzzer to explore a patch space, while using a traditional input level fuzzer to rule out patch candidates and help in patch selection.To improve the throughput, we propose a compilation-free patch validation methodology, where we execute the original (unpatched) program natively, then selectively interpret only the specific patched statements and expressions.Since this avoids (re)compilation, we show that compilation-free patch validation can achieve a similar throughput as input-level fuzzing (100s or 1000s of execs/sec).We show that patch-level fuzzing and input-level fuzzing can be combined, for a co-exploration of both spaces in order to find better quality patches.Such a collaboration between input-level fuzzing and patch-level fuzzing is then employed to search over candidate fix locations, as well as patch candidates in each fix location.</p>
