                  <p>Existing work has found that the prompt engineering heavily influences the performance of large language models (LLMs).Chain-of-thought (CoT), as a popular prompt engineering technique, prompted LLMs using in-context examples with reasoning steps.In current studies, the few-shot examples of CoT are generally handcrafted by humans.However, how the text style of in-context examples influence the outputs of LLMs still remains under-explored.This paper presents a novel and effective approach, named \textbf{AlignCoT}, to improve the reasoning capability of LLMs by aligning the in-context examples with the native style of LLMs.``Native'' refers to the inherent characteristic style of LLMs which can be probed by original zero-shot scenarios.AlignCoT is orthogonal to other prompt engineering methods, making it easy to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve the LLMs' performance.We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks.The empirical results demonstrate that our AlignCoTsignificantly improves performance over the carefully handcrafted in-context examples.For instance, with GPT-3.5-turbo, we observed a +2.5\% improvement on GSM8K. Furthermore, our AlignCoT consistently improve the performance when combined with other state-of-the-art prompt engineering methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and dataset will be available at \href{https://github.com/yangzhch6/AlignCoT}{https://github.com/yangzhch6/AlignCoT}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit superior performance in various machine learning tasks, e.g., image classification, speech recognition, biometric recognition, object detection, etc.However, it is essential to analyze their sensitivity to parameter perturbations before deploying them in real-world applications.In this work, we assess the sensitivity of DNNs against perturbations to their weight and bias parameters.The sensitivity analysis involves three DNN architectures (VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet), three types of parameter perturbations (Gaussian noise, weight zeroing, and weight scaling), and two settings (entire network and layer-wise).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform experiments in the context of iris presentation attack detection and evaluate on two publicly available datasets: LivDet-Iris-2017 and LivDet-Iris-2020. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Based on the sensitivity analysis, we propose improved models simply by perturbing parameters of the network without undergoing training.We further combine these perturbed models at the score-level and at the parameter-level to improve the performance over the original model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The ensemble at the parameter-level shows an average improvement of 43.58% on the LivDet-Iris-2017 dataset and 9.25% on the LivDet-Iris-2020 dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>The source code is available at \href{https://github.com/redwankarimsony/WeightPerturbation-MSU}{https://github.com/redwankarimsony/WeightPerturbation-MSU}.</p>

In this paper, we endeavor to develop an automated GAI system:AI4GrainInsp.By analyzing the distinctive characteristics of grain kernels, we formulate GAI as a ubiquitous problem: Anomaly Detection (AD), in which healthy and edible kernels are considered normal samples while damaged grains or unknown objects are regarded as anomalies.We further propose an AD model, called AD-GAI, which is trained using only normal samples yet can identify anomalies during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we customize a prototype device for data acquisition and create a large-scale dataset including 220K high-quality images of wheat and maize kernels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.842</span></span>Through extensive experiments, AD-GAI achieves considerable performance in comparison with advanced AD methods, and AI4GrainInsp has highly consistent performance compared to human experts and excels at inspection efficiency over 20x speedup.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, code and models will be released at https://github.com/hellodfan/AI4GrainInsp. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.873</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) have mostly focused on application-driven tasks such as complex reasoning and code generation, and this has led to a scarcity in purely linguistic evaluation of LLMs.Against this background, we introduce Multilingual Evaluation of Linguistic Acceptability -- MELA, the first multilingual benchmark on linguistic acceptability with 48K samples covering 10 languages from a diverse set of language families.We establish baselines of commonly used LLMs along with supervised models, and conduct cross-lingual transfer and multi-task learning experiments with XLM-R. In pursuit of multilingual interpretability, we analyze the weights of fine-tuned XLM-R to explore the possibility of identifying transfer difficulty between languages.Our results show that ChatGPT benefits much from in-context examples but still lags behind fine-tuned XLM-R, while the performance of GPT-4 is on par with fine-tuned XLM-R even in zero-shot setting.Cross-lingual and multi-task learning experiments show that unlike semantic tasks, in-language training data is crucial in acceptability judgements.Results in layerwise probing indicate that the upper layers of XLM-R become a task-specific but language-agnostic region for multilingual acceptability judgment.We also introduce the concept of conflicting weight, which could be a potential indicator for the difficulty of cross-lingual transfer between languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data will be available at https://github.com/sjtu-compling/MELA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Context: An assurance case is a structured hierarchy of claims aiming at demonstrating that a given mission-critical system supports specific requirements (e.g., safety, security, privacy).The presence of assurance weakeners (i.e., assurance deficits, logical fallacies) in assurance cases reflects insufficient evidence, knowledge, or gaps in reasoning.These weakeners can undermine confidence in assurance arguments, potentially hindering the verification of mission-critical system capabilities.   Objectives:As a stepping stone for future research on assurance weakeners, we aim to initiate the first comprehensive systematic mapping study on this subject.Methods: We followed the well-established PRISMA 2020 and SEGRESS guidelines to conduct our systematic mapping study.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We searched for primary studies in five digital libraries and focused on the 2012-2023 publication year range. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>Our selection criteria focused on studies addressing assurance weakeners at the modeling level, resulting in the inclusion of 39 primary studies in our systematic review.   Results: Our systematic mapping study reports a taxonomy (map) that provides a uniform categorization of assurance weakeners and approaches proposed to manage them at the modeling level.   Conclusion: Our study findings suggest that the SACM (Structured Assurance Case Metamodel) -- a standard specified by the OMG (Object Management Group) -- may be the best specification to capture structured arguments and reason about their potential assurance weakeners.</p>

                  <p>Are Large language models (LLMs) temporally grounded?Since LLMs cannot perceive and interact with the environment, it is impossible to answer this question directly.Instead, we provide LLMs with textual narratives and probe them with respect to their common-sense knowledge of the structure and duration of events, their ability to order events along a timeline, and self-consistency within their temporal model (e.g., temporal relations such as after and before are mutually exclusive for any pair of events).We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs (such as LLaMA 2 and GPT-4) on three tasks reflecting these abilities.Generally, we find that LLMs lag significantly behind both human performance as well as small-scale, specialised LMs.In-context learning, instruction tuning, and chain-of-thought prompting reduce this gap only to a limited degree.Crucially, LLMs struggle the most with self-consistency, displaying incoherent behaviour in at least 27.23% of their predictions.Contrary to expectations, we also find that scaling the model size does not guarantee positive gains in performance.To explain these results, we study the sources from which LLMs may gather temporal information: we find that sentence ordering in unlabelled texts, available during pre-training, is only weakly correlated with event ordering.Moreover, public instruction tuning mixtures contain few temporal tasks.Hence, we conclude that current LLMs lack a consistent temporal model of textual narratives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, datasets, and LLM outputs are available at https://github.com/yfqiu-nlp/temporal-llms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been a rapid advancement in research on Large Language Models (LLMs), resulting in significant progress in several Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.Consequently, there has been a surge in LLM evaluation research to comprehend the models' capabilities and limitations.However, much of this research has been confined to the English language, leaving LLM building and evaluation for non-English languages relatively unexplored.There has been an introduction of several new LLMs, necessitating their evaluation on non-English languages.This study aims to expand our MEGA benchmarking suite by including six new datasets to form the MEGAVERSE benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The benchmark comprises 22 datasets covering 81 languages, including low-resource African languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT4, PaLM2, and Llama2 on the MEGAVERSE datasets.Additionally, we include two multimodal datasets in the benchmark and assess the performance of the LLaVa-v1.5 model.Our experiments suggest that GPT4 and PaLM2 outperform the Llama models on various tasks, notably on low-resource languages, with GPT4 outperforming PaLM2 on more datasets than vice versa.However, issues such as data contamination must be addressed to obtain an accurate assessment of LLM performance on non-English languages.</p>

                  <p>Recently, pretrained language models have shown state-of-the-art performance on the vulnerability detection task.These models are pretrained on a large corpus of source code, then fine-tuned on a smaller supervised vulnerability dataset.Due to the different training objectives and the performance of the models, it is interesting to consider whether the models have learned the semantics of code relevant to vulnerability detection, namely bug semantics, and if so, how the alignment to bug semantics relates to model performance.In this paper, we analyze the models using three distinct methods: interpretability tools, attention analysis, and interaction matrix analysis.We compare the models' influential feature sets with the bug semantic features which define the causes of bugs, including buggy paths and Potentially Vulnerable Statements (PVS).We find that (1) better-performing models also aligned better with PVS, (2) the models failed to align strongly to PVS, and (3) the models failed to align at all to buggy paths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on our analysis, we developed two annotation methods which highlight the bug semantics inside the model's inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>We evaluated our approach on four distinct transformer models and four vulnerability datasets and found that our annotations improved the models' performance in the majority of settings - 11 out of 16, with up to 9.57 points improvement in F1 score compared to conventional fine-tuning.We further found that with our annotations, the models aligned up to 232% better to potentially vulnerable statements.Our findings indicate that it is helpful to provide the model with information of the bug semantics, that the model can attend to it, and motivate future work in learning more complex path-based bug semantics.Our code and data are available at https://figshare.com/s/4a16a528d6874aad51a0.</p>

                  <p>The optimization of traffic signal control (TSC) is critical for an efficient transportation system.In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have emerged as a popular approach for TSC and show promising results for highly adaptive control.However, existing RL-based methods suffer from notably poor real-world applicability and hardly have any successful deployments.The reasons for such failures are mostly due to the reliance on over-idealized traffic simulators for policy optimization, as well as using unrealistic fine-grained state observations and reward signals that are not directly obtainable from real-world sensors.In this paper, we propose a fully Data-Driven and simulator-free framework for realistic Traffic Signal Control (D2TSC).Specifically, we combine well-established traffic flow theory with machine learning to construct a reward inference model to infer the reward signals from coarse-grained traffic data.With the inferred rewards, we further propose a sample-efficient offline RL method to enable direct signal control policy learning from historical offline datasets of real-world intersections.To evaluate our approach, we collect historical traffic data from a real-world intersection, and develop a highly customized simulation environment that strictly follows real data characteristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approach achieves superior performance over conventional and offline RL baselines, and also enjoys much better real-world applicability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modeling animatable human avatars from RGB videos is a long-standing and challenging problem.Recent works usually adopt MLP-based neural radiance fields (NeRF) to represent 3D humans, but it remains difficult for pure MLPs to regress pose-dependent garment details.To this end, we introduce Animatable Gaussians, a new avatar representation that leverages powerful 2D CNNs and 3D Gaussian splatting to create high-fidelity avatars.To associate 3D Gaussians with the animatable avatar, we learn a parametric template from the input videos, and then parameterize the template on two front \& back canonical Gaussian maps where each pixel represents a 3D Gaussian.The learned template is adaptive to the wearing garments for modeling looser clothes like dresses.Such template-guided 2D parameterization enables us to employ a powerful StyleGAN-based CNN to learn the pose-dependent Gaussian maps for modeling detailed dynamic appearances.Furthermore, we introduce a pose projection strategy for better generalization given novel poses.Overall, our method can create lifelike avatars with dynamic, realistic and generalized appearances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>Code: https://github.com/lizhe00/AnimatableGaussians</p>

                  <p>Video-based large language models (Video-LLMs) have been recently introduced, targeting both fundamental improvements in perception and comprehension, and a diverse range of user inquiries.In pursuit of the ultimate goal of achieving artificial general intelligence, a truly intelligent Video-LLM model should not only see and understand the surroundings, but also possess human-level commonsense, and make well-informed decisions for the users.To guide the development of such a model, the establishment of a robust and comprehensive evaluation system becomes crucial.To this end, this paper proposes \textit{Video-Bench}, a new comprehensive benchmark along with a toolkit specifically designed for evaluating Video-LLMs.The benchmark comprises 10 meticulously crafted tasks, evaluating the capabilities of Video-LLMs across three distinct levels: Video-exclusive Understanding, Prior Knowledge-based Question-Answering, and Comprehension and Decision-making.In addition, we introduce an automatic toolkit tailored to process model outputs for various tasks, facilitating the calculation of metrics and generating convenient final scores.We evaluate 8 representative Video-LLMs using \textit{Video-Bench}.The findings reveal that current Video-LLMs still fall considerably short of achieving human-like comprehension and analysis of real-world videos, offering valuable insights for future research directions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The benchmark and toolkit are available at: \url{https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Video-Bench}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

                  <p>Typically, autonomous driving adopts a modular design, which divides the full stack into perception, prediction, planning and control parts.Though interpretable, such modular design tends to introduce a substantial amount of redundancy.Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLM) and diffusion techniques have demonstrated their superior performance on comprehension and generation ability.In this paper, we first introduce the concept of interleaved vision-action pair, which unifies the format of visual features and control signals.Based on the vision-action pairs, we construct a general world model based on MLLM and diffusion model for autonomous driving, termedADriver-I. It takes the vision-action pairs as inputs and autoregressively predicts the control signal of the current frame.The generated control signals together with the historical vision-action pairs are further conditioned to predict the future frames.With the predicted next frame, ADriver-I performs further control signal prediction.Such a process can be repeated infinite times, ADriver-I achieves autonomous driving in the world created by itself.Extensive experiments are conducted on nuScenes and our large-scale private datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ADriver-I shows impressive performance compared to several constructed baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>We hope our ADriver-I can provide some new insights for future autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.</p>

                  <p>Scaling the size of language models to tens of billions of parameters has led to impressive performance on a wide range of tasks.At generation, these models are used auto-regressively, requiring a forward pass for each generated token, and thus reading the full set of parameters from memory.This memory access forms the primary bottleneck for generation and it worsens as the model size increases.Moreover, executing a forward pass for multiple tokens in parallel often takes nearly the same time as it does for just one token.These two observations lead to the development of speculative sampling, where a second smaller model is used to draft a few tokens, that are then validated or rejected using a single forward pass of the large model.Unfortunately, this method requires two models that share the same tokenizer and thus limits its adoption.As an alternative, we propose to use parallel decoding as a way to draft multiple tokens from a single model with no computational cost, nor the need for a second model.Our approach only requires an additional input token that marks the words that will be generated simultaneously.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show promising performance (up to $30\%$ speed-up) while requiring only as few as $O(d_{emb})$ additional parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained substantial attention across diverse application domains and theoretical investigations.Existing literature on RL theory largely focuses on risk-neutral settings where the decision-maker learns to maximize the expected cumulative reward.However, in practical scenarios such as portfolio management and e-commerce recommendations, decision-makers often persist in heterogeneous risk preferences subject to outcome uncertainties, which can not be well-captured by the risk-neural framework.Incorporating these preferences can be approached through utility theory, yet the development of risk-sensitive RL under general utility functions remains an open question for theoretical exploration.   In this paper, we consider a scenario where the decision-maker seeks to optimize a general utility function of the cumulative reward in the framework of a Markov decision process (MDP).To facilitate the Dynamic Programming Principle and Bellman equation, we enlarge the state space with an additional dimension that accounts for the cumulative reward.We propose a discretized approximation scheme to the MDP under enlarged state space, which is tractable and key for algorithmic design.We then propose a modified value iteration algorithm that employs an epsilon-covering over the space of cumulative reward.When a simulator is accessible, our algorithm efficiently learns a near-optimal policy with guaranteed sample complexity.In the absence of a simulator, our algorithm, designed with an upper-confidence-bound exploration approach, identifies a near-optimal policy while ensuring a guaranteed regret bound.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For both algorithms, we match the theoretical lower bounds for the risk-neutral setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

A $2$-matching is any subset of the edges such that each vertex is incident to at most two edges from the subset.We present a fast combinatorial algorithm for the problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our algorithm and its analysis are dramatically simpler than the very complicated result by Hartvigsen from 1984.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>In the design of this algorithm we use several new concepts.It has been proven before that for any triangle-free $2$-matching $M$ which is not maximum the graph contains an $M$-augmenting path, whose application to $M$ results in a bigger triangle-free $2$-matching.It was not known how to efficiently find such a path.A new observation is that the search for an augmenting path $P$ can be restricted to so-called {\em amenable} paths that go through any triangle $t$ contained in $P \cup M$ a limited number of times.To find an augmenting path that is amenable and hence whose application does not create any triangle we forbid some edges to be followed by certain others.This operation can be thought of as using gadgets, in which some pairs of edges get disconnected.To be able to disconnect two edges we employ {\em half-edges}.A {\em half-edge} of edge $e$ is, informally speaking, a half of $e$ containing exactly one of its endpoints.This is another novel application of half-edges that were already been used for TSP and other matching problems.Additionally, gadgets are not fixed during any augmentation phase, but are dynamically changing according to the currently discovered state of reachability by amenable paths.</p>

                  <p>Graph pooling has been increasingly recognized as crucial for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to facilitate hierarchical graph representation learning.Existing graph pooling methods commonly consist of two stages: selecting top-ranked nodes and discarding the remaining to construct coarsened graph representations.However, this paper highlights two key issues with these methods: 1) The process of selecting nodes to discard frequently employs additional Graph Convolutional Networks or Multilayer Perceptrons, lacking a thorough evaluation of each node's impact on the final graph representation and subsequent prediction tasks.2) Current graph pooling methods tend to directly discard the noise segment (dropped) of the graph without accounting for the latent information contained within these elements.To address the first issue, we introduce a novel Graph Explicit Pooling (GrePool) method, which selects nodes by explicitly leveraging the relationships between the nodes and final representation vectors crucial for classification.The second issue is addressed using an extended version of GrePool (i.e., GrePool+), which applies a uniform loss on the discarded nodes.This addition is designed to augment the training process and improve classification accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments across 12 widely used datasets to validate our proposed method's effectiveness, including the Open Graph Benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results uniformly demonstrate that GrePool outperforms 14 baseline methods for most datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>Likewise, implementing GrePool+ enhances GrePool's performance without incurring additional computational costs.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) is the promising privacy-preserve approach to continually update the central machine learning (ML) model (e.g., object detectors in edge servers) by aggregating the gradients obtained from local observation data in distributed connected and automated vehicles (CAVs).The incentive mechanism is to incentivize individual selfish CAVs to participate in FL towards the improvement of overall model accuracy.It is, however, challenging to design the incentive mechanism, due to the complex correlation between the overall model accuracy and unknown incentive sensitivity of CAVs, especially under the non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data of individual CAVs.In this paper, we propose a new learn-to-incentivize algorithm to adaptively allocate rewards to individual CAVs under unknown sensitivity functions.First, we gradually learn the unknown sensitivity function of individual CAVs with accumulative observations, by using compute-efficient Gaussian process regression (GPR).Second, we iteratively update the reward allocation to individual CAVs with new sampled gradients, derived from GPR.Third, we project the updated reward allocations to comply with the total budget.We evaluate the performance of extensive simulations, where the simulation parameters are obtained from realistic profiling of the CIFAR-10 dataset and NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that our proposed algorithm substantially outperforms existing solutions, in terms of accuracy, scalability, and adaptability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span></p>

                  <p>Digital network twin (DNT) is a promising paradigm to replicate real-world cellular networks toward continual assessment, proactive management, and what-if analysis.Existing discussions have been focusing on using only deep learning techniques to build DNTs, which raises widespread concerns regarding their generalization, explainability, and transparency.In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to augment network simulators with context-aware neural agents.The main challenge lies in the non-trivial simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) discrepancy between offline simulators and real-world networks.To solve the challenge, we propose a new learn-to-bridge algorithm to cost-efficiently bridge the sim-to-real discrepancy in two alternative stages.In the first stage, we select states to query performances in real-world networks by using newly-designed cost-aware Bayesian optimization.In the second stage, we train the neural agent to learn the state context and bridge the probabilistic discrepancy based on Bayesian neural networks (BNN).In addition, we build a small-scale end-to-end network testbed based on OpenAirInterface RAN and Core with USRP B210 and a smartphone, and replicate the network in NS-3.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation results show that, our proposed solution substantially outperforms existing methods, with more than 92\% reduction in the sim-to-real discrepancy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span></p>

                The T-Complexity Costs of Error Correction for Control Flow in Quantum Computation

                  <p>Numerous quantum algorithms require the use of quantum error correction to overcome the intrinsic unreliability of physical qubits.However, error correction imposes a unique performance bottleneck, known as T-complexity, that can make an implementation of an algorithm as a quantum program run more slowly than on idealized hardware.In this work, we identify that programming abstractions for control flow, such as the quantum if-statement, can introduce polynomial increases in the T-complexity of a program.If not mitigated, this slowdown can diminish the computational advantage of a quantum algorithm.   To enable reasoning about the costs of control flow, we present a cost model, using which a developer can analyze the T-complexity of a program under quantum error correction and pinpoint the sources of slowdown.We also present a set of program-level optimizations, using which a developer can rewrite a program to reduce its T-complexity, predict the T-complexity of the optimized program using the cost model, and then compile it to an efficient circuit via a straightforward strategy.   We implement the program-level optimizations in Spire, an extension of the Tower quantum compiler.Using a set of 11 benchmark programs that use control flow, we show that the cost model is accurate, and that Spire's optimizations recover programs that are asymptotically efficient, meaning their runtime T-complexity under error correction is equal to their time complexity on idealized hardware.   Our results show that optimizing a program before it is compiled to a circuit can yield better results than compiling the program to an inefficient circuit and then invoking a quantum circuit optimizer found in prior work.For our benchmarks, only 2 of 8 existing circuit optimizers recover circuits with asymptotically efficient T-complexity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to these 2 optimizers, Spire uses 54x to 2400x less compile time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span></p>

                  <p>We address the task of evidence retrieval for long document question answering, which involves locating relevant paragraphs within a document to answer a question.We aim to assess the applicability of large language models (LLMs) in the task of zero-shot long document evidence retrieval, owing to their unprecedented performance across various NLP tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, currently the LLMs can consume limited context lengths as input, thus providing document chunks as inputs might overlook the global context while missing out on capturing the inter-segment dependencies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.759</span></span>Moreover, directly feeding the large input sets can incur significant computational costs, particularly when processing the entire document (and potentially incurring monetary expenses with enterprise APIs like OpenAI's GPT variants).To address these challenges, we propose a suite of techniques that exploit the discourse structure commonly found in documents.By utilizing this structure, we create a condensed representation of the document, enabling a more comprehensive understanding and analysis of relationships between different parts.We retain $99.6\%$ of the best zero-shot approach's performance, while processing only $26\%$ of the total tokens used by the best approach in the information seeking evidence retrieval setup.We also show how our approach can be combined with \textit{self-ask} reasoning agent to achieve best zero-shot performance in complex multi-hop question answering, just $\approx 4\%$ short of zero-shot performance using gold evidence.</p>

                  <p>Serverless computing is an emerging cloud paradigm that offers an elastic and scalable allocation of computing resources with pay-as-you-go billing.In the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) programming model, applications comprise short-lived and stateless serverless functions executed in isolated containers or microVMs, which can quickly scale to thousands of instances and process terabytes of data.This flexibility comes at the cost of duplicated runtimes, libraries, and user data spread across many function instances, and cloud providers do not utilize this redundancy.The memory footprint of serverless forces removing idle containers to make space for new ones, which decreases performance through more cold starts and fewer data caching opportunities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We address this issue by proposing deduplicating memory pages of serverless workers with identical content, based on the content-based page-sharing concept of Linux Kernel Same-page Merging (KSM). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>We replace the background memory scanning process of KSM, as it is too slow to locate sharing candidates in short-lived functions.Instead, we design User-Guided Page Merging (UPM), a built-in Linux kernel module that leverages the madvise system call: we enable users to advise the kernel of memory areas that can be shared with others.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that UPM reduces memory consumption by up to 55% on 16 concurrent containers executing a typical image recognition function, more than doubling the density for containers of the same function that can run on a system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Traditionally, designs are written in Verilog hardware description language (HDL) and debugged by hardware engineers.While this approach is effective, it is time-consuming and error-prone for complex designs.Large language models (LLMs) are promising in automating HDL code generation.LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, and they can learn to generate code that compiles and is functionally accurate.We aim to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate functionally correct HDL models.We build AutoChip by combining the interactive capabilities of LLMs and the output from Verilog simulations to generate Verilog modules.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We start with a design prompt for a module and the context from compilation errors and debugging messages, which highlight differences between the expected and actual outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>This ensures that accurate Verilog code can be generated without human intervention.We evaluate AutoChip using problem sets from HDLBits.We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the AutoChip using several LLMs and problem categories.The results show that incorporating context from compiler tools, such as Icarus Verilog, improves the effectiveness, yielding 24.20% more accurate Verilog.We release our evaluation scripts and datasets as open-source contributions at the following link https://github.com/shailja-thakur/AutoChip.</p>
