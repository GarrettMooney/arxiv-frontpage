                  <p>Existing approaches to video understanding, mainly designed for short videos from a third-person perspective, are limited in their applicability in certain fields, such as robotics.In this paper, we delve into open-ended question-answering (QA) in long, egocentric videos, which allows individuals or robots to inquire about their own past visual experiences.This task presents unique challenges, including the complexity of temporally grounding queries within extensive video content, the high resource demands for precise data annotation, and the inherent difficulty of evaluating open-ended answers due to their ambiguous nature.Our proposed approach tackles these challenges by (i) integrating query grounding and answering within a unified model to reduce error propagation; (ii) employing large language models for efficient and scalable data synthesis; and (iii) introducing a close-ended QA task for evaluation, to manage answer ambiguity.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the QAEgo4D and Ego4D-NLQ benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We plan to publicly release the codes, model, and constructed datasets for future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in diffusion-based models have demonstrated significant success in generating images from text.However, video editing models have not yet reached the same level of visual quality and user control.To address this, we introduce RAVE, a zero-shot video editing method that leverages pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models without additional training.RAVE takes an input video and a text prompt to produce high-quality videos while preserving the original motion and semantic structure.It employs a novel noise shuffling strategy, leveraging spatio-temporal interactions between frames, to produce temporally consistent videos faster than existing methods.It is also efficient in terms of memory requirements, allowing it to handle longer videos.RAVE is capable of a wide range of edits, from local attribute modifications to shape transformations.In order to demonstrate the versatility of RAVE, we create a comprehensive video evaluation dataset ranging from object-focused scenes to complex human activities like dancing and typing, and dynamic scenes featuring swimming fish and boats.Our qualitative and quantitative experiments highlight the effectiveness of RAVE in diverse video editing scenarios compared to existing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, dataset and videos can be found in https://rave-video.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.853</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools for open-ended image understanding tasks, including open vocabulary segmentation.Yet, direct application of such VLMs to segmentation is non-trivial, since VLMs are trained with image-text pairs and naturally lack pixel-level granularity.Recent works have made advancements in bridging this gap, often by leveraging the shared image-text space in which the image and a provided text prompt are represented.In this paper, we challenge the capabilities of VLMs further and tackle open-vocabulary segmentation without the need for any textual input.To this end, we propose a novel Self-Guided Semantic Segmentation (Self-Seg) framework.Self-Seg is capable of automatically detecting relevant class names from clustered BLIP embeddings and using these for accurate semantic segmentation.In addition, we propose an LLM-based Open-Vocabulary Evaluator (LOVE) to effectively assess predicted open-vocabulary class names.We achieve state-of-the-art results on Pascal VOC, ADE20K and CityScapes for open-vocabulary segmentation without given class names, as well as competitive performance with methods where class names are given.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and data will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the commercial abundance of UAVs, aerial data acquisition remains challenging, and the existing Asia and North America-centric open-source UAV datasets are small-scale or low-resolution and lack diversity in scene contextuality.Additionally, the color content of the scenes, solar-zenith angle, and population density of different geographies influence the data diversity.These two factors conjointly render suboptimal aerial-visual perception of the deep neural network (DNN) models trained primarily on the ground-view data, including the open-world foundational models.   To pave the way for a transformative era of aerial detection, we present Multiview Aerial Visual RECognition or MAVREC, a video dataset where we record synchronized scenes from different perspectives -- ground camera and drone-mounted camera.MAVREC consists of around 2.5 hours of industry-standard 2.7K resolution video sequences, more than 0.5 million frames, and 1.1 million annotated bounding boxes.This makes MAVREC the largest ground and aerial-view dataset, and the fourth largest among all drone-based datasets across all modalities and tasks.Through our extensive benchmarking on MAVREC, we recognize that augmenting object detectors with ground-view images from the corresponding geographical location is a superior pre-training strategy for aerial detection.Building on this strategy, we benchmark MAVREC with a curriculum-based semi-supervised object detection approach that leverages labeled (ground and aerial) and unlabeled (only aerial) images to enhance the aerial detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We publicly release the MAVREC dataset: https://mavrec.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

We outline a two-stage approach that first proposes candidate difference descriptions from image sets and then re-ranks the candidates by checking how well they can differentiate the two sets.We introduce VisDiff, which first captions the images and prompts a language model to propose candidate descriptions, then re-ranks these descriptions using CLIP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To evaluate VisDiff, we collect VisDiffBench, a dataset with 187 paired image sets with ground truth difference descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.86</span></span>We apply VisDiff to various domains, such as comparing datasets (e.g., ImageNet vs. ImageNetV2), comparing classification models (e.g., zero-shot CLIP vs. supervised ResNet), summarizing model failure modes (supervised ResNet), characterizing differences between generative models (e.g., StableDiffusionV1 and V2), and discovering what makes images memorable.Using VisDiff, we are able to find interesting and previously unknown differences in datasets and models, demonstrating its utility in revealing nuanced insights.</p>

                  <p>Dataset distillation aims to generate a smaller but representative subset from a large dataset, which allows a model to be trained efficiently, meanwhile evaluating on the original testing data distribution to achieve decent performance.Many prior works have aimed to align with diverse aspects of the original datasets, such as matching the training weight trajectories, gradient, feature/BatchNorm distributions, etc.In this work, we show how to distill various large-scale datasets such as full ImageNet-1K/21K under a conventional input resolution of 224$\times$224 to achieve the best accuracy over all previous approaches, including SRe$^2$L, TESLA and MTT.To achieve this, we introduce a simple yet effective ${\bf C}$urriculum ${\bf D}$ata ${\bf A}$ugmentation ($\texttt{CDA}$) during data synthesis that obtains the accuracy on large-scale ImageNet-1K and 21K with 63.2% under IPC (Images Per Class) 50 and 36.1% under IPC 20, respectively.Finally, we show that, by integrating all our enhancements together, the proposed model beats the current state-of-the-art by more than 4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K/21K and for the first time, reduces the gap to its full-data training counterpart to less than absolute 15%.Moreover, this work represents the inaugural success in dataset distillation on larger-scale ImageNet-21K under the standard 224$\times$224 resolution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and distilled ImageNet-21K dataset of 20 IPC, 2K recovery budget are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/SRe2L/tree/main/CDA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of commercial AI products based on generative, multi-purpose AI systems promising a unified approach to building machine learning (ML) models into technology.However, this ambition of "generality" comes at a steep cost to the environment, given the amount of energy these systems require and the amount of carbon that they emit.In this work, we propose the first systematic comparison of the ongoing inference cost of various categories of ML systems, covering both task-specific (i.e. finetuned models that carry out a single task) and `general-purpose' models, (i.e. those trained for multiple tasks).We measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these models.We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters.We conclude with a discussion around the current trend of deploying multi-purpose generative ML systems, and caution that their utility should be more intentionally weighed against increased costs in terms of energy and emissions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All the data from our study can be accessed via an interactive demo to carry out further exploration and analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span></p>

                  <p>While pre-trained large-scale vision models have shown significant promise for semantic correspondence, their features often struggle to grasp the geometry and orientation of instances.This paper identifies the importance of being geometry-aware for semantic correspondence and reveals a limitation of the features of current foundation models under simple post-processing.We show that incorporating this information can markedly enhance semantic correspondence performance with simple but effective solutions in both zero-shot and supervised settings.We also construct a new challenging benchmark for semantic correspondence built from an existing animal pose estimation dataset, for both pre-training validating models.Our method achieves a PCK@0.10 score of 64.2 (zero-shot) and 85.6 (supervised) on the challenging SPair-71k dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 4.3p and 11.0p absolute gains, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets will be publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.894</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper we tackle the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).Specifically, given a dataset with labelled and unlabelled images, the task is to cluster all images in the unlabelled subset, whether or not they belong to the labelled categories.Our first contribution is to recognize that most existing GCD benchmarks only contain labels for a single clustering of the data, making it difficult to ascertain whether models are using the available labels to solve the GCD task, or simply solving an unsupervised clustering problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As such, we present a synthetic dataset, named 'Clevr-4', for category discovery. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>Clevr-4 contains four equally valid partitions of the data, i.e based on object shape, texture, color or count.To solve the task, models are required to extrapolate the taxonomy specified by the labelled set, rather than simply latching onto a single natural grouping of the data.We use this dataset to demonstrate the limitations of unsupervised clustering in the GCD setting, showing that even very strong unsupervised models fail on Clevr-4.We further use Clevr-4 to examine the weaknesses of existing GCD algorithms, and propose a new method which addresses these shortcomings, leveraging consistent findings from the representation learning literature to do so.Our simple solution, which is based on 'mean teachers' and termed $\mu$GCD, substantially outperforms implemented baselines on Clevr-4.Finally, when we transfer these findings to real data on the challenging Semantic Shift Benchmark (SSB), we find that $\mu$GCD outperforms all prior work, setting a new state-of-the-art.For the project webpage, see https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/clevr4/</p>

                  <p>Knowing how many and where are people in various indoor spaces is critical for reducing HVAC energy waste, space management, spatial analytics and in emergency scenarios.While a range of technologies have been proposed to detect and track people in large indoor spaces, ceiling-mounted fisheye cameras have recently emerged as strong contenders.Currently, RAPiD is the SOTA algorithm for people detection in images captured by fisheye cameras.However, in large spaces several overhead fisheye cameras are needed to assure high accuracy of counting and thus multiple instances of RAPiD must be executed simultaneously.This report evaluates inference time when multiple instances of RAPiD run in parallel on an Ubuntu NUC PC with Intel I7 8559U CPU.We consider three mechanisms of CPU-resource allocation to handle multiple instances of RAPiD: 1) managed by Ubuntu, 2) managed by user via operating-system calls to assign logical cores, and 3) managed by user via PyTorch-library calls to limit the number of threads used by PyTorch.Each scenario was evaluated on 300 images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results show, that when one or two instances of RAPiD are executed in parallel all three approaches result in similar inference times of 1.8sec and 3.2sec, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>However, when three or more instances of RAPiD run in parallel, limiting the number of threads used by PyTorch results in the shortest inference times.On average, RAPiD completes inference of 2 images simultaneously in about 3sec, 4 images in 6sec and 8 images in less than 14sec.This is important for real-time system design.In HVAC-application scenarios, with a typical reaction time of 10-15min, a latency of 14sec is negligible so a single 8559U CPU can support 8 camera streams thus reducing the system cost.However, in emergency scenarios, when time is of essence, a single CPU may be needed for each camera to reduce the latency to 1.8sec.</p>

                  <p>Flexible antenna systems (FASs) can reconfigure their locations freely within a spatially continuous space.To keep favorable antenna positions, the channel state information (CSI) acquisition for FASs is essential.While some techniques have been proposed, most existing FAS channel estimators require several channel assumptions, such as slow variation and angular-domain sparsity.When these assumptions are not reasonable, the model mismatch may lead to unpredictable performance loss.In this paper, we propose the successive Bayesian reconstructor (S-BAR) as a general solution to estimate FAS channels.Unlike model-based estimators, the proposed S-BAR is prior-aided, which builds the experiential kernel for CSI acquisition.Inspired by Bayesian regression, the key idea of S-BAR is to model the FAS channels as a stochastic process, whose uncertainty can be successively eliminated by kernel-based sampling and regression.In this way, the predictive mean of the regressed stochastic process can be viewed as the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimator of FAS channels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Simulation results verify that, in both model-mismatched and model-matched cases, the proposed S-BAR can achieve higher estimation accuracy than the existing schemes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a notorious alternative to address learning problems dealing with non-Euclidean datasets.However, although most works assume that the graph is perfectly known, the observed topology is prone to errors stemming from observational noise, graph-learning limitations, or adversarial attacks.If ignored, these perturbations may drastically hinder the performance of GNNs.To address this limitation, this work proposes a robust implementation of GNNs that explicitly accounts for the presence of perturbations in the observed topology.For any task involving GNNs, our core idea is to i) solve an optimization problem not only over the learnable parameters of the GNN but also over the true graph, and ii) augment the fitting cost with a term accounting for discrepancies on the graph.Specifically, we consider a convolutional GNN based on graph filters and follow an alternating optimization approach to handle the (non-differentiable and constrained) optimization problem by combining gradient descent and projected proximal updates.The resulting algorithm is not limited to a particular type of graph and is amenable to incorporating prior information about the perturbations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we assess the performance of the proposed method through several numerical experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.776</span></span></p>

                  <p>Support Vector Machine (SVM) stands out as a prominent machine learning technique widely applied in practical pattern recognition tasks.It achieves binary classification by maximizing the "margin", which represents the minimum distance between instances and the decision boundary.Although many efforts have been dedicated to expanding SVM for multi-class case through strategies such as one versus one and one versus the rest, satisfactory solutions remain to be developed.In this paper, we propose a novel method for multi-class SVM that incorporates pairwise class loss considerations and maximizes the minimum margin.Adhering to this concept, we embrace a new formulation that imparts heightened flexibility to multi-class SVM.Furthermore, the correlations between the proposed method and multiple forms of multi-class SVM are analyzed.The proposed regularizer, akin to the concept of "margin", can serve as a seamless enhancement over the softmax in deep learning, providing guidance for network parameter learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method over existing multi-classification methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/zz-haooo/M3SVM.</p>

                  <p>Training on large-scale datasets can boost the performance of video instance segmentation while the annotated datasets for VIS are hard to scale up due to the high labor cost.What we possess are numerous isolated filed-specific datasets, thus, it is appealing to jointly train models across the aggregation of datasets to enhance data volume and diversity.However, due to the heterogeneity in category space, as mask precision increases with the data volume, simply utilizing multiple datasets will dilute the attention of models on different taxonomies.Thus, increasing the data scale and enriching taxonomy space while improving classification precision is important.In this work, we analyze that providing extra taxonomy information can help models concentrate on specific taxonomy, and propose our model named Taxonomy-aware Multi-dataset Joint Training for Video Instance Segmentation (TMT-VIS) to address this vital challenge.Specifically, we design a two-stage taxonomy aggregation module that first compiles taxonomy information from input videos and then aggregates these taxonomy priors into instance queries before the transformer decoder.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experimental evaluations on four popular and challenging benchmarks, including YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and UVO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our model shows significant improvement over the baseline solutions, and sets new state-of-the-art records on all benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>These appealing and encouraging results demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.The code is available at https://github.com/rkzheng99/TMT-VIS(https://github.com/rkzheng99/TMT-VIS)</p>

                  <p>Multicasting is a vital information dissemination technique in Software-Defined Networking (SDN).With SDN, a multicast service can incorporate network functions implemented at different nodes, which is referred to as software-defined multicast.Emerging ubiquitous wireless networks for 5G and Beyond (B5G) inherently support multicast.However, the broadcast nature of wireless channels, especially in dense deployments, leads to neighborhood interference as a primary system degradation factor, which introduces a new challenge for software-defined multicast in wireless mesh networks.To tackle this, this paper introduces a novel approach, based on the idea of minimizing both the total length cost of the multicast tree and the interference at the same time.Accordingly, a bicriteria optimization problem is formulated, which is called \emph{Minimum Interference Steiner Tree (MIST)}.To solve the bicriteria problem, instead of resorting to heuristics, this paper employs an innovative approach that is an approximate algorithm for MIST but with guaranteed performance.Specifically, the approach is a two-stage relaxation algorithm by exploiting the monotone submodularity property of the interference metric and identifying Pareto optimal solutions for MIST.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Simulation results demonstrate and validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span></p>

                  <p>In real life, various degradation scenarios exist that might damage document images, making it harder to recognize and analyze them, thus binarization is a fundamental and crucial step for achieving the most optimal performance in any document analysis task.We propose DocBinFormer (Document Binarization Transformer), a novel two-level vision transformer (TL-ViT) architecture based on vision transformers for effective document image binarization.The presented architecture employs a two-level transformer encoder to effectively capture both global and local feature representation from the input images.These complimentary bi-level features are exploited for efficient document image binarization, resulting in improved results for system-generated as well as handwritten document images in a comprehensive approach.With the absence of convolutional layers, the transformer encoder uses the pixel patches and sub-patches along with their positional information to operate directly on them, while the decoder generates a clean (binarized) output image from the latent representation of the patches.Instead of using a simple vision transformer block to extract information from the image patches, the proposed architecture uses two transformer blocks for greater coverage of the extracted feature space on a global and local scale.The encoded feature representation is used by the decoder block to generate the corresponding binarized output.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on a variety of DIBCO and H-DIBCO benchmarks show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on four metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>The source code will be made available at https://github.com/RisabBiswas/DocBinFormer.</p>

                  <p>Image keypoint descriptions that are discriminative and matchable over large changes in viewpoint are vital for 3D reconstruction.However, descriptions output by learned descriptors are typically not robust to camera rotation.While they can be made more robust by, e.g., data augmentation, this degrades performance on upright images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Another approach is test-time augmentation, which incurs a significant increase in runtime. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>We instead learn a linear transform in description space that encodes rotations of the input image.We call this linear transform a steerer since it allows us to transform the descriptions as if the image was rotated.From representation theory we know all possible steerers for the rotation group.Steerers can be optimized (A) given a fixed descriptor, (B) jointly with a descriptor or (C) we can optimize a descriptor given a fixed steerer.We perform experiments in all of these three settings and obtain state-of-the-art results on the rotation invariant image matching benchmarks AIMS and Roto-360.We publish code and model weights at github.com/georg-bn/rotation-steerers.</p>

                  <p>Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear (with respect to output length) inference complexity.Recent works such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and TransNormerLLM (Qin et al., 2023a) observe that adding a global decay term to the additive RNN update rule greatly improves performance, sometimes outperforming standard Transformers with softmax attention when trained at scale.In this work we show that adding a data-dependent gating mechanism further improves performance.We derive a parallel form of this gated linear attention layer that enables efficient training.However, a straightforward, numerically stable implementation of this parallel form requires generalized matrix multiplications in log-space for numerical stability, and thus cannot take advantage of tensor cores on modern GPUs which are optimized for standard matrix multiplications.We develop a hardware-efficient version of the parallel form that can still make use of tensor cores through block-parallel computations over sequence chunks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on moderate-scale language modeling (340M-parameter models trained on 15B tokens, 1.3B-parameter models trained on 100B tokens) show that gated linear attention (GLA) Transformers perform competitively against a strong LLaMA-architecture Transformer baseline (Touvron et al., 2023) as well as Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023), a recently introduced state-space model with a data-dependent state transition mechanism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>For training speed, our Triton-based implementation performs comparably to CUDA-optimized FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) under the regular 2048 training length setting, while outperforming FlashAttention-2when training on longer sequences beyond 4096.</p>

                  <p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools for open-ended image understanding tasks, including open vocabulary segmentation.Yet, direct application of such VLMs to segmentation is non-trivial, since VLMs are trained with image-text pairs and naturally lack pixel-level granularity.Recent works have made advancements in bridging this gap, often by leveraging the shared image-text space in which the image and a provided text prompt are represented.In this paper, we challenge the capabilities of VLMs further and tackle open-vocabulary segmentation without the need for any textual input.To this end, we propose a novel Self-Guided Semantic Segmentation (Self-Seg) framework.Self-Seg is capable of automatically detecting relevant class names from clustered BLIP embeddings and using these for accurate semantic segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we propose an LLM-based Open-Vocabulary Evaluator (LOVE) to effectively assess predicted open-vocabulary class names. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>We achieve state-of-the-art results on Pascal VOC, ADE20K and CityScapes for open-vocabulary segmentation without given class names, as well as competitive performance with methods where class names are given.All code and data will be released.</p>

                  <p>Worked examples (solutions to typical programming problems presented as a source code in a certain language and are used to explain the topics from a programming class) are among the most popular types of learning content in programming classes.Most approaches and tools for presenting these examples to students are based on line-by-line explanations of the example code.However, instructors rarely have time to provide line-by-line explanations for a large number of examples typically used in a programming class.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we explore and assess a human-AI collaboration approach to authoring worked examples for Java programming. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>We introduce an authoring system for creating Java worked examples that generates a starting version of code explanations and presents it to the instructor to edit if necessary.We also present a study that assesses the quality of explanations created with this approach.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of open-source ML libraries such as TensorFlow and Google Auto ML has enabled developers to harness state-of-the-art ML algorithms with minimal overhead.However, during this accelerated ML development process, said developers may often make sub-optimal design and implementation decisions, leading to the introduction of technical debt that, if not addressed promptly, can have a significant impact on the quality of the ML-based software.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Developers frequently acknowledge these sub-optimal design and development choices through code comments during software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>These comments, which often highlight areas requiring additional work or refinement in the future, are known as self-admitted technical debt (SATD).This paper aims to investigate SATD in ML code by analyzing 318 open-source ML projects across five domains, along with 318 non-ML projects.We detected SATD in source code comments throughout the different project snapshots, conducted a manual analysis of the identified SATD sample to comprehend the nature of technical debt in the ML code, and performed a survival analysis of the SATD to understand the evolution of such debts.We observed: i) Machine learning projects have a median percentage of SATD that is twice the median percentage of SATD in non-machine learning projects.ii) ML pipeline components for data preprocessing and model generation logic are more susceptible to debt than model validation and deployment components.iii) SATDs appear in ML projects earlier in the development process compared to non-ML projects.iv) Long-lasting SATDs are typically introduced during extensive code changes that span multiple files exhibiting low complexity.</p>
