                  <p>Large archival collections, such as email or government documents, must be manually reviewed to identify any sensitive information before the collection can be released publicly.Sensitivity classification has received a lot of attention in the literature.However, more recently, there has been increasing interest in developing sensitivity-aware search engines that can provide users with relevant search results, while ensuring that no sensitive documents are returned to the user.Sensitivity-aware search would mitigate the need for a manual sensitivity review prior to collections being made available publicly.To develop such systems, there is a need for test collections that contain relevance assessments for a set of information needs as well as ground-truth labels for a variety of sensitivity categories.The well-known Enron email collection contains a classification ground-truth that can be used to represent sensitive information, e.g., the Purely Personal and Personal but in Professional Context categories can be used to represent sensitive personal information.However, the existing Enron collection does not contain a set of information needs and relevance assessments.In this work, we present a collection of fifty information needs (topics) with crowdsourced query formulations (3 per topic) and relevance assessments (11,471 in total) for the Enron collection (mean number of relevant documents per topic = 11, variance = 34.7).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The developed information needs, queries and relevance judgements are available on GitHub and will be available along with the existing Enron collection through the popular ir_datasets library. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>Our proposed collection results in the first freely available test collection for developing sensitivity-aware search systems.</p>

                  <p>The argument sufficiency assessment task aims to determine if the premises of a given argument support its conclusion.To tackle this task, existing works often train a classifier on data annotated by humans.However, annotating data is laborious, and annotations are often inconsistent due to subjective criteria.Motivated by the probability of sufficiency (PS) definition in the causal literature, we propose CASA, a zero-shot causality-driven argument sufficiency assessment framework.PS measures how likely introducing the premise event would lead to the conclusion, when both the premise and conclusion events are absent.To estimate this probability, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to generate contexts that are inconsistent with the premise and conclusion, and revise them by injecting the premise event.Experiments on two logical fallacy detection datasets demonstrate that CASA accurately identifies insufficient arguments.We further deploy CASA in a writing assistance application, and find that suggestions generated by CASA enhance the sufficiency of student-written arguments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/xxxiaol/CASA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision and vision-language applications of neural networks, such as image classification and captioning, rely on large-scale annotated datasets that require non-trivial data-collecting processes.This time-consuming endeavor hinders the emergence of large-scale datasets, limiting researchers and practitioners to a small number of choices.Therefore, we seek more efficient ways to collect and annotate images.Previous initiatives have gathered captions from HTML alt-texts and crawled social media postings, but these data sources suffer from noise, sparsity, or subjectivity.For this reason, we turn to commercial shopping websites whose data meet three criteria: cleanliness, informativeness, and fluency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the Let's Go Shopping (LGS) dataset, a large-scale public dataset with 15 million image-caption pairs from publicly available e-commerce websites. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.865</span></span>When compared with existing general-domain datasets, the LGS images focus on the foreground object and have less complex backgrounds.Our experiments on LGS show that the classifiers trained on existing benchmark datasets do not readily generalize to e-commerce data, while specific self-supervised visual feature extractors can better generalize.Furthermore, LGS's high-quality e-commerce-focused images and bimodal nature make it advantageous for vision-language bi-modal tasks: LGS enables image-captioning models to generate richer captions and helps text-to-image generation models achieve e-commerce style transfer.</p>

                  <p>We present a novel framework for 3D object-centric representation learning.Our approach effectively decomposes complex scenes into individual objects from a single image in an unsupervised fashion.This method, called slot-guided Volumetric Object Radiance Fields (sVORF), composes volumetric object radiance fields with object slots as a guidance to implement unsupervised 3D scene decomposition.Specifically, sVORF obtains object slots from a single image via a transformer module, maps these slots to volumetric object radiance fields with a hypernetwork and composes object radiance fields with the guidance of object slots at a 3D location.Moreover, sVORF significantly reduces memory requirement due to small-sized pixel rendering during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing top results in scene decomposition and generation tasks of complex synthetic datasets (e.g., Room-Diverse). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span>Furthermore, we also confirm the potential of sVORF to segment objects in real-world scenes (e.g., the LLFF dataset).We hope our approach can provide preliminary understanding of the physical world and help ease future research in 3D object-centric representation learning.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of text-to-image generative models has revolutionized the field of deepfakes, enabling the creation of realistic and convincing visual content directly from textual descriptions.However, this advancement presents considerably greater challenges in detecting the authenticity of such content.Existing deepfake detection datasets and methods often fall short in effectively capturing the extensive range of emerging deepfakes and offering satisfactory explanatory information for detection.To address the significant issue, this paper introduces a deepfake database (DFLIP-3K) for the development of convincing and explainable deepfake detection.It encompasses about 300K diverse deepfake samples from approximately 3K generative models, which boasts the largest number of deepfake models in the literature.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, it collects around 190K linguistic footprints of these deepfakes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>The two distinguished features enable DFLIP-3K to develop a benchmark that promotes progress in linguistic profiling of deepfakes, which includes three sub-tasks namely deepfake detection, model identification, and prompt prediction.The deepfake model and prompt are two essential components of each deepfake, and thus dissecting them linguistically allows for an invaluable exploration of trustworthy and interpretable evidence in deepfake detection, which we believe is the key for the next-generation deepfake detection.Furthermore, DFLIP-3K is envisioned as an open database that fosters transparency and encourages collaborative efforts to further enhance its growth.Our extensive experiments on the developed benchmark verify that our DFLIP-3K database is capable of serving as a standardized resource for evaluating and comparing linguistic-based deepfake detection, identification, and prompt prediction techniques.</p>

                  <p>Defending from cyberattacks requires practitioners to operate on high-level adversary behavior.Cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports on past cyberattack incidents describe the chain of malicious actions with respect to time.To avoid repeating cyberattack incidents, practitioners must proactively identify and defend against recurring chain of actions - which we refer to as temporal attack patterns.Automatically mining the patterns among actions provides structured and actionable information on the adversary behavior of past cyberattacks.The goal of this paper is to aid security practitioners in prioritizing and proactive defense against cyberattacks by mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence reports.To this end, we propose ChronoCTI, an automated pipeline for mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports of past cyberattacks.To construct ChronoCTI, we build the ground truth dataset of temporal attack patterns and apply state-of-the-art large language models, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We apply ChronoCTI on a set of 713 CTI reports, where we identify 124 temporal attack patterns - which we categorize into nine pattern categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>We identify that the most prevalent pattern category is to trick victim users into executing malicious code to initiate the attack, followed by bypassing the anti-malware system in the victim network.Based on the observed patterns, we advocate organizations to train users about cybersecurity best practices, introduce immutable operating systems with limited functionalities, and enforce multi-user authentications.Moreover, we advocate practitioners to leverage the automated mining capability of ChronoCTI and design countermeasures against the recurring attack patterns.</p>

                  <p>Crowd counting has gained significant popularity due to its practical applications.However, mainstream counting methods ignore precise individual localization and suffer from annotation noise because of counting from estimating density maps.Additionally, they also struggle with high-density images.To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end model called Fine-Grained Extraction Network (FGENet).Different from methods estimating density maps, FGENet directly learns the original coordinate points that represent the precise localization of individuals.This study designs a fusion module, named Fine-Grained Feature Pyramid(FGFP), that is used to fuse feature maps extracted by the backbone of FGENet.The fused features are then passed to both regression and classification heads, where the former provides predicted point coordinates for a given image, and the latter determines the confidence level for each predicted point being an individual.At the end, FGENet establishes correspondences between prediction points and ground truth points by employing the Hungarian algorithm.For training FGENet, we design a robust loss function, named Three-Task Combination (TTC), to mitigate the impact of annotation noise.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments are conducted on four widely used crowd counting datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FGENet.Notably, our method achieves a remarkable improvement of 3.14 points in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the ShanghaiTech Part A dataset, showcasing its superiority over the existing state-of-the-art methods.Even more impressively, FGENet surpasses previous benchmarks on the UCF\_CC\_50 dataset with an astounding enhancement of 30.16 points in MAE.</p>

                  <p>Dual-lens super-resolution (SR) is a practical scenario for reference (Ref) based SR by utilizing the telephoto image (Ref) to assist the super-resolution of the low-resolution wide-angle image (LR input).Different from general RefSR, the Ref in dual-lens SR only covers the overlapped field of view (FoV) area.However, current dual-lens SR methods rarely utilize these specific characteristics and directly perform dense matching between the LR input and Ref.Due to the resolution gap between LR and Ref, the matching may miss the best-matched candidate and destroy the consistent structures in the overlapped FoV area.Different from them, we propose to first align the Ref with the center region (namely the overlapped FoV area) of the LR input by combining global warping and local warping to make the aligned Ref be sharp and consistent.Then, we formulate the aligned Ref and LR center as value-key pairs, and the corner region of the LR is formulated as queries.In this way, we propose a kernel-free matching strategy by matching between the LR-corner (query) and LR-center (key) regions, and the corresponding aligned Ref (value) can be warped to the corner region of the target.Our kernel-free matching strategy avoids the resolution gap between LR and Ref, which makes our network have better generalization ability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we construct a DuSR-Real dataset with (LR, Ref, HR) triples, where the LR and HR are well aligned. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span>Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the second-best method by a large margin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Craigie-Hill/KeDuSR. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present Unified-IO 2, the first autoregressive multimodal model that is capable of understanding and generating image, text, audio, and action.To unify different modalities, we tokenize inputs and outputs -- images, text, audio, action, bounding boxes, etc., into a shared semantic space and then process them with a single encoder-decoder transformer model.Since training with such diverse modalities is challenging, we propose various architectural improvements to stabilize model training.We train our model from scratch on a large multimodal pre-training corpus from diverse sources with a multimodal mixture of denoisers objective.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To learn an expansive set of skills, such as following multimodal instructions, we construct and finetune on an ensemble of 120 datasets with prompts and augmentations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>With a single unified model, Unified-IO 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GRIT benchmark and strong results in more than 35 benchmarks, including image generation and understanding, natural language understanding, video and audio understanding, and robotic manipulation.We release all our models to the research community.</p>

                  <p>3D hand tracking from a monocular video is a very challenging problem due to hand interactions, occlusions, left-right hand ambiguity, and fast motion.Most existing methods rely on RGB inputs, which have severe limitations under low-light conditions and suffer from motion blur.In contrast, event cameras capture local brightness changes instead of full image frames and do not suffer from the described effects.Unfortunately, existing image-based techniques cannot be directly applied to events due to significant differences in the data modalities.In response to these challenges, this paper introduces the first framework for 3D tracking of two fast-moving and interacting hands from a single monocular event camera.Our approach tackles the left-right hand ambiguity with a novel semi-supervised feature-wise attention mechanism and integrates an intersection loss to fix hand collisions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate advances in this research domain, we release a new synthetic large-scale dataset of two interacting hands, Ev2Hands-S, and a new real benchmark with real event streams and ground-truth 3D annotations, Ev2Hands-R. Our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of the 3D reconstruction accuracy and generalises to real data under severe light conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span></p>

                  <p>In modern machine learning, the trend of harnessing self-supervised learning to derive high-quality representations without label dependency has garnered significant attention.However, the absence of label information, coupled with the inherently high-dimensional nature, improves the difficulty for the interpretation of learned representations.Consequently, indirect evaluations become the popular metric for evaluating the quality of these features, leading to a biased validation of the learned representation rationale.To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Concept-based Explainable Image Representation (CEIR).Initially, using the Concept-based Model (CBM) incorporated with pretrained CLIP and concepts generated by GPT-4, we project input images into a concept vector space.Subsequently, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) learns the latent representation from these projected concepts, which serves as the final image representation.Due to the capability of the representation to encapsulate high-level, semantically relevant concepts, the model allows for attributions to a human-comprehensible concept space.This not only enhances interpretability but also preserves the robustness essential for downstream tasks.For instance, our method exhibits state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering performance on benchmarks such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10.Furthermore, capitalizing on the universality of human conceptual understanding, CEIR can seamlessly extract the related concept from open-world images without fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This offers a fresh approach to automatic label generation and label manipulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>The automation of code review has been tackled by several researchers with the goal of reducing its cost.The adoption of deep learning in software engineering pushed the automation to new boundaries, with techniques imitating developers in generative tasks, such as commenting on a code change as a reviewer would do or addressing a reviewer's comment by modifying code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The performance of these techniques is usually assessed through quantitative metrics, e.g., the percentage of instances in the test set for which correct predictions are generated, leaving many open questions on the techniques' capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>For example, knowing that an approach is able to correctly address a reviewer's comment in 10% of cases is of little value without knowing what was asked by the reviewer:What if in all successful cases the code change required to address the comment was just the removal of an empty line?In this paper we aim at characterizing the cases in which three code review automation techniques tend to succeed or fail in the two above-described tasks.The study has a strong qualitative focus, with ~105 man-hours of manual inspection invested in manually analyzing correct and wrong predictions generated by the three techniques, for a total of 2,291 inspected predictions.The output of this analysis are two taxonomies reporting, for each of the two tasks, the types of code changes on which the experimented techniques tend to succeed or to fail, pointing to areas for future work.A result of our manual analysis was also the identification of several issues in the datasets used to train and test the experimented techniques.Finally, we assess the importance of researching in techniques specialized for code review automation by comparing their performance with ChatGPT, a general purpose large language model, finding that ChatGPT struggles in commenting code as a human reviewer would do.</p>

                  <p>Purpose: Body composition measurements from routine abdominal CT can yield personalized risk assessments for asymptomatic and diseased patients.In particular, attenuation and volume measures of muscle and fat are associated with important clinical outcomes, such as cardiovascular events, fractures, and death.This study evaluates the reliability of an Internal tool for the segmentation of muscle and fat (subcutaneous and visceral) as compared to the well-established public TotalSegmentator tool.   Methods: We assessed the tools across 900 CT series from the publicly available SAROS dataset, focusing on muscle, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat.The Dice score was employed to assess accuracy in subcutaneous fat and muscle segmentation.Due to the lack of ground truth segmentations for visceral fat, Cohen's Kappa was utilized to assess segmentation agreement between the tools.   Results:Our Internal tool achieved a 3% higher Dice (83.8 vs. 80.8) for subcutaneous fat and a 5% improvement (87.6 vs. 83.2) for muscle segmentation respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that our results were statistically different with p<0.01. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>For visceral fat, the Cohen's kappa score of 0.856 indicated near-perfect agreement between the two tools.Our internal tool also showed very strong correlations for muscle volume (R^2=0.99), muscle attenuation (R^2=0.93), and subcutaneous fat volume (R^2=0.99) with a moderate correlation for subcutaneous fat attenuation (R^2=0.45).   Conclusion: Our findings indicated that our Internal tool outperformed TotalSegmentator in measuring subcutaneous fat and muscle.The high Cohen's Kappa score for visceral fat suggests a reliable level of agreement between the two tools.These results demonstrate the potential of our tool in advancing the accuracy of body composition analysis.</p>

                  <p>Existing photorealistic relightable hand models require extensive identity-specific observations in different views, poses, and illuminations, and face challenges in generalizing to natural illuminations and novel identities.To bridge this gap, we present URHand, the first universal relightable hand model that generalizes across viewpoints, poses, illuminations, and identities.Our model allows few-shot personalization using images captured with a mobile phone, and is ready to be photorealistically rendered under novel illuminations.To simplify the personalization process while retaining photorealism, we build a powerful universal relightable prior based on neural relighting from multi-view images of hands captured in a light stage with hundreds of identities.The key challenge is scaling the cross-identity training while maintaining personalized fidelity and sharp details without compromising generalization under natural illuminations.To this end, we propose a spatially varying linear lighting model as the neural renderer that takes physics-inspired shading as input feature.By removing non-linear activations and bias, our specifically designed lighting model explicitly keeps the linearity of light transport.This enables single-stage training from light-stage data while generalizing to real-time rendering under arbitrary continuous illuminations across diverse identities.In addition, we introduce the joint learning of a physically based model and our neural relighting model, which further improves fidelity and generalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of both quality and generalizability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>We also demonstrate quick personalization of URHand from a short phone scan of an unseen identity.</p>

                  <p>The objective of sign language recognition is to bridge the communication gap between the deaf and the hearing.Numerous previous works train their models using the well-established connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss.During the inference stage, the CTC-based models typically take the entire sign video as input to make predictions.This type of inference scheme is referred to as offline recognition.In contrast, while mature speech recognition systems can efficiently recognize spoken words on the fly, sign language recognition still falls short due to the lack of practical online solutions.In this work, we take the first step towards filling this gap.Our approach comprises three phases: 1) developing a sign language dictionary encompassing all glosses present in a target sign language dataset; 2) training an isolated sign language recognition model on augmented signs using both conventional classification loss and our novel saliency loss; 3) employing a sliding window approach on the input sign sequence and feeding each sign clip to the well-optimized model for online recognition.Furthermore, our online recognition model can be extended to boost the performance of any offline model, and to support online translation by appending a gloss-to-text network onto the recognition model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By integrating our online framework with the previously best-performing offline model, TwoStream-SLR, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks: Phoenix-2014, Phoenix-2014T, and CSL-Daily. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Code and models will be available at https://github.com/FangyunWei/SLRT</p>

                  <p>Data races are egregious parallel programming bugs on CPUs.They are even worse on GPUs due to the hierarchical thread and memory structure, which makes it possible to write code that is correctly synchronized within a thread group while not being correct across groups.Thus far, all major data-race checkers for GPUs suffer from at least one of the following problems: they do not check races in global memory, do not work on recent GPUs, scale poorly, have not been extensively tested, miss simple data races, or are not dependable without detailed knowledge of the compiler.   Our new data-race detection tool, HiRace, overcomes these limitations.Its key novelty is an innovative parallel finite-state machine that condenses an arbitrarily long access history into a constant-length state, thus allowing it to handle large and long-running programs.HiRace is a dynamic tool that checks for thread-group shared memory and global device memory races.It utilizes source-code instrumentation, thus avoiding driver, compiler, and hardware dependencies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate it on a modern calibrated data-race benchmark suite. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>On the 580 tested CUDA kernels, 346 of which contain data races, HiRace finds races missed by other tools without false alarms and is more than 10 times faster on average than the current state of the art, while incurring only half the memory overhead.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, researchers combine both audio and video signals to deal with challenges where actions are not well represented or captured by visual cues.However, how to effectively leverage the two modalities is still under development.In this work, we develop a multiscale multimodal Transformer (MMT) that leverages hierarchical representation learning.Particularly, MMT is composed of a novel multiscale audio Transformer (MAT) and a multiscale video Transformer [43].To learn a discriminative cross-modality fusion, we further design multimodal supervised contrastive objectives called audio-video contrastive loss (AVC) and intra-modal contrastive loss (IMC) that robustly align the two modalities.MMT surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches by 7.3% and 2.1% on Kinetics-Sounds and VGGSound in terms of the top-1 accuracy without external training data.Moreover, the proposed MAT significantly outperforms AST<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[28] by 22.2%, 4.4% and 4.7% on three public benchmark datasets, and is about 3% more efficient based on the number of FLOPs and 9.8% more efficient based on GPU memory usage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span></p>

                  <p>Language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have been very effective in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining tasks including text classification.However, some tasks still pose challenges for these models, including text classification with limited labels.This can result in a cold-start problem.Although some approaches have attempted to address this problem through single-stage clustering as an intermediate training step coupled with a pre-trained language model, which generates pseudo-labels to improve classification, these methods are often error-prone due to the limitations of the clustering algorithms.To overcome this, we have developed a novel two-stage intermediate clustering with subsequent fine-tuning that models the pseudo-labels reliably, resulting in reduced prediction errors.The key novelty in our model, IDoFew, is that the two-stage clustering coupled with two different clustering algorithms helps exploit the advantages of the complementary algorithms that reduce the errors in generating reliable pseudo-labels for fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach has shown significant improvements compared to strong comparative models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span></p>

                  <p>Implicit neural networks have emerged as a crucial technology in 3D surface reconstruction.To reconstruct continuous surfaces from discrete point clouds, encoding the input points into regular grid features (plane or volume) has been commonly employed in existing approaches.However, these methods typically use the grid as an index for uniformly scattering point features.Compared with the irregular point features, the regular grid features may sacrifice some reconstruction details but improve efficiency.To take full advantage of these two types of features, we introduce a novel and high-efficiency attention mechanism between the grid and point features named Point-Grid Transformer (GridFormer).This mechanism treats the grid as a transfer point connecting the space and point cloud.Our method maximizes the spatial expressiveness of grid features and maintains computational efficiency.Furthermore, optimizing predictions over the entire space could potentially result in blurred boundaries.To address this issue, we further propose a boundary optimization strategy incorporating margin binary cross-entropy loss and boundary sampling.This approach enables us to achieve a more precise representation of the object structure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments validate that our method is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under widely used benchmarks by producing more precise geometry reconstructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/list17/GridFormer.</p>

                  <p>Foundational vision-language models such as CLIP are becoming a new paradigm in vision, due to their excellent generalization abilities.However, adapting these models for downstream tasks while maintaining their generalization remains a challenge.In literature, one branch of methods adapts CLIP by learning prompts using visual information.While effective, most of these works require labeled data which is not practical, and often struggle to generalize towards new datasets due to over-fitting on the source data.An alternative approach resorts to training-free methods by generating class descriptions from large language models (LLMs) and perform prompt ensembling.However, these methods often generate class specific prompts that cannot be transferred to other classes, which incur higher costs by generating LLM descriptions for each class separately.In this work, we propose to combine the strengths of these both streams of methods by learning prompts using only text data derived from LLMs.As supervised training of prompts is not trivial due to absence of images, we develop a training approach that allows prompts to extract rich contextual knowledge from LLM data.Moreover, with LLM contextual data mapped within the learned prompts, it enables zero-shot transfer of prompts to new classes and datasets potentially cutting the LLM prompt engineering cost.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that learns generalized prompts using text only data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform extensive evaluations on 4 benchmarks where our method improves over prior ensembling works while being competitive to those utilizing labeled images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/muzairkhattak/ProText.</p>

                  <p>Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) is challenging due to the significant cross-modality discrepancies between visible and infrared images.While existing methods have focused on designing complex network architectures or using metric learning constraints to learn modality-invariant features, they often overlook which specific component of the image causes the modality discrepancy problem.In this paper, we first reveal that the difference in the amplitude component of visible and infrared images is the primary factor that causes the modality discrepancy and further propose a novel Frequency Domain modality-invariant feature learning framework (FDMNet) to reduce modality discrepancy from the frequency domain perspective.Our framework introduces two novel modules, namely the Instance-Adaptive Amplitude Filter (IAF) module and the Phrase-Preserving Normalization (PPNorm) module, to enhance the modality-invariant amplitude component and suppress the modality-specific component at both the image- and feature-levels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results on two standard benchmarks, SYSU-MM01 and RegDB, demonstrate the superior performance of our FDMNet against state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>With an aging population, numerous assistive and monitoring technologies are under development to enable older adults to age in place.To facilitate aging in place predicting risk factors such as falls, and hospitalization and providing early interventions are important.Much of the work on ambient monitoring for risk prediction has centered on gait speed analysis, utilizing privacy-preserving sensors like radar.Despite compelling evidence that monitoring step length, in addition to gait speed, is crucial for predicting risk, radar-based methods have not explored step length measurement in the home.Furthermore, laboratory experiments on step length measurement using radars are limited to proof of concept studies with few healthy subjects.To address this gap, a radar-based step length measurement system for the home is proposed based on detection and tracking using radar point cloud, followed by Doppler speed profiling of the torso to obtain step lengths in the home.The proposed method was evaluated in a clinical environment, involving 35 frail older adults, to establish its validity.Additionally, the method was assessed in people's homes, with 21 frail older adults who had participated in the clinical assessment.The proposed radar-based step length measurement method was compared to the gold standard Zeno Walkway Gait Analysis System, revealing a 4.5cm/8.3% error in a clinical setting.Furthermore, it exhibited excellent reliability (ICC(2,k)=0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96) in uncontrolled home settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The method also proved accurate in uncontrolled home settings, as indicated by a strong agreement (ICC(3,k)=0.81 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92)) between home measurements and in-clinic assessments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper aims to tackle the problem of modeling dynamic urban street scenes from monocular videos.Recent methods extend NeRF by incorporating tracked vehicle poses to animate vehicles, enabling photo-realistic view synthesis of dynamic urban street scenes.However, significant limitations are their slow training and rendering speed, coupled with the critical need for high precision in tracked vehicle poses.We introduce Street Gaussians, a new explicit scene representation that tackles all these limitations.Specifically, the dynamic urban street is represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic logits and 3D Gaussians, each associated with either a foreground vehicle or the background.To model the dynamics of foreground object vehicles, each object point cloud is optimized with optimizable tracked poses, along with a dynamic spherical harmonics model for the dynamic appearance.The explicit representation allows easy composition of object vehicles and background, which in turn allows for scene editing operations and rendering at 133 FPS (1066$\times$1600 resolution) within half an hour of training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method is evaluated on multiple challenging benchmarks, including KITTI and Waymo Open datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>Furthermore, the proposed representation delivers performance on par with that achieved using precise ground-truth poses, despite relying only on poses from an off-the-shelf tracker.The code is available at https://zju3dv.github.io/street_gaussians/.</p>

                  <p>With the increasing demand for computing capability given limited resource and power budgets, it is crucial to deploy applications to customized accelerators like FPGAs.However, FPGA programming is non-trivial.Although existing high-level synthesis (HLS) tools improve productivity to a certain extent, they are limited in scope and capability to support sufficient FPGA-oriented optimizations.This paper focuses on FPGA-based accelerators and proposes POM, an optimizing framework built on multi-level intermediate representation (MLIR).POM has several features which demonstrate its scope and capability of performance optimization.First, most HLS tools depend exclusively on a single-level IR to perform all the optimizations, introducing excessive information into the IR and making debugging an arduous task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, POM introduces three layers of IR to perform operations at suitable abstraction levels, streamlining the implementation and debugging process and exhibiting better flexibility, extensibility, and systematicness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Second, POM integrates the polyhedral model into MLIR, enabling advanced dependence analysis and various FPGA-oriented loop transformations.By representing nested loops with integer sets and maps, loop transformations can be conducted conveniently through manipulations on polyhedral semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, to further relieve design effort, POM has a user-friendly programming interface (DSL) that allows a concise description of computation and includes a rich collection of scheduling primitives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>An automatic design space exploration (DSE) engine is provided to search for high-performance optimization schemes efficiently and generate optimized accelerators automatically.Experimental results show that POM achieves a $6.46\times$ average speedup on typical benchmark suites and a $6.06\times$ average speedup on real-world applications compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models have achieved great success in image generation tasks through iterative noise estimation.However, the heavy denoising process and complex neural networks hinder their low-latency applications in real-world scenarios.Quantization can effectively reduce model complexity, and post-training quantization (PTQ), which does not require fine-tuning, is highly promising in accelerating the denoising process.Unfortunately, we find that due to the highly dynamic distribution of activations in different denoising steps, existing PTQ methods for diffusion models suffer from distribution mismatch issues at both calibration sample level and reconstruction output level, which makes the performance far from satisfactory, especially in low-bit cases.In this paper, we propose Enhanced Distribution Alignment for Post-Training Quantization of Diffusion Models (EDA-DM) to address the above issues.Specifically, at the calibration sample level, we select calibration samples based on the density and diversity in the latent space, thus facilitating the alignment of their distribution with the overall samples; and at the reconstruction output level, we propose Fine-grained Block Reconstruction, which can align the outputs of the quantized model and the full-precision model at different network granularity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDA-DM outperforms the existing post-training quantization frameworks in both unconditional and conditional generation scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>At low-bit precision, the quantized models with our method even outperform the full-precision models on most datasets.</p>

                  <p>Data races are egregious parallel programming bugs on CPUs.They are even worse on GPUs due to the hierarchical thread and memory structure, which makes it possible to write code that is correctly synchronized within a thread group while not being correct across groups.Thus far, all major data-race checkers for GPUs suffer from at least one of the following problems: they do not check races in global memory, do not work on recent GPUs, scale poorly, have not been extensively tested, miss simple data races, or are not dependable without detailed knowledge of the compiler.   Our new data-race detection tool, HiRace, overcomes these limitations.Its key novelty is an innovative parallel finite-state machine that condenses an arbitrarily long access history into a constant-length state, thus allowing it to handle large and long-running programs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>HiRace is a dynamic tool that checks for thread-group shared memory and global device memory races. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>It utilizes source-code instrumentation, thus avoiding driver, compiler, and hardware dependencies.We evaluate it on a modern calibrated data-race benchmark suite.On the 580 tested CUDA kernels, 346 of which contain data races, HiRace finds races missed by other tools without false alarms and is more than 10 times faster on average than the current state of the art, while incurring only half the memory overhead.</p>

We build upon the recommender that has been in production since 2018, RevRecV1.We found that reviewers were being assigned based on prior authorship of files.We reviewed the literature for successful features and experimented with them with RevRecV2 in production.The most important feature in our new model was the familiarity of the author and reviewer, we saw an overall improvement in accuracy of 14 percentage points.   Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

We conduct historical analyses to understand the natural concentration of review workload and the degree of knowledge spreading that is inherent in code review.Even though review workload is highly concentrated, we show that code review natural spreads knowledge thereby reducing the files at risk to turnover.   Using simulation, we evaluate existing code review recommenders and develop novel recommenders to understand their impact on the level of expertise during review, the workload of reviewers, and the files at risk to turnover.Our simulations use seeded random replacement of reviewers to allow us to compare the reviewer recommenders without the confounding variation of different reviewers being replaced for each recommender.   Combining recommenders, we develop the SofiaWL recommender that suggests experts with low active review workload when none of the files under review are known by only one developer.In contrast, when knowledge is concentrated on one developer, it sends the review to other reviewers to spread knowledge.For the projects we study, we are able to globally increase expertise during reviews, +3%, reduce workload concentration, -12%, and reduce the files at risk, -28%.We make our scripts and data available in our replication package.Developers can optimize for a particular outcome measure based on the needs of their project, or use our GitHub bot to automatically balance the outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment is crucial for the sustained progress of open source development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the prevalence of negative discourse, often manifested as toxic comments, poses significant challenges to developer well-being and productivity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>To identify such negativity in project communications, especially within large projects, automated toxicity detection models are necessary.To train these models effectively, we need large software engineering-specific toxicity datasets.However, such datasets are limited in availability and often exhibit imbalance (e.g., only 6 in 1000 GitHub issues are toxic), posing challenges for training effective toxicity detection models.To address this problem, we explore a zero-shot LLM (ChatGPT) that is pre-trained on massive datasets but without being fine-tuned specifically for the task of detecting toxicity in software-related text.Our preliminary evaluation indicates that ChatGPT shows promise in detecting toxicity in GitHub, and warrants further investigation.We experimented with various prompts, including those designed for justifying model outputs, thereby enhancing model interpretability and paving the way for potential integration of ChatGPT-enabled toxicity detection into developer communication channels.</p>
