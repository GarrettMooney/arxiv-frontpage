                  <p>While resources for English language are fairly sufficient to understand content on social media, similar resources in Arabic are still immature.The main reason that the resources in Arabic are insufficient is that Arabic has many dialects in addition to the standard version (MSA).Arabs do not use MSA in their daily communications; rather, they use dialectal versions.Unfortunately, social users transfer this phenomenon into their use of social media platforms, which in turn has raised an urgent need for building suitable AI models for language-dependent applications.Existing machine translation (MT) systems designed for MSA fail to work well with Arabic dialects.In light of this, it is necessary to adapt to the informal nature of communication on social networks by developing MT systems that can effectively handle the various dialects of Arabic.Unlike for MSA that shows advanced progress in MT systems, little effort has been exerted to utilize Arabic dialects for MT systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While few attempts have been made to build translation datasets for dialectal Arabic, they are domain dependent and are not OSN cultural-language friendly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>In this work, we attempt to alleviate these limitations by proposing an online social network-based multidialect Arabic dataset that is crafted by contextually translating English tweets into four Arabic dialects: Gulf, Yemeni, Iraqi, and Levantine.To perform the translation, we followed our proposed guideline framework for content translation, which could be universally applicable for translation between foreign languages and local dialects.We validated the authenticity of our proposed dataset by developing neural MT models for four Arabic dialects.Our results have shown a superior performance of our NMT models trained using our dataset.We believe that our dataset can reliably serve as an Arabic multidialectal translation dataset for informal MT tasks.</p>

Particularly, {MetaMath-70B} achieves an accuracy of $82.3\%$ on {GSM8K}, slightly better than {GPT-3.5-Turbo}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the {MetaMathQA} dataset, the {MetaMath} models with different model sizes and the training code for public use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the development of deep learning, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has made significant progress.To further enhance the performance, revising recognition results is one of the lightweight but efficient manners.Various methods can be roughly classified into N-best reranking methods and error correction models.The former aims to select the hypothesis with the lowest error rate from a set of candidates generated by ASR for a given input speech.The latter focuses on detecting recognition errors in a given hypothesis and correcting these errors to obtain an enhanced result.However, we observe that these studies are hardly comparable to each other as they are usually evaluated on different corpora, paired with different ASR models, and even use different datasets to train the models.Accordingly, we first concentrate on releasing an ASR hypothesis revising (HypR) dataset in this study.HypR contains several commonly used corpora (AISHELL-1, TED-LIUM 2, and LibriSpeech) and provides 50 recognition hypotheses for each speech utterance.The checkpoint models of the ASR are also published.In addition, we implement and compare several classic and representative methods, showing the recent research progress in revising speech recognition results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope the publicly available HypR dataset can become a reference benchmark for subsequent research and promote the school of research to an advanced level. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) employ multi-view images for 3D scene representation and have shown remarkable performance.As one of the primary sources of multi-view images, multi-camera systems encounter challenges such as varying intrinsic parameters and frequent pose changes.Most previous NeRF-based methods often assume a global unique camera and seldom consider scenarios with multiple cameras.Besides, some pose-robust methods still remain susceptible to suboptimal solutions when poses are poor initialized.In this paper, we propose MC-NeRF, a method can jointly optimize both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters for bundle-adjusting Neural Radiance Fields.Firstly, we conduct a theoretical analysis to tackle the degenerate case and coupling issue that arise from the joint optimization between intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.Secondly, based on the proposed solutions, we introduce an efficient calibration image acquisition scheme for multi-camera systems, including the design of calibration object.Lastly, we present a global end-to-end network with training sequence that enables the regression of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, along with the rendering network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, most existing datasets are designed for unique camera, we create a new dataset that includes four different styles of multi-camera acquisition systems, allowing readers to generate custom datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.913</span></span>Experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method when each image corresponds to different camera parameters.Specifically, we adopt up to 110 images with 110 different intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, to achieve 3D scene representation without providing initial poses.The Code and supplementary materials are available at https://in2-viaun.github.io/MC-NeRF.</p>

                  <p>This work introduces a new multispectral database and novel approaches for eyeblink detection in RGB and Near-Infrared (NIR) individual images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our contributed dataset (mEBAL2, multimodal Eye Blink and Attention Level estimation, Version 2) is the largest existing eyeblink database, representing a great opportunity to improve data-driven multispectral approaches for blink detection and related applications (e.g., attention level estimation and presentation attack detection in face biometrics). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>mEBAL2 includes 21,100 image sequences from 180 different students (more than 2 million labeled images in total) while conducting a number of e-learning tasks of varying difficulty or taking a real course on HTML initiation through the edX MOOC platform.mEBAL2 uses multiple sensors, including two Near-Infrared (NIR) and one RGB camera to capture facial gestures during the execution of the tasks, as well as an Electroencephalogram (EEG) band to get the cognitive activity of the user and blinking events.Furthermore, this work proposes a Convolutional Neural Network architecture as benchmark for blink detection on mEBAL2 with performances up to 97%.Different training methodologies are implemented using the RGB spectrum, NIR spectrum, and the combination of both to enhance the performance on existing eyeblink detectors.We demonstrate that combining NIR and RGB images during training improves the performance of RGB eyeblink detectors (i.e., detection based only on a RGB image).Finally, the generalization capacity of the proposed eyeblink detectors is validated in wilder and more challenging environments like the HUST-LEBW dataset to show the usefulness of mEBAL2 to train a new generation of data-driven approaches for eyeblink detection.</p>

                  <p>Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) is a vital component of fields like embodied AI and virtual reality.Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI.This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands.This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions.Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.841</span></span>Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.The project page is at https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/UniHSI .</p>

                  <p>Video-based remote physiological measurement utilizes facial videos to measure the blood volume change signal, which is also called remote photoplethysmography (rPPG).Supervised methods for rPPG measurements have been shown to achieve good performance.However, the drawback of these methods is that they require facial videos with ground truth (GT) physiological signals, which are often costly and difficult to obtain.In this paper, we propose Contrast-Phys+, a method that can be trained in both unsupervised and weakly-supervised settings.We employ a 3DCNN model to generate multiple spatiotemporal rPPG signals and incorporate prior knowledge of rPPG into a contrastive loss function.We further incorporate the GT signals into contrastive learning to adapt to partial or misaligned labels.The contrastive loss encourages rPPG/GT signals from the same video to be grouped together, while pushing those from different videos apart.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our methods on five publicly available datasets that include both RGB and Near-infrared videos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>Contrast-Phys+ outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised methods, even when using partially available or misaligned GT signals, or no labels at all.Additionally, we highlight the advantages of our methods in terms of computational efficiency, noise robustness, and generalization.</p>

                  <p>Social media platforms play an essential role in crisis communication, but analyzing crisis-related social media texts is challenging due to their informal nature.Transformer-based pre-trained models like BERT and RoBERTa have shown success in various NLP tasks, but they are not tailored for crisis-related texts.Furthermore, general-purpose sentence encoders are used to generate sentence embeddings, regardless of the textual complexities in crisis-related texts.Advances in applications like text classification, semantic search, and clustering contribute to effective processing of crisis-related texts, which is essential for emergency responders to gain a comprehensive view of a crisis event, whether historical or real-time.To address these gaps in crisis informatics literature, this study introduces CrisisTransformers, an ensemble of pre-trained language models and sentence encoders trained on an extensive corpus of over 15 billion word tokens from tweets associated with more than 30 crisis events, including disease outbreaks, natural disasters, conflicts, and other critical incidents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate existing models and CrisisTransformers on 18 crisis-specific public datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span>Our pre-trained models outperform strong baselines across all datasets in classification tasks, and our best-performing sentence encoder improves the state-of-the-art by 17.43% in sentence encoding tasks.Additionally, we investigate the impact of model initialization on convergence and evaluate the significance of domain-specific models in generating semantically meaningful sentence embeddings.All models are publicly released (https://huggingface.co/crisistransformers), with the anticipation that they will serve as a robust baseline for tasks involving the analysis of crisis-related social media texts.</p>

                  <p>Relevance labels, which indicate whether a search result is valuable to a searcher, are key to evaluating and optimising search systems.The best way to capture the true preferences of users is to ask them for their careful feedback on which results would be useful, but this approach does not scale to produce a large number of labels.Getting relevance labels at scale is usually done with third-party labellers, who judge on behalf of the user, but there is a risk of low-quality data if the labeller doesn't understand user needs.To improve quality, one standard approach is to study real users through interviews, user studies and direct feedback, find areas where labels are systematically disagreeing with users, then educate labellers about user needs through judging guidelines, training and monitoring.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces an alternate approach for improving label quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>It takes careful feedback from real users, which by definition is the highest-quality first-party gold data that can be derived, and develops an large language model prompt that agrees with that data.   We present ideas and observations from deploying language models for large-scale relevance labelling at Bing, and illustrate with data from TREC.We have found large language models can be effective, with accuracy as good as human labellers and similar capability to pick the hardest queries, best runs, and best groups.Systematic changes to the prompts make a difference in accuracy, but so too do simple paraphrases.To measure agreement with real searchers needs high-quality ``gold'' labels, but with these we find that models produce better labels than third-party workers, for a fraction of the cost, and these labels let us train notably better rankers.</p>

                  <p>As a specific case of graph transfer learning, unsupervised domain adaptation on graphs aims for knowledge transfer from label-rich source graphs to unlabeled target graphs.However, graphs with topology and attributes usually have considerable cross-domain disparity and there are numerous real-world scenarios where merely a subset of nodes are labeled in the source graph.This imposes critical challenges on graph transfer learning due to serious domain shifts and label scarcity.To address these challenges, we propose a method named Semi-supervised Graph Domain Adaptation (SGDA).To deal with the domain shift, we add adaptive shift parameters to each of the source nodes, which are trained in an adversarial manner to align the cross-domain distributions of node embedding, thus the node classifier trained on labeled source nodes can be transferred to the target nodes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, to address the label scarcity, we propose pseudo-labeling on unlabeled nodes, which improves classification on the target graph via measuring the posterior influence of nodes based on their relative position to the class centroids. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Finally, extensive experiments on a range of publicly accessible datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed SGDA in different experimental settings.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural network models can learn clinically relevant features from millions of histopathology images.However generating high-quality annotations to train such models for each hospital, each cancer type, and each diagnostic task is prohibitively laborious.On the other hand, terabytes of training data -- while lacking reliable annotations -- are readily available in the public domain in some cases.In this work, we explore how these large datasets can be consciously utilized to pre-train deep networks to encode informative representations.We then fine-tune our pre-trained models on a fraction of annotated training data to perform specific downstream tasks.We show that our approach can reach the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for patch-level classification with only 1-10% randomly selected annotations compared to other SOTA approaches.Moreover, we propose an uncertainty-aware loss function, to quantify the model confidence during inference.Quantified uncertainty helps experts select the best instances to label for further training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our uncertainty-aware labeling reaches the SOTA with significantly fewer annotations compared to random labeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Last, we demonstrate how our pre-trained encoders can surpass current SOTA for whole-slide image classification with weak supervision.Our work lays the foundation for data and task-agnostic pre-trained deep networks with quantified uncertainty.</p>

                  <p>Labeling neural network submodules with human-legible descriptions is useful for many downstream tasks: such descriptions can surface failures, guide interventions, and perhaps even explain important model behaviors.To date, most mechanistic descriptions of trained networks have involved small models, narrowly delimited phenomena, and large amounts of human labor.Labeling all human-interpretable sub-computations in models of increasing size and complexity will almost certainly require tools that can generate and validate descriptions automatically.Recently, techniques that use learned models in-the-loop for labeling have begun to gain traction, but methods for evaluating their efficacy are limited and ad-hoc.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>How should we validate and compare open-ended labeling tools? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>This paper introduces FIND (Function INterpretation and Description), a benchmark suite for evaluating the building blocks of automated interpretability methods.FIND contains functions that resemble components of trained neural networks, and accompanying descriptions of the kind we seek to generate.The functions are procedurally constructed across textual and numeric domains, and involve a range of real-world complexities, including noise, composition, approximation, and bias.We evaluate new and existing methods that use language models (LMs) to produce code-based and language descriptions of function behavior.We find that an off-the-shelf LM augmented with only black-box access to functions can sometimes infer their structure, acting as a scientist by forming hypotheses, proposing experiments, and updating descriptions in light of new data.However, LM-based descriptions tend to capture global function behavior and miss local corruptions.These results show that FIND will be useful for characterizing the performance of more sophisticated interpretability methods before they are applied to real-world models.</p>
