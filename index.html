                  <p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models to the vision domain.Initial efforts towards LMMs used holistic images and text prompts to generate ungrounded textual responses.Very recently, region-level LMMs have been used to generate visually grounded responses.However, they are limited to only referring a single object category at a time, require users to specify the regions in inputs, or cannot offer dense pixel-wise object grounding.In this work, we present Grounding LMM (GLaMM), the first model that can generate natural language responses seamlessly intertwined with corresponding object segmentation masks.GLaMM not only grounds objects appearing in the conversations but is flexible enough to accept both textual and optional visual prompts (region of interest) as input.This empowers users to interact with the model at various levels of granularity, both in textual and visual domains.Due to the lack of standard benchmarks for the novel setting of generating visually grounded detailed conversations, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol with our curated grounded conversations.Our proposed Grounded Conversation Generation (GCG) task requires densely grounded concepts in natural scenes at a large-scale.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we propose a densely annotated Grounding-anything Dataset (GranD) using our proposed automated annotation pipeline that encompasses 7.5M unique concepts grounded in a total of 810M regions available with segmentation masks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>Besides GCG, GLaMM also performs effectively on several downstream tasks e.g., referring expression segmentation, image and region-level captioning and vision-language conversations.Project Page: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/groundingLMM.</p>

                  <p>Robust perception is a vital component for ensuring safe autonomous and assisted driving.Automotive radar (77 to 81 GHz), which offers weather-resilient sensing, provides a complementary capability to the vision- or LiDAR-based autonomous driving systems.Raw radio-frequency (RF) radar tensors contain rich spatiotemporal semantics besides 3D location information.The majority of previous methods take in 3D (Doppler-range-azimuth) RF radar tensors, allowing prediction of an object's location, heading angle, and size in bird's-eye-view (BEV).However, they lack the ability to at the same time infer objects' size, orientation, and identity in the 3D space.To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient joint architecture called CenterRadarNet, designed to facilitate high-resolution representation learning from 4D (Doppler-range-azimuth-elevation) radar data for 3D object detection and re-identification (re-ID) tasks.As a single-stage 3D object detector, CenterRadarNet directly infers the BEV object distribution confidence maps, corresponding 3D bounding box attributes, and appearance embedding for each pixel.Moreover, we build an online tracker utilizing the learned appearance embedding for re-ID. CenterRadarNetachieves the state-of-the-art result on the K-Radar 3D object detection benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we present the first 3D object-tracking result using radar on the K-Radar dataset V2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>In diverse driving scenarios, CenterRadarNet shows consistent, robust performance, emphasizing its wide applicability.</p>

                  <p>Intensive Care Units (ICU) provide close supervision and continuous care to patients with life-threatening conditions.However, continuous patient assessment in the ICU is still limited due to time constraints and the workload on healthcare providers.Existing patient assessments in the ICU such as pain or mobility assessment are mostly sporadic and administered manually, thus introducing the potential for human errors.Developing Artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can augment human assessments in the ICU can be beneficial for providing more objective and granular monitoring capabilities.For example, capturing the variations in a patient's facial cues related to pain or agitation can help in adjusting pain-related medications or detecting agitation-inducing conditions such as delirium.Additionally, subtle changes in visual cues during or prior to adverse clinical events could potentially aid in continuous patient monitoring when combined with high-resolution physiological signals and Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.In this paper, we examined the association between visual cues and patient condition including acuity status, acute brain dysfunction, and pain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We leveraged our AU-ICU dataset with 107,064 frames collected in the ICU annotated with facial action units (AUs) labels by trained annotators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>We developed a new "masked loss computation" technique that addresses the data imbalance problem by maximizing data resource utilization.We trained the model using our AU-ICU dataset in conjunction with three external datasets to detect 18 AUs.The SWIN Transformer model achieved 0.57 mean F1-score and 0.89 mean accuracy on the test set.Additionally, we performed AU inference on 634,054 frames to evaluate the association between facial AUs and clinically important patient conditions such as acuity status, acute brain dysfunction, and pain.</p>

                  <p>We propose a metadata-aware self-supervised learning~(SSL)~framework useful for fine-grained classification and ecological mapping of bird species around the world.Our framework unifies two SSL strategies: Contrastive Learning~(CL) and Masked Image Modeling~(MIM), while also enriching the embedding space with metadata available with ground-level imagery of birds.We separately train uni-modal and cross-modal ViT on a novel cross-view global bird species dataset containing ground-level imagery, metadata (location, time), and corresponding satellite imagery.We demonstrate that our models learn fine-grained and geographically conditioned features of birds, by evaluating on two downstream tasks: fine-grained visual classification~(FGVC) and cross-modal retrieval.Pre-trained models learned using our framework achieve SotA performance on FGVC of iNAT-2021 birds and in transfer learning settings for CUB-200-2011 and NABirds datasets.Moreover, the impressive cross-modal retrieval performance of our model enables the creation of species distribution maps across any geographic region.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and source code will be released at https://github.com/mvrl/BirdSAT}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span></p>

                  <p>Authorship Analysis, also known as stylometry, has been an essential aspect of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for a long time.Likewise, the recent advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made authorship analysis increasingly crucial for distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated texts.However, these authorship analysis tasks have primarily been focused on written texts, not considering spoken texts.Thus, we introduce the largest benchmark for spoken texts - HANSEN (Human ANd ai Spoken tExt beNchmark).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>HANSEN encompasses meticulous curation of existing speech datasets accompanied by transcripts, alongside the creation of novel AI-generated spoken text datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>Together, it comprises 17 human datasets, and AI-generated spoken texts created using 3 prominent LLMs: ChatGPT, PaLM2, and Vicuna13B. To evaluate and demonstrate the utility of HANSEN, we perform Authorship Attribution (AA) & Author Verification (AV) on human-spoken datasets and conducted Human vs. AI spoken text detection using state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.While SOTA methods, such as, character ngram or Transformer-based model, exhibit similar AA & AV performance in human-spoken datasets compared to written ones, there is much room for improvement in AI-generated spoken text detection.The HANSEN benchmark is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/HANSEN-REPO/HANSEN.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved promising zero-shot accuracy on visual question answering (VQA) -- a fundamental task affecting various downstream applications and domains.Given the great potential for the broad use of these models, it is important to investigate their limitations in dealing with different image and question properties.In this work, we investigate whether multimodal LLMs can perceive small details as well as large details in images.In particular, we show that their zero-shot accuracy in answering visual questions is very sensitive to the size of the visual subject of the question, declining up to $46\%$ with size.Furthermore, we show that this effect is causal by observing that human visual cropping can significantly mitigate their sensitivity to size.Inspired by the usefulness of human cropping, we then propose three automatic visual cropping methods as inference time mechanisms to improve the zero-shot performance of multimodal LLMs.We study their effectiveness on four popular VQA datasets, and a subset of the VQAv2 dataset tailored towards fine visual details.Our findings suggest that multimodal LLMs should be used with caution in detail-sensitive VQA applications, and that visual cropping is a promising direction to improve their zero-shot performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models with instruction-following capabilities open the door to a wider group of users.However, when it comes to information extraction - a classic task in natural language processing - most task-specific systems cannot align well with long-tail ad hoc extraction use cases for non-expert users.To address this, we propose a novel paradigm, termed On-Demand Information Extraction, to fulfill the personalized demands of real-world users.Our task aims to follow the instructions to extract the desired content from the associated text and present it in a structured tabular format.The table headers can either be user-specified or inferred contextually by the model.To facilitate research in this emerging area, we present a benchmark named InstructIE, inclusive of both automatically generated training data, as well as the human-annotated test set.Building on InstructIE, we further develop an On-Demand Information Extractor, ODIE.Comprehensive evaluations on our benchmark reveal that ODIE substantially outperforms the existing open-source models of similar size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are released on https://github.com/yzjiao/On-Demand-IE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span></p>

Our algorithm builds upon previous dynamic algorithms for approximately solving the minimum-ratio cycle problem that underlie previous advances on the maximum flow problem [Chen-Kyng-Liu-Peng-Probst Gutenberg-Sachdeva, FOCS '22] as well as recent dynamic maximum flow algorithms[v.d.Brand-Liu-Sidford, STOC '23].<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead of using interior point methods, which were a key component of these recent advances, our algorithm uses an optimization method based on $\ell_p$-norm iterative refinement and the multiplicative weight update method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>This ensures a monotonicity property in the minimum-ratio cycle subproblems that allows us to apply known data structures and bypass issues arising from adaptive queries.</p>

                  <p>In Physical Human--Robot Interaction (pHRI) grippers, humans and robots may contribute simultaneously to actions, so it is necessary to determine how to combine their commands.Control may be swapped from one to the other within certain limits, or input commands may be combined according to some criteria.The Assist-As-Needed (AAN) paradigm focuses on this second approach, as the controller is expected to provide the minimum required assistance to users.Some AAN systems rely on predicting human intention to adjust actions.However, if prediction is too hard, reactive AAN systems may weigh input commands into an emergent one.This paper proposes a novel AAN reactive control system for a robot gripper where input commands are weighted by their respective local performances.Thus, rather than minimizing tracking errors or differences to expected velocities, humans receive more help depending on their needs.The system has been tested using a gripper attached to a sensitive robot arm, which provides evaluation parameters.Tests consisted of completing an on-air planar path with both arms.After the robot gripped a person's forearm, the path and current position of the robot were displayed on a screen to provide feedback to the human.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed control has been compared to results without assistance and to impedance control for benchmarking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>A statistical analysis of the results proves that global performance improved and tracking errors decreased for ten volunteers with the proposed controller.Besides, unlike impedance control, the proposed one does not significantly affect exerted forces, command variation, or disagreement, measured as the angular difference between human and output command.Results support that the proposed control scheme fits the AAN paradigm, although future work will require further tests for more complex environments and tasks.</p>

                  <p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have recently shown impressive capability in modeling heterogeneous graphs that are ubiquitous in real-world applications.Due to the diversity of attributes of nodes in different types, most existing models first align nodes by mapping them into the same low-dimensional space.However, in this way, they lose the type information of nodes.In addition, most of them only consider the interactions between nodes while neglecting the high-order information behind the latent interactions among different node features.To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph model MULAN, including two major components, i.e., a type-aware encoder and a dimension-aware encoder.Specifically, the type-aware encoder compensates for the loss of node type information and better leverages graph heterogeneity in learning node representations.Built upon transformer architecture, the dimension-aware encoder is capable of capturing the latent interactions among the diverse node features.With these components, the information of graph heterogeneity, node features and graph structure can be comprehensively encoded in node representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on six heterogeneous benchmark datasets, which demonstrates the superiority of MULAN over other state-of-the-art competitors and also shows that MULAN is efficient. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we highlight a problem of evaluation metrics adopted in the open-vocabulary segmentation.That is, the evaluation process still heavily relies on closed-set metrics on zero-shot or cross-dataset pipelines without considering the similarity between predicted and ground truth categories.To tackle this issue, we first survey eleven similarity measurements between two categorical words using WordNet linguistics statistics, text embedding, and language models by comprehensive quantitative analysis and user study.Built upon those explored measurements, we designed novel evaluation metrics, namely Open mIoU, Open AP, and Open PQ, tailored for three open-vocabulary segmentation tasks.We benchmarked the proposed evaluation metrics on 12 open-vocabulary methods of three segmentation tasks.Even though the relative subjectivity of similarity distance, we demonstrate that our metrics can still well evaluate the open ability of the existing open-vocabulary segmentation methods.We hope that our work can bring with the community new thinking about how to evaluate the open ability of models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation code is released in github. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision transformers have gained significant attention and achieved state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, instance segmentation, and object detection.However, challenges remain in addressing attention complexity and effectively capturing fine-grained information within images.Existing solutions often resort to down-sampling operations, such as pooling, to reduce computational cost.Unfortunately, such operations are non-invertible and can result in information loss.In this paper, we present a novel approach called Scattering Vision Transformer (SVT) to tackle these challenges.SVT incorporates a spectrally scattering network that enables the capture of intricate image details.SVT overcomes the invertibility issue associated with down-sampling operations by separating low-frequency and high-frequency components.Furthermore, SVT introduces a unique spectral gating network utilizing Einstein multiplication for token and channel mixing, effectively reducing complexity.We show that SVT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset with a significant reduction in a number of parameters and FLOPS.SVT shows 2\% improvement over LiTv2 and iFormer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SVT-H-S reaches 84.2\% top-1 accuracy, while SVT-H-B reaches 85.2\% (state-of-art for base versions) and SVT-H-L reaches 85.7\% (again state-of-art for large versions). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>SVT also shows comparable results in other vision tasks such as instance segmentation.SVT also outperforms other transformers in transfer learning on standard datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Oxford Flower, and Stanford Car datasets.The project page is available on this webpage.\url{https://badripatro.github.io/svt/}.</p>

                  <p>In real-world scenarios, arbitrary interactions with the environment can often be costly, and actions of expert demonstrations are not always available.To reduce the need for both, Offline Learning from Observations (LfO) is extensively studied, where the agent learns to solve a task with only expert states and \textit{task-agnostic} non-expert state-action pairs.The state-of-the-art DIstribution Correction Estimation (DICE) methods minimize the state occupancy divergence between the learner and expert policies.However, they are limited to either $f$-divergences (KL and $\chi^2$) or Wasserstein distance with Rubinstein duality, the latter of which constrains the underlying distance metric crucial to the performance of Wasserstein-based solutions.To address this problem, we propose Primal Wasserstein DICE (PW-DICE), which minimizes the primal Wasserstein distance between the expert and learner state occupancies with a pessimistic regularizer and leverages a contrastively learned distance as the underlying metric for the Wasserstein distance.Theoretically, we prove that our framework is a generalization of the state-of-the-art, SMODICE, and unifies $f$-divergence and Wasserstein minimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirically, we find that PW-DICE improves upon several state-of-the-art methods on multiple testbeds. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper introduces a novel methodology for simulating the dynamics of beams on elastic foundations.Specifically, Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam models on the Winkler foundation are simulated using a transfer learning approach within a causality-respecting physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework.Conventional PINNs encounter challenges in handling large space-time domains, even for problems with closed-form analytical solutions.A causality-respecting PINN loss function is employed to overcome this limitation, effectively capturing the underlying physics.However, it is observed that the causality-respecting PINN lacks generalizability.We propose using solutions to similar problems instead of training from scratch by employing transfer learning while adhering to causality to accelerate convergence and ensure accurate results across diverse scenarios.Numerical experiments on the Euler-Bernoulli beam highlight the efficacy of the proposed approach for various initial conditions, including those with noise in the initial data.Furthermore, the potential of the proposed method is demonstrated for the Timoshenko beam in an extended spatial and temporal domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Several comparisons suggest that the proposed method accurately captures the inherent dynamics, outperforming the state-of-the-art physics-informed methods under standard $L^2$-norm metric and accelerating convergence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>The core components of many modern neural network architectures, such as transformers, convolutional, or graph neural networks, can be expressed as linear layers with $\textit{weight-sharing}$. Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC), a second-order optimisation method, has shown promise to speed up neural network training and thereby reduce computational costs.However, there is currently no framework to apply it to generic architectures, specifically ones with linear weight-sharing layers.In this work, we identify two different settings of linear weight-sharing layers which motivate two flavours of K-FAC -- $\textit{expand}$ and $\textit{reduce}$. We show that they are exact for deep linear networks with weight-sharing in their respective setting.Notably, K-FAC-reduce is generally faster than K-FAC-expand, which we leverage to speed up automatic hyperparameter selection via optimising the marginal likelihood for a Wide ResNet.Finally, we observe little difference between these two K-FAC variations when using them to train both a graph neural network and a vision transformer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, both variations are able to reach a fixed validation metric target in $50$-$75\%$ of the number of steps of a first-order reference run, which translates into a comparable improvement in wall-clock time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>This highlights the potential of applying K-FAC to modern neural network architectures.</p>

First, we show numerically that several practical variants such as simultaneous RM$^+$, alternating RM$^+$, and simultaneous predictive RM$^+$, all lack last-iterate convergence guarantees even on a simple $3\times 3$ game.We then prove that recent variants of these algorithms based on a smoothing technique do enjoy last-iterate convergence: we prove that extragradient RM$^{+}$ and smooth Predictive RM$^+$ enjoy asymptotic last-iterate convergence (without a rate) and $1/\sqrt{t}$ best-iterate convergence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we introduce restarted variants of these algorithms, and show that they enjoy linear-rate last-iterate convergence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the constrained planarity setting, we ask whether a graph admits a planar drawing that additionally satisfies a given set of constraints.These constraints are often derived from very natural problems; prominent examples are Level Planarity, where vertices have to lie on given horizontal lines indicating a hierarchy, and Clustered Planarity, where we additionally draw the boundaries of clusters which recursively group the vertices in a crossing-free manner.Despite receiving significant amount of attention and substantial theoretical progress on these problems, only very few of the found solutions have been put into practice and evaluated experimentally.   In this paper, we describe our implementation of the recent quadratic-time algorithm by Bl\"asius et al.[TALG Vol 19, No 4] for solving the problem Synchronized Planarity, which can be seen as a common generalization of several constrained planarity problems, including the aforementioned ones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental evaluation on an existing benchmark set shows that even our baseline implementation outperforms all competitors by at least an order of magnitude. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>We systematically investigate the degrees of freedom in the implementation of the Synchronized Planarity algorithm for larger instances and propose several modifications that further improve the performance.Altogether, this allows us to solve instances with up to 100 vertices in milliseconds and instances with up to 100 000 vertices within a few minutes.</p>

                  <p>Person search (PS) is a challenging computer vision problem where the objective is to achieve joint optimization for pedestrian detection and re-identification (ReID).Although previous advancements have shown promising performance in the field under fully and weakly supervised learning fashion, there exists a major gap in investigating the domain adaptation ability of PS models.In this paper, we propose a diligent domain adaptive mixer (DDAM) for person search (DDAP-PS) framework that aims to bridge a gap to improve knowledge transfer from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain.Specifically, we introduce a novel DDAM module that generates moderate mixed-domain representations by combining source and target domain representations.The proposed DDAM module encourages domain mixing to minimize the distance between the two extreme domains, thereby enhancing the ReID task.To achieve this, we introduce two bridge losses and a disparity loss.The objective of the two bridge losses is to guide the moderate mixed-domain representations to maintain an appropriate distance from both the source and target domain representations.The disparity loss aims to prevent the moderate mixed-domain representations from being biased towards either the source or target domains, thereby avoiding overfitting.Furthermore, we address the conflict between the two subtasks, localization and ReID, during domain adaptation.To handle this cross-task conflict, we forcefully decouple the norm-aware embedding, which aids in better learning of the moderate mixed-domain representation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>Our approach demonstrates favorable performance on the challenging PRW and CUHK-SYSU datasets.Our source code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/mustansarfiaz/DDAM-PS}.</p>

                  <p>A remarkable ability of human beings resides in compositional reasoning, i.e., the capacity to make "infinite use of finite means".However, current large vision-language foundation models (VLMs) fall short of such compositional abilities due to their "bag-of-words" behaviors and inability to construct words that correctly represent visual entities and the relations among the entities.To this end, we propose CoVLM, which can guide the LLM to explicitly compose visual entities and relationships among the text and dynamically communicate with the vision encoder and detection network to achieve vision-language communicative decoding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we first devise a set of novel communication tokens for the LLM, for dynamic communication between the visual detection system and the language system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A communication token is generated by the LLM following a visual entity or a relation, to inform the detection network to propose regions that are relevant to the sentence generated so far. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed regions-of-interests (ROIs) are then fed back into the LLM for better language generation contingent on the relevant regions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM is thus able to compose the visual entities and relationships through the communication tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span>The vision-to-language and language-to-vision communication are iteratively performed until the entire sentence is generated.Our framework seamlessly bridges the gap between visual perception and LLMs and outperforms previous VLMs by a large margin on compositional reasoning benchmarks (e.g., ~20% in HICO-DET mAP, ~14% in Cola top-1 accuracy, and ~3% on ARO top-1 accuracy).We also achieve state-of-the-art performances on traditional vision-language tasks such as referring expression comprehension and visual question answering.</p>

                  <p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models to the vision domain.Initial efforts towards LMMs used holistic images and text prompts to generate ungrounded textual responses.Very recently, region-level LMMs have been used to generate visually grounded responses.However, they are limited to only referring a single object category at a time, require users to specify the regions in inputs, or cannot offer dense pixel-wise object grounding.In this work, we present Grounding LMM (GLaMM), the first model that can generate natural language responses seamlessly intertwined with corresponding object segmentation masks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>GLaMM not only grounds objects appearing in the conversations but is flexible enough to accept both textual and optional visual prompts (region of interest) as input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>This empowers users to interact with the model at various levels of granularity, both in textual and visual domains.Due to the lack of standard benchmarks for the novel setting of generating visually grounded detailed conversations, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol with our curated grounded conversations.Our proposed Grounded Conversation Generation (GCG) task requires densely grounded concepts in natural scenes at a large-scale.To this end, we propose a densely annotated Grounding-anything Dataset (GranD) using our proposed automated annotation pipeline that encompasses 7.5M unique concepts grounded in a total of 810M regions available with segmentation masks.Besides GCG, GLaMM also performs effectively on several downstream tasks e.g., referring expression segmentation, image and region-level captioning and vision-language conversations.Project Page: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/groundingLMM.</p>

This paper proposes an automatic approach using the BART algorithm, a state-of-the-art transformer model, to generate summaries for APIs discussed in StackOverflow.We built an oracle of human-generated summaries to evaluate our approach against it using ROUGE and BLEU metrics which are the most widely used evaluation metrics in text summarization.Furthermore, we evaluated our summaries empirically against a previous work in terms of quality.Our findings demonstrate that using deep learning algorithms can improve summaries' quality and outperform the previous work by an average of %57 for Precision, %66 for Recall, and %61 for F-measure, and it runs 4.4 times faster.</p>
