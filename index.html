                  <p>CONTEXT The R programming language has a huge and active community, especially in the area of statistical computing.Its interpreted nature allows for several interesting constructs, like the manipulation of functions at run-time, that hinder the static analysis of R programs.At the same time, there is a lack of existing research regarding how these features, or even the R language as a whole are used in practice.OBJECTIVEIn this paper, we conduct a large-scale, static analysis of more than 50 million lines of real-world R programs and packages to identify their characteristics and the features that are actually used.Moreover, we compare the similarities and differences between the scripts of R users and the implementations of package authors.We provide insights for static analysis tools like the lintr package as well as potential interpreter optimizations and uncover areas for future research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>METHOD We analyze 4230 R scripts submitted alongside publications and the sources of 19450 CRAN packages for over 350000 R files, collecting and summarizing quantitative information for features of interest. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.869</span></span>RESULTS We find a high frequency of name-based indexing operations, assignments, and loops, but a low frequency for most of R's reflective functions.Furthermore, we find neither testing functions nor many calls to R's foreign function interface (FFI) in the publication submissions.CONCLUSION R scripts and package sources differ, for example, in their size, the way they include other packages, and their usage of R's reflective capabilities.We provide features that are used frequently and should be prioritized by static analysis tools, like operator assignments, function calls, and certain reflective functions like load.</p>

                  <p>Roadside unit (RSU) can significantly improve the safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication.Currently, the usage of a single RSU mainly focuses on real-time inference and V2X collaboration, while neglecting the potential value of the high-quality data collected by RSU sensors.Integrating the vast amounts of data from numerous RSUs can provide a rich source of data for model training.However, the absence of ground truth annotations and the difficulty of transmitting enormous volumes of data are two inevitable barriers to fully exploiting this hidden value.In this paper, we introduce FedRSU, an innovative federated learning framework for self-supervised scene flow estimation.In FedRSU, we present a recurrent self-supervision training paradigm, where for each RSU, the scene flow prediction of points at every timestamp can be supervised by its subsequent future multi-modality observation.Another key component of FedRSU is federated learning, where multiple devices collaboratively train an ML model while keeping the training data local and private.With the power of the recurrent self-supervised learning paradigm, FL is able to leverage innumerable underutilized data from RSU.To verify the FedRSU framework, we construct a large-scale multi-modality dataset RSU-SF.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset consists of 17 RSU clients, covering various scenarios, modalities, and sensor settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span>Based on RSU-SF, we show that FedRSU can greatly improve model performance in ITS and provide a comprehensive benchmark under diverse FL scenarios.To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first real-world LiDAR-camera multi-modal dataset and benchmark for the FL community.</p>

Additionally, we simply apply red teaming alignment to LLaVA-v1.5 with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) using RTVLM, and this bolsters the models' performance with 10% in RTVLM test set, 13% in MM-Hal, and without noticeable decline in MM-Bench, overpassing other LLaVA-based models with regular alignment data.This reveals that current open-sourced VLMs still lack red teaming alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets will be open-source. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Pain assessment in individuals with neurological conditions, especially those with limited self-report ability and altered facial expressions, presents challenges.Existing measures, relying on direct observation by caregivers, lack sensitivity and specificity.In cerebral palsy, pain is a common comorbidity and a reliable evaluation protocol is crucial.Thus, having an automatic system that recognizes facial expressions could be of enormous help when diagnosing pain in this type of patient.   Objectives: 1) to build a dataset of facial pain expressions in individuals with cerebral palsy, and 2) to develop an automated facial recognition system based on deep learning for pain assessment addressed to this population.   Methods: Ten neural networks were trained on three pain image databases, including the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database, the Multimodal Intensity Pain Dataset, and the Delaware Pain Database.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, a curated dataset (CPPAIN) was created, consisting of 109 preprocessed facial pain expression images from individuals with cerebral palsy, categorized by two physiotherapists using the Facial Action Coding System observational scale.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>Results: InceptionV3 exhibited promising performance on the CP-PAIN dataset, achieving an accuracy of 62.67% and an F1 score of 61.12%.Explainable artificial intelligence techniques revealed consistent essential features for pain identification across models.   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models for robust pain detection in populations with neurological conditions and communication disabilities.The creation of a larger dataset specific to cerebral palsy would further enhance model accuracy, offering a valuable tool for discerning subtle and idiosyncratic pain expressions.The insights gained could extend to other complex neurological conditions.</p>

                  <p>Understanding and reasoning about spatial relationships is a fundamental capability for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and robotics.While Vision Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated remarkable performance in certain VQA benchmarks, they still lack capabilities in 3D spatial reasoning, such as recognizing quantitative relationships of physical objects like distances or size differences.We hypothesize that VLMs' limited spatial reasoning capability is due to the lack of 3D spatial knowledge in training data and aim to solve this problem by training VLMs with Internet-scale spatial reasoning data.To this end, we present a system to facilitate this approach.We first develop an automatic 3D spatial VQA data generation framework that scales up to 2 billion VQA examples on 10 million real-world images.We then investigate various factors in the training recipe, including data quality, training pipeline, and VLM architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work features the first internet-scale 3D spatial reasoning dataset in metric space. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>By training a VLM on such data, we significantly enhance its ability on both qualitative and quantitative spatial VQA.Finally, we demonstrate that this VLM unlocks novel downstream applications in chain-of-thought spatial reasoning and robotics due to its quantitative estimation capability.Project website: https://spatial-vlm.github.io/</p>

                  <p>3D vision-language grounding, which focuses on aligning language with the 3D physical environment, stands as a cornerstone in the development of embodied agents.In comparison to recent advancements in the 2D domain, grounding language in 3D scenes faces several significant challenges: (i) the inherent complexity of 3D scenes due to the diverse object configurations, their rich attributes, and intricate relationships; (ii) the scarcity of paired 3D vision-language data to support grounded learning; and (iii) the absence of a unified learning framework to distill knowledge from grounded 3D data.In this work, we aim to address these three major challenges in 3D vision-language by examining the potential of systematically upscaling 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse, encompassing about 68K 3D indoor scenes and comprising 2.5M vision-language pairs derived from both human annotations and our scalable scene-graph-based generation approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.917</span></span>We demonstrate that this scaling allows for a unified pre-training framework, Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), for 3D vision-language learning.Through extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of GPS by achieving state-of-the-art performance on all existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks.The vast potential of SceneVerse and GPS is unveiled through zero-shot transfer experiments in the challenging 3D vision-language tasks.Project website: https://scene-verse.github.io .</p>

This process was guided by our ontology and involved a thorough automatic and manual filtering process, yielding a set of 216 maths problems.We conducted comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs on MORE.The results show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions.This strongly suggests that current LLMs lack robust mathematical skills and deep reasoning abilities.This research not only identifies multiple gaps in the capabilities of current models, but also highlights multiple potential directions for future development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset will be made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/GSM8k_MORE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span></p>

                  <p>Integrating deep learning and causal discovery has encouraged us to spot that learning causal structures and representations in dialogue and video is full of challenges.We defined These data forms as "Indefinite Data", characterized by multi-structure data and multi-value representations.Unlike existing adaptable data forms, Indefinite Data still faces gaps in datasets and methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the dataset gap, we release two high-quality datasets - Causalogue and Causaction, containing text dialogue samples and video action samples with causal annotations respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>Moreover, the method gap arises from the coexistence of multi-structure data and multi-value representations, breaking the assumptions of all current methods and rendering them infeasible on Indefinite Data.To this end, we propose a probabilistic framework as a baseline, incorporating three designed highlights for this gap: 1) establishing Causation Condition of representations using the independence of noise terms under non-fixed causal structures, 2) treating causal strength as a latent variable and measuring the reconstruction loss in the correlation space, and 3) estimating the effects of latent confounders.These highpoints make the probabilistic model capable of overcoming challenges brought by the coexistence of multi-structure data and multi-value representations and pave the way for the extension of latent confounders.Comprehensive experiments have evaluated baseline results of causal structures, causal representations, and confounding disentanglement.</p>

                  <p>The evolution of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been significantly influenced by six core challenges (Koehn and Knowles, 2017), which have acted as benchmarks for progress in this field.This study revisits these challenges, offering insights into their ongoing relevance in the context of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): domain mismatch, amount of parallel data, rare word prediction, translation of long sentences, attention model as word alignment, and sub-optimal beam search.Our empirical findings indicate that LLMs effectively lessen the reliance on parallel data for major languages in the pretraining phase.Additionally, the LLM-based translation system significantly enhances the translation of long sentences that contain approximately 80 words and shows the capability to translate documents of up to 512 words.However, despite these significant improvements, the challenges of domain mismatch and prediction of rare words persist.While the challenges of word alignment and beam search, specifically associated with NMT, may not apply to LLMs, we identify three new challenges for LLMs in translation tasks: inference efficiency, translation of low-resource languages in the pretraining phase, and human-aligned evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets and models are released at https://github.com/pangjh3/LLM4MT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span></p>

                  <p>Without human annotations, a typical Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection (UVAD) method needs to train two models that generate pseudo labels for each other.In previous work, the two models are closely entangled with each other, and it is not known how to upgrade their method without modifying their training framework significantly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, previous work usually adopts fixed thresholding to obtain pseudo labels, however the user-specified threshold is not reliable which inevitably introduces errors into the training process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>To alleviate these two problems, we propose a novel interleaved framework that alternately trains a One-Class Classification (OCC) model and a Weakly-Supervised (WS) model for UVAD.The OCC or WS models in our method can be easily replaced with other OCC or WS models, which facilitates our method to upgrade with the most recent developments in both fields.For handling the fixed thresholding problem, we break through the conventional cognitive boundary and propose a weighted OCC model that can be trained on both normal and abnormal data.We also propose an adaptive mechanism for automatically finding the optimal threshold for the WS model in a loose to strict manner.Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UVAD method outperforms previous approaches.</p>

                  <p>Configuring the hybrid precoders and combiners in a millimeter wave (mmWave) multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is challenging in frequency selective channels.In this paper, we develop a system that uses compressive estimation on the uplink to configure precoders and combiners for the downlink (DL).In the first step, the base station (BS) simultaneously estimates the channels from all the mobile stations (MSs) on each subcarrier.To reduce the number of measurements required, compressed sensing techniques are developed that exploit common support on the different subcarriers.In the second step, exploiting reciprocity and the channel estimates, the base station designs hybrid precoders and combiners.Two algorithms are developed for this purpose, with different performance and complexity tradeoffs: 1) a factorization of the purely digital solution, and 2) an iterative hybrid design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive numerical experiments evaluate the proposed solutions comparing to state-of-the-art strategies, and illustrating design tradeoffs in overhead, complexity, and performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique that aligns language models closely with human-centric values.The initial phase of RLHF involves learning human values using a reward model from ranking data.It is observed that the performance of the reward model degrades after one epoch of training, and optimizing too much against the learned reward model eventually hinders the true objective.This paper delves into these issues, leveraging the theoretical insights to design improved reward learning algorithm termed 'Iterative Data Smoothing' (IDS).The core idea is that during each training epoch, we not only update the model with the data, but also update the date using the model, replacing hard labels with soft labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical findings highlight the superior performance of this approach over the traditional methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are difficult to fully fine-tune (e.g., with instructions or human feedback) due to their sheer number of parameters.A family of parameter-efficient sparse fine-tuning (SFT) methods have proven promising in terms of performance but their memory requirements increase proportionally to the size of the LLMs.In this work, we scale sparse fine-tuning to state-of-the-art LLMs like LLaMA 2 7B and 13B. At any given time, for a desired density level, we maintain an array of parameter indices and the deltas of these parameters relative to their pretrained values.We iterate among: (a) updating the active deltas, (b) pruning indices (based on the change of magnitude of their deltas) and (c) regrowth of indices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For regrowth, we explore two criteria based on either the accumulated gradients of a few candidate parameters or their approximate momenta estimated using the efficient SM3 optimizer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>We experiment with instruction-tuning of LLMs on standard dataset mixtures, finding that SFT is often superior to popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA (low-rank adaptation) in terms of performance and comparable in terms of run time.We additionally show that SFT is compatible with both quantization and efficient optimizers, to facilitate scaling to ever-larger model sizes.We release the code for SFT at https://github.com/AlanAnsell/peft and for the instruction-tuning experiments at https://github.com/ducdauge/sft-llm.</p>

                  <p>Improving sample efficiency is central to Reinforcement Learning (RL), especially in environments where the rewards are sparse.Some recent approaches have proposed to specify reward functions as manually designed or learned reward structures whose integrations in the RL algorithms are claimed to significantly improve the learning efficiency.Manually designed reward structures can suffer from inaccuracy and existing automatically learning methods are often computationally intractable for complex tasks.The integration of inaccurate or partial reward structures in RL algorithms fail to learn optimal policies.In this work, we propose an RL algorithm that can automatically structure the reward function for sample efficiency, given a set of labels that signify subtasks.Given such minimal knowledge about the task, we train a high-level policy that selects optimal sub-tasks in each state together with a low-level policy that efficiently learns to complete each sub-task.We evaluate our algorithm in a variety of sparse-reward environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiment results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-art baselines as the difficulty of the task increases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present an approach for the data-driven modeling of nonlinear viscoelastic materials at small strains which is based on physics-augmented neural networks (NNs) and requires only stress and strain paths for training.The model is built on the concept of generalized standard materials and is therefore thermodynamically consistent by construction.It consists of a free energy and a dissipation potential, which can be either expressed by the components of their tensor arguments or by a suitable set of invariants.The two potentials are described by fully/partially input convex neural networks.For training of the NN model by paths of stress and strain, an efficient and flexible training method based on a recurrent cell, particularly a long short-term memory cell, is developed to automatically generate the internal variable(s) during the training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method is benchmarked and thoroughly compared with existing approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span>These include a method that obtains the internal variable by integrating the evolution equation over the entire sequence, while the other method uses an an auxiliary feedforward neural network for the internal variable(s).Databases for training are generated by using a conventional nonlinear viscoelastic reference model, where 3D and 2D plane strain data with either ideal or noisy stresses are generated.The coordinate-based and the invariant-based formulation are compared and the advantages of the latter are demonstrated.Afterwards, the invariant-based model is calibrated by applying the three training methods using ideal or noisy stress data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All methods yield good results, but differ in computation time and usability for large data sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>The presented training method based on a recurrent cell turns out to be particularly robust and widely applicable and thus represents a promising approach for the calibration of other types of models as well.</p>

                  <p>Blockchain performance has historically faced challenges posed by the throughput limitations of consensus algorithms.Recent breakthroughs in research have successfully alleviated these constraints by introducing a modular architecture that decouples consensus from execution.The move toward independent optimization of the consensus layer has shifted attention to the execution layer.   While concurrent transaction execution is a promising solution for increasing throughput, practical challenges persist.Its effectiveness varies based on the workloads, and the associated increased hardware requirements raise concerns about undesirable centralization.This increased requirement results in full nodes and stragglers synchronizing from signed checkpoints, decreasing the trustless nature of blockchain systems.   In response to these challenges, this paper introduces Chiron, a system designed to extract execution hints for the acceleration of straggling and full nodes.Notably, Chiron achieves this without compromising the security of the system or introducing overhead on the critical path of consensus.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation results demonstrate a notable speedup of up to 30%, effectively addressing the gap between theoretical research and practical deployment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The quantification of this speedup is achieved through realistic blockchain benchmarks derived from a comprehensive analysis of Ethereum and Solana workloads, constituting an independent contribution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span></p>

In this paper, we give a randomized algorithm that finds a set $B\subseteq [n]$ subject to any matroid constraint whose minimum eigenvalue is at least $(1-\epsilon)$ times the optimum, with high probability.The running time of the algorithm is $O\left( n^{O(d\log(d)/\epsilon^2)}\right)$. In particular, our results give a polynomial time asymptotic scheme when the dimension of the vectors is constant.Our algorithm uses a convex programming relaxation of the problem after guessing a rescaling which allows us to apply pipage rounding and matrix Chernoff inequalities to round to a good solution.The key new component is a structural lemma which enables us to "guess'' the appropriate rescaling, which could be of independent interest.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach generalizes the approximation guarantee to monotone, homogeneous functions and as such we can maximize $\det(\sum_{i\in B} v_i v_i^\top)^{1/d}$, or minimize any norm of the eigenvalues of the matrix $\left(\sum_{i\in B} v_i v_i^\top\right)^{-1} $, with the same running time under some mild assumptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>As a byproduct, we also get a simple algorithm for an algorithmic version of Kadison-Singer problem.</p>

                  <p>We devise a parameterized family of distributions, the high-entropy step distributions (HES), which are expressive enough to capture near-optima of spherical spin glass models in the full Replica Symmetry Breaking (fRSB) regime and yet permit low-degree Sum-of-Squares (SoS) certificates that no such distribution can achieve value slightly larger than the true optimum.This yields a SoS optimization program and rounding scheme that attains near-optimal solutions for spherical spin glasses in the fRSB regime.In other regimes, the same results occur at the ALG value, which is a conjectured best-value attainable by any polynomial time algorithm.These SoS programs optimize over families of distributions of possible solutions, and circumvent the oft-cited impossibility of providing a low-degree SoS proof of concentration of measure by instead proving the same bounds only in expectation on solution distributions that can be produced by the chosen rounding algorithm.The new SoS hierarchy does not make any specific reference to the spherical spin glass problem, and we conjecture that it can be applied to a broad range of average-case problems to obtain value that is optimal among polynomial-time algorithms.We give evidence for this with examples of ensembles that provably fool certain local iterative algorithms but for which there is either proof or evidence that the SoS program is better.This opens the door to addressing a question posed by Barak about the possible optimality of SoS on average-case optimization problems, and by Schramm about reductions between different families of algorithms for average-case problems.In this paper, we give low-degree SoS proofs certifying key properties about HES distributions as well as the ALG threshold for spherical spin glasses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The rounding algorithm is introduced and analyzed in a companion paper. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span></p>

                  <p>Without human annotations, a typical Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection (UVAD) method needs to train two models that generate pseudo labels for each other.In previous work, the two models are closely entangled with each other, and it is not known how to upgrade their method without modifying their training framework significantly.Second, previous work usually adopts fixed thresholding to obtain pseudo labels, however the user-specified threshold is not reliable which inevitably introduces errors into the training process.To alleviate these two problems, we propose a novel interleaved framework that alternately trains a One-Class Classification (OCC) model and a Weakly-Supervised (WS) model for UVAD.The OCC or WS models in our method can be easily replaced with other OCC or WS models, which facilitates our method to upgrade with the most recent developments in both fields.For handling the fixed thresholding problem, we break through the conventional cognitive boundary and propose a weighted OCC model that can be trained on both normal and abnormal data.We also propose an adaptive mechanism for automatically finding the optimal threshold for the WS model in a loose to strict manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UVAD method outperforms previous approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>Entity alignment (EA), a pivotal process in integrating multi-source Knowledge Graphs (KGs), seeks to identify equivalent entity pairs across these graphs.Most existing approaches regard EA as a graph representation learning task, concentrating on enhancing graph encoders.However, the decoding process in EA - essential for effective operation and alignment accuracy - has received limited attention and remains tailored to specific datasets and model architectures, necessitating both entity and additional explicit relation embeddings.This specificity limits its applicability, particularly in GNN-based models.To address this gap, we introduce a novel, generalized, and efficient decoding approach for EA, relying solely on entity embeddings.Our method optimizes the decoding process by minimizing Dirichlet energy, leading to the gradient flow within the graph, to promote graph homophily.The discretization of the gradient flow produces a fast and scalable approach, termed Triple Feature Propagation (TFP).TFP innovatively channels gradient flow through three views: entity-to-entity, entity-to-relation, and relation-to-entity.This generalized gradient flow enables TFP to harness the multi-view structural information of KGs.Rigorous experimentation on diverse real-world datasets demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances various EA methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, the approach achieves these advancements with less than 6 seconds of additional computational time, establishing a new benchmark in efficiency and adaptability for future EA methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span></p>

                  <p>When selecting data for training large-scale models, standard practice is to filter for examples that match human notions of data quality.Such filtering yields qualitatively clean datapoints that intuitively should improve model behavior.However, in practice the opposite can often happen: we find that selecting according to similarity with "high quality" data sources may not increase (and can even hurt) performance compared to randomly selecting data.   To develop better methods for selecting data, we start by framing dataset selection as an optimization problem that we can directly solve for: given target tasks, a learning algorithm, and candidate data, select the subset that maximizes model performance.This framework thus avoids handpicked notions of data quality, and instead models explicitly how the learning process uses train datapoints to predict on the target tasks.Our resulting method greatly improves language model (LM) performance on both pre-specified tasks and previously unseen tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, choosing target tasks representative of standard LM problems and evaluating on diverse held-out benchmarks, our selected datasets provide a 2x compute multiplier over baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>Pilotfish is the first scale-out blockchain execution engine able to harness any degree of parallelizability existing in its workload.Pilotfish allows each validator to employ multiple machines, named ExecutionWorkers, under its control to scale its execution layer.Given a sufficiently parallelizable and compute-intensive load, the number of transactions that the validator can execute increases linearly with the number of ExecutionWorkers at its disposal.   In addition, Pilotfish maintains the consistency of the state, even when many validators experience simultaneous machine failures.This is possible due to the meticulous co-design of our crash-recovery protocol which leverages the existing fault tolerance in the blockchain's consensus mechanism.   Finally, Pilotfish can also be seen as the first distributed deterministic execution engine that provides support for dynamic reads as transactions are not required to provide a fully accurate read and write set.This loosening of requirements would normally reduce the parallelizability available by blocking write-after-write conflicts, but our novel versioned-queues scheduling algorithm circumvents this by exploiting the lazy recovery property of Pilotfish, which only persists consistent state and re-executes any optimistic steps taken before the crash.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In order to prove our claims we implemented the common path of Pilotfish with support for the MoveVM and evaluated it against the parallel execution MoveVM of Sui. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Our results show that our simpler scheduling algorithms outperforms Sui even with a single execution worker, but more importantly provides linear scalability up to 4 ExecutionWorkers even for simple asset-transfers and to any number of ExecutionWorkers for more computationally heavy workloads.</p>

In this study, we analyze DevGPT, a dataset of more than 4,000 Developer-ChatGPT interactions, to understand the role of library versions in code-related conversations.We quantify how often library version constraints are mentioned in code-related conversations and when ChatGPT recommends the installation of specific libraries.Our findings show that, albeit to constantly recommend and analyze code with external dependencies, library version constraints only appear in 9% of the conversations.In the majority of conversations, the version constraints are prompted by users (as opposed to being specified by ChatGPT) as a method for receiving better quality responses.Moreover, we study how library version constraints are used in the conversation through qualitative methods, identifying several potential problems that warrant further research.</p>

Compared with SnR, ZS4C improves the compilation rate from 63% to 87.6%, with a 39.3% improvement.On average, ZS4C can infer more accurate import statements than SnR, with an improvement of 6.6% in the F1.</p>

                  <p>Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Engineers are responsible for assessing a product during every phase of the software development process to ensure that the outcomes of each phase and the final product possess the desired qualities.In general, a great SQA engineer needs to have a different set of abilities from development engineers to effectively oversee the entire product development process from beginning to end.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent empirical studies identified important attributes of software engineers and managers, but the quality assurance role is overlooked. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>As software quality aspects have become more of a priority in the life cycle of software development, employers seek professionals that best suit the company's objectives and new graduates desire to make a valuable contribution through their job as an SQA engineer, but what makes them great?We addressed this knowledge gap by conducting 25 semi-structured interviews and 363 survey respondents with software quality assurance engineers from different companies around the world.We use the data collected from these activities to derive a comprehensive set of attributes that are considered important.As a result of the interviews, twenty-five attributes were identified and grouped into five main categories: personal, social, technical, management, and decision-making attributes.Through a rating survey, we confirmed that the distinguishing characteristics of great SQA engineers are curiosity, the ability to communicate effectively, and critical thinking skills.This work will guide further studies with SQA practitioners, by considering contextual factors and providing some implications for research and practice.</p>
