                  <p>Accurate depth estimation under out-of-distribution (OoD) scenarios, such as adverse weather conditions, sensor failure, and noise contamination, is desirable for safety-critical applications.Existing depth estimation systems, however, suffer inevitably from real-world corruptions and perturbations and are struggled to provide reliable depth predictions under such cases.In this paper, we summarize the winning solutions from the RoboDepth Challenge -- an academic competition designed to facilitate and advance robust OoD depth estimation.This challenge was developed based on the newly established KITTI-C and NYUDepth2-C benchmarks.We hosted two stand-alone tracks, with an emphasis on robust self-supervised and robust fully-supervised depth estimation, respectively.Out of more than two hundred participants, nine unique and top-performing solutions have appeared, with novel designs ranging from the following aspects: spatial- and frequency-domain augmentations, masked image modeling, image restoration and super-resolution, adversarial training, diffusion-based noise suppression, vision-language pre-training, learned model ensembling, and hierarchical feature enhancement.Extensive experimental analyses along with insightful observations are drawn to better understand the rationale behind each design.We hope this challenge could lay a solid foundation for future research on robust and reliable depth estimation and beyond.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets, competition toolkit, workshop recordings, and source code from the winning teams are publicly available on the challenge website. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.851</span></span></p>

                  <p>Task-oriented grasping (TOG) refers to the problem of predicting grasps on an object that enable subsequent manipulation tasks.To model the complex relationships between objects, tasks, and grasps, existing methods incorporate semantic knowledge as priors into TOG pipelines.However, the existing semantic knowledge is typically constructed based on closed-world concept sets, restraining the generalization to novel concepts out of the pre-defined sets.To address this issue, we propose GraspGPT, a large language model (LLM) based TOG framework that leverages the open-end semantic knowledge from an LLM to achieve zero-shot generalization to novel concepts.We conduct experiments on Language Augmented TaskGrasp (LA-TaskGrasp) dataset and demonstrate that GraspGPT outperforms existing TOG methods on different held-out settings when generalizing to novel concepts out of the training set.The effectiveness of GraspGPT is further validated in real-robot experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, data, appendix, and video are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/graspgpt/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.803</span></span></p>

                  <p>Code coverage is a widely used metric for quantifying the extent to which program elements, such as statements or branches, are executed during testing.Calculating code coverage is resource-intensive, requiring code building and execution with additional overhead for the instrumentation.Furthermore, computing coverage of any snippet of code requires the whole program context.Using Machine Learning to amortize this expensive process could lower the cost of code coverage by requiring only the source code context, and the task of code coverage prediction can be a novel benchmark for judging the ability of models to understand code.We propose a novel benchmark task called Code Coverage Prediction for Large Language Models (LLMs).We formalize this task to evaluate the capability of LLMs in understanding code execution by determining which lines of a method are executed by a given test case and inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We curate and release a dataset we call COVERAGEEVAL by executing tests and code from the HumanEval dataset and collecting code coverage information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.914</span></span>We report the performance of four state-of-the-art LLMs used for code-related tasks, including OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, Google's BARD, and Anthropic's Claude, on the Code Coverage Prediction task.Finally, we argue that code coverage as a metric and pre-training data source are valuable for overall LLM performance on software engineering tasks.</p>

                  <p>In a conventional Speech emotion recognition (SER) task, a classifier for a given language is trained on a pre-existing dataset for that same language.However, where training data for a language does not exist, data from other languages can be used instead.We experiment with cross-lingual and multilingual SER, working with Amharic, English, German and URDU.For Amharic, we use our own publicly-available Amharic Speech Emotion Dataset (ASED).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For English, German and Urdu we use the existing RAVDESS, EMO-DB and URDU datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span>We followed previous research in mapping labels for all datasets to just two classes, positive and negative.Thus we can compare performance on different languages directly, and combine languages for training and testing.In Experiment 1, monolingual SER trials were carried out using three classifiers, AlexNet, VGGE (a proposed variant of VGG), and ResNet50.Results averaged for the three models were very similar for ASED and RAVDESS, suggesting that Amharic and English SER are equally difficult.Similarly, German SER is more difficult, and Urdu SER is easier.In Experiment 2, we trained on one language and tested on another, in both directions for each pair:Amharic<->German, Amharic<->English, and Amharic<->Urdu.Results with Amharic as target suggested that using English or German as source will give the best result.In Experiment 3, we trained on several non-Amharic languages and then tested on Amharic.The best accuracy obtained was several percent greater than the best accuracy in Experiment 2, suggesting that a better result can be obtained when using two or three non-Amharic languages for training than when using just one non-Amharic language.Overall, the results suggest that cross-lingual and multilingual training can be an effective strategy for training a SER classifier when resources for a language are scarce.</p>

This paper presents the first study on the problem of assembly clone search with unseen architectures and libraries.We propose incorporating human common knowledge through large-scale pre-trained natural language models, in the form of transfer learning, into current learning-based approaches for assembly clone search.Transfer learning can aid in addressing the limitations of the existing approaches, as it can bring in broader knowledge from human experts in assembly code.We further address the sequence limit issue by proposing a reinforcement learning agent to remove unnecessary and redundant tokens.Coupled with a new Variational Information Bottleneck learning strategy, the proposed system minimizes the reliance on potential indicators of architectures and optimization settings, for a better generalization of unseen architectures.We simulate the unseen architecture clone search scenarios and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

                  <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing rapidly and so the need of ensuring protection against cybersecurity attacks to IoT devices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this scenario, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) play a crucial role and data-driven IDSs based on machine learning (ML) have recently attracted more and more interest by the research community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>While conventional ML-based IDSs are based on a centralized architecture where IoT devices share their data with a central server for model training, we propose a novel approach that is based on federated learning (FL).However, conventional FL is ineffective in the considered scenario, due to the high statistical heterogeneity of data collected by IoT devices.To overcome this limitation, we propose a three-tier FL-based architecture where IoT devices are clustered together based on their statistical properties.Clustering decisions are taken by means of a novel entropy-based strategy, which helps improve model training performance.We tested our solution on the CIC-ToN-IoT dataset: our clustering strategy increases intrusion detection performance with respect to a conventional FL approach up to +17% in terms of F1-score, along with a significant reduction of the number of training rounds.</p>
