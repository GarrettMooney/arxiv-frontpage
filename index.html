                  <p>Democratizing access to natural language processing (NLP) technology is crucial, especially for underrepresented and extremely low-resource languages.Previous research has focused on developing labeled and unlabeled corpora for these languages through online scraping and document translation.While these methods have proven effective and cost-efficient, we have identified limitations in the resulting corpora, including a lack of lexical diversity and cultural relevance to local communities.To address this gap, we conduct a case study on Indonesian local languages.We compare the effectiveness of online scraping, human translation, and paragraph writing by native speakers in constructing datasets.Our findings demonstrate that datasets generated through paragraph writing by native speakers exhibit superior quality in terms of lexical diversity and cultural content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we present the \datasetname{} benchmark, encompassing 12 underrepresented and extremely low-resource languages spoken by millions of individuals in Indonesia. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.873</span></span>Our empirical experiment results using existing multilingual large language models conclude the need to extend these models to more underrepresented languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the NusaWrites dataset at https://github.com/IndoNLP/nusa-writes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span></p>

                  <p>An accurate motion model is a fundamental component of most autonomous navigation systems.While much work has been done on improving model formulation, no standard protocol exists for gathering empirical data required to train models.In this work, we address this issue by proposing Data-driven Robot Input Vector Exploration (DRIVE), a protocol that enables characterizing uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) input limits and gathering empirical model training data.We also propose a novel learned slip approach outperforming similar acceleration learning approaches.Our contributions are validated through an extensive experimental evaluation, cumulating over 7 km and 1.8 h of driving data over three distinct UGVs and four terrain types.We show that our protocol offers increased predictive performance over common human-driven data-gathering protocols.Furthermore, our protocol converges with 46 s of training data, almost four times less than the shortest human dataset gathering protocol.We show that the operational limit for our model is reached in extreme slip conditions encountered on surfaced ice.DRIVE is an efficient way of characterizing UGV motion in its operational conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are both available online at this link: https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/DRIVE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the development of deep learning, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has made significant progress.To further enhance the performance, revising recognition results is one of the lightweight but efficient manners.Various methods can be roughly classified into N-best reranking methods and error correction models.The former aims to select the hypothesis with the lowest error rate from a set of candidates generated by ASR for a given input speech.The latter focuses on detecting recognition errors in a given hypothesis and correcting these errors to obtain an enhanced result.However, we observe that these studies are hardly comparable to each other as they are usually evaluated on different corpora, paired with different ASR models, and even use different datasets to train the models.Accordingly, we first concentrate on releasing an ASR hypothesis revising (HypR) dataset in this study.HypR contains several commonly used corpora (AISHELL-1, TED-LIUM 2, and LibriSpeech) and provides 50 recognition hypotheses for each speech utterance.The checkpoint models of the ASR are also published.In addition, we implement and compare several classic and representative methods, showing the recent research progress in revising speech recognition results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope the publicly available HypR dataset can become a reference benchmark for subsequent research and promote the school of research to an advanced level. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span></p>

                  <p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) employ multi-view images for 3D scene representation and have shown remarkable performance.As one of the primary sources of multi-view images, multi-camera systems encounter challenges such as varying intrinsic parameters and frequent pose changes.Most previous NeRF-based methods often assume a global unique camera and seldom consider scenarios with multiple cameras.Besides, some pose-robust methods still remain susceptible to suboptimal solutions when poses are poor initialized.In this paper, we propose MC-NeRF, a method can jointly optimize both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters for bundle-adjusting Neural Radiance Fields.Firstly, we conduct a theoretical analysis to tackle the degenerate case and coupling issue that arise from the joint optimization between intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.Secondly, based on the proposed solutions, we introduce an efficient calibration image acquisition scheme for multi-camera systems, including the design of calibration object.Lastly, we present a global end-to-end network with training sequence that enables the regression of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, along with the rendering network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, most existing datasets are designed for unique camera, we create a new dataset that includes four different styles of multi-camera acquisition systems, allowing readers to generate custom datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.914</span></span>Experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method when each image corresponds to different camera parameters.Specifically, we adopt up to 110 images with 110 different intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, to achieve 3D scene representation without providing initial poses.The Code and supplementary materials are available at https://in2-viaun.github.io/MC-NeRF.</p>

                  <p>Video-based remote physiological measurement utilizes facial videos to measure the blood volume change signal, which is also called remote photoplethysmography (rPPG).Supervised methods for rPPG measurements have been shown to achieve good performance.However, the drawback of these methods is that they require facial videos with ground truth (GT) physiological signals, which are often costly and difficult to obtain.In this paper, we propose Contrast-Phys+, a method that can be trained in both unsupervised and weakly-supervised settings.We employ a 3DCNN model to generate multiple spatiotemporal rPPG signals and incorporate prior knowledge of rPPG into a contrastive loss function.We further incorporate the GT signals into contrastive learning to adapt to partial or misaligned labels.The contrastive loss encourages rPPG/GT signals from the same video to be grouped together, while pushing those from different videos apart.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our methods on five publicly available datasets that include both RGB and Near-infrared videos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>Contrast-Phys+ outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised methods, even when using partially available or misaligned GT signals, or no labels at all.Additionally, we highlight the advantages of our methods in terms of computational efficiency, noise robustness, and generalization.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays millions of images are shared on social media and web platforms.In particular, many of them are food images taken from a smartphone over time, providing information related to the individual's diet.On the other hand, eating behaviours are directly related to some of the most prevalent diseases in the world.Exploiting recent advances in image processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI), this scenario represents an excellent opportunity to: i) create new methods that analyse the individuals' health from what they eat, and ii) develop personalised recommendations to improve nutrition and diet under specific circumstances (e.g., obesity or COVID).Having tunable tools for creating food image datasets that facilitate research in both lines is very much needed.   This paper proposes AI4Food-NutritionFW, a framework for the creation of food image datasets according to configurable eating behaviours.AI4Food-NutritionFW simulates a user-friendly and widespread scenario where images are taken using a smartphone.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to the framework, we also provide and describe a unique food image dataset that includes 4,800 different weekly eating behaviours from 15 different profiles and 1,200 subjects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span>Specifically, we consider profiles that comply with actual lifestyles from healthy eating behaviours (according to established knowledge), variable profiles (e.g., eating out, holidays), to unhealthy ones (e.g., excess of fast food or sweets).Finally, we automatically evaluate a healthy index of the subject's eating behaviours using multidimensional metrics based on guidelines for healthy diets proposed by international organisations, achieving promising results (99.53% and 99.60% accuracy and sensitivity, respectively).We also release to the research community a software implementation of our proposed AI4Food-NutritionFW and the mentioned food image dataset created with it.</p>

                  <p>Social media platforms play an essential role in crisis communication, but analyzing crisis-related social media texts is challenging due to their informal nature.Transformer-based pre-trained models like BERT and RoBERTa have shown success in various NLP tasks, but they are not tailored for crisis-related texts.Furthermore, general-purpose sentence encoders are used to generate sentence embeddings, regardless of the textual complexities in crisis-related texts.Advances in applications like text classification, semantic search, and clustering contribute to effective processing of crisis-related texts, which is essential for emergency responders to gain a comprehensive view of a crisis event, whether historical or real-time.To address these gaps in crisis informatics literature, this study introduces CrisisTransformers, an ensemble of pre-trained language models and sentence encoders trained on an extensive corpus of over 15 billion word tokens from tweets associated with more than 30 crisis events, including disease outbreaks, natural disasters, conflicts, and other critical incidents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate existing models and CrisisTransformers on 18 crisis-specific public datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span>Our pre-trained models outperform strong baselines across all datasets in classification tasks, and our best-performing sentence encoder improves the state-of-the-art by 17.43% in sentence encoding tasks.Additionally, we investigate the impact of model initialization on convergence and evaluate the significance of domain-specific models in generating semantically meaningful sentence embeddings.All models are publicly released (https://huggingface.co/crisistransformers), with the anticipation that they will serve as a robust baseline for tasks involving the analysis of crisis-related social media texts.</p>

                  <p>Malicious communication behavior is the network communication behavior generated by malware (bot-net, spyware, etc.)after victim devices are infected.Experienced adversaries often hide malicious information in HTTP traffic to evade detection.However, related detection methods have inadequate generalization ability because they are usually based on artificial feature engineering and outmoded datasets.In this paper, we propose an HTTP-based Malicious Communication traffic Detection Model (HMCD-Model) based on generated adversarial flows and hierarchical traffic features.HMCD-Model consists of two parts.The first is a generation algorithm based on WGAN-GP to generate HTTP-based malicious communication traffic for data enhancement.The second is a hybrid neural network based on CNN and LSTM to extract hierarchical spatial-temporal features of traffic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we collect and publish a dataset, HMCT-2020, which consists of large-scale malicious and benign traffic during three years (2018-2020). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span>Taking the data in HMCT-2020(18) as the training set and the data in other datasets as the test set, the experimental results show that the HMCD-Model can effectively detect unknown HTTP-based malicious communication traffic.It can reach F1 = 98.66% in the dataset HMCT-2020(19-20), F1 = 90.69% in the public dataset CIC-IDS-2017, and F1 = 83.66% in the real traffic, which is 20+% higher than other representative methods on average.This validates that HMCD-Model has the ability to discover unknown HTTP-based malicious communication behavior.</p>

                  <p>Current scene graph datasets suffer from strong long-tail distributions of their predicate classes.Due to a very low number of some predicate classes in the test sets, no reliable metrics can be retrieved for the rarest classes.We construct a new panoptic scene graph dataset and a set of metrics that are designed as a benchmark for the predictive performance especially on rare predicate classes.To construct the new dataset, we propose a model-assisted annotation pipeline that efficiently finds rare predicate classes that are hidden in a large set of images like needles in a haystack.   Contrary to prior scene graph datasets, Haystack contains explicit negative annotations, i.e. annotations that a given relation does not have a certain predicate class.Negative annotations are helpful especially in the field of scene graph generation and open up a whole new set of possibilities to improve current scene graph generation models.   Haystack is 100% compatible with existing panoptic scene graph datasets and can easily be integrated with existing evaluation pipelines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code can be found here: https://lorjul.github.io/haystack/.

                  <p>We introduce the structured scene-text spotting task, which requires a scene-text OCR system to spot text in the wild according to a query regular expression.Contrary to generic scene text OCR, structured scene-text spotting seeks to dynamically condition both scene text detection and recognition on user-provided regular expressions.To tackle this task, we propose the Structured TExt sPotter (STEP), a model that exploits the provided text structure to guide the OCR process.STEP is able to deal with regular expressions that contain spaces and it is not bound to detection at the word-level granularity.Our approach enables accurate zero-shot structured text spotting in a wide variety of real-world reading scenarios and is solely trained on publicly available data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce a new challenging test dataset that contains several types of out-of-vocabulary structured text, reflecting important reading applications of fields such as prices, dates, serial numbers, license plates etc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>We demonstrate that STEP can provide specialised OCR performance on demand in all tested scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Labeling neural network submodules with human-legible descriptions is useful for many downstream tasks: such descriptions can surface failures, guide interventions, and perhaps even explain important model behaviors.To date, most mechanistic descriptions of trained networks have involved small models, narrowly delimited phenomena, and large amounts of human labor.Labeling all human-interpretable sub-computations in models of increasing size and complexity will almost certainly require tools that can generate and validate descriptions automatically.Recently, techniques that use learned models in-the-loop for labeling have begun to gain traction, but methods for evaluating their efficacy are limited and ad-hoc.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>How should we validate and compare open-ended labeling tools? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>This paper introduces FIND (Function INterpretation and Description), a benchmark suite for evaluating the building blocks of automated interpretability methods.FIND contains functions that resemble components of trained neural networks, and accompanying descriptions of the kind we seek to generate.The functions are procedurally constructed across textual and numeric domains, and involve a range of real-world complexities, including noise, composition, approximation, and bias.We evaluate new and existing methods that use language models (LMs) to produce code-based and language descriptions of function behavior.We find that an off-the-shelf LM augmented with only black-box access to functions can sometimes infer their structure, acting as a scientist by forming hypotheses, proposing experiments, and updating descriptions in light of new data.However, LM-based descriptions tend to capture global function behavior and miss local corruptions.These results show that FIND will be useful for characterizing the performance of more sophisticated interpretability methods before they are applied to real-world models.</p>
