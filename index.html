                  <p>Accurate depth estimation under out-of-distribution (OoD) scenarios, such as adverse weather conditions, sensor failure, and noise contamination, is desirable for safety-critical applications.Existing depth estimation systems, however, suffer inevitably from real-world corruptions and perturbations and are struggled to provide reliable depth predictions under such cases.In this paper, we summarize the winning solutions from the RoboDepth Challenge -- an academic competition designed to facilitate and advance robust OoD depth estimation.This challenge was developed based on the newly established KITTI-C and NYUDepth2-C benchmarks.We hosted two stand-alone tracks, with an emphasis on robust self-supervised and robust fully-supervised depth estimation, respectively.Out of more than two hundred participants, nine unique and top-performing solutions have appeared, with novel designs ranging from the following aspects: spatial- and frequency-domain augmentations, masked image modeling, image restoration and super-resolution, adversarial training, diffusion-based noise suppression, vision-language pre-training, learned model ensembling, and hierarchical feature enhancement.Extensive experimental analyses along with insightful observations are drawn to better understand the rationale behind each design.We hope this challenge could lay a solid foundation for future research on robust and reliable depth estimation and beyond.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets, competition toolkit, workshop recordings, and source code from the winning teams are publicly available on the challenge website. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.871</span></span></p>

                  <p>Grammatical error correction aims to correct ungrammatical sentences automatically.Recently, some work has demonstrated the excellent capabilities of closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) in grammatical error correction.However, the potential of open-source LLMs remains unexplored.In this paper, we introduced GrammarGPT, an open-source LLM, to preliminary explore its potential for native Chinese grammatical error correction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The core recipe of GrammarGPT is to leverage the hybrid dataset of ChatGPT-generated and human-annotated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>For grammatical errors with clues, we proposed a heuristic method to guide ChatGPT to generate ungrammatical sentences by providing those clues.For grammatical errors without clues, we collected ungrammatical sentences from publicly available websites and manually corrected them.In addition, we employed an error-invariant augmentation method to enhance the ability of the model to correct native Chinese grammatical errors.We ultimately constructed about 1k parallel data and utilized these data to fine-tune open-source LLMs (e.g., Phoenix, released by The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen) with instruction tuning.The experimental results show that GrammarGPT outperforms the existing SOTA system significantly.Although model parameters are 20x larger than the SOTA baseline, the required amount of data for instruction tuning is 1200x smaller, illustrating the potential of open-source LLMs on native CGEC.Our GrammarGPT ranks $3^{rd}$ on NLPCC2023 SharedTask1, demonstrating our approach's effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/GrammarGPT}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span></p>

                  <p>Code coverage is a widely used metric for quantifying the extent to which program elements, such as statements or branches, are executed during testing.Calculating code coverage is resource-intensive, requiring code building and execution with additional overhead for the instrumentation.Furthermore, computing coverage of any snippet of code requires the whole program context.Using Machine Learning to amortize this expensive process could lower the cost of code coverage by requiring only the source code context, and the task of code coverage prediction can be a novel benchmark for judging the ability of models to understand code.We propose a novel benchmark task called Code Coverage Prediction for Large Language Models (LLMs).We formalize this task to evaluate the capability of LLMs in understanding code execution by determining which lines of a method are executed by a given test case and inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We curate and release a dataset we call COVERAGEEVAL by executing tests and code from the HumanEval dataset and collecting code coverage information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span>We report the performance of four state-of-the-art LLMs used for code-related tasks, including OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, Google's BARD, and Anthropic's Claude, on the Code Coverage Prediction task.Finally, we argue that code coverage as a metric and pre-training data source are valuable for overall LLM performance on software engineering tasks.</p>

                  <p>Performance issues permeate large-scale cloud service systems, which can lead to huge revenue losses.To ensure reliable performance, it's essential to accurately identify and localize these issues using service monitoring metrics.Given the complexity and scale of modern cloud systems, this task can be challenging and may require extensive expertise and resources beyond the capacity of individual humans.Some existing methods tackle this problem by analyzing each metric independently to detect anomalies.However, this could incur overwhelming alert storms that are difficult for engineers to diagnose manually.To pursue better performance, not only the temporal patterns of metrics but also the correlation between metrics (i.e., relational patterns) should be considered, which can be formulated as a multivariate metrics anomaly detection problem.However, most of the studies fall short of extracting these two types of features explicitly.Moreover, there exist some unlabeled anomalies mixed in the training data, which may hinder the detection performance.To address these limitations, we propose the Relational- Temporal Anomaly Detection Model (RTAnomaly) that combines the relational and temporal information of metrics.RTAnomaly employs a graph attention layer to learn the dependencies among metrics, which will further help pinpoint the anomalous metrics that may cause the anomaly effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we exploit the concept of positive unlabeled learning to address the issue of potential anomalies in the training data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>To evaluate our method, we conduct experiments on a public dataset and two industrial datasets.RTAnomaly outperforms all the baseline models by achieving an average F1 score of 0.929 and Hit@3 of 0.920, demonstrating its superiority.</p>

                  <p>In safety-critical classification tasks, conformal prediction allows to perform rigorous uncertainty quantification by providing confidence sets including the true class with a user-specified probability.This generally assumes the availability of a held-out calibration set with access to ground truth labels.Unfortunately, in many domains, such labels are difficult to obtain and usually approximated by aggregating expert opinions.In fact, this holds true for almost all datasets, including well-known ones such as CIFAR and ImageNet.Applying conformal prediction using such labels underestimates uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Indeed, when expert opinions are not resolvable, there is inherent ambiguity present in the labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>That is, we do not have ``crisp'', definitive ground truth labels and this uncertainty should be taken into account during calibration.In this paper, we develop a conformal prediction framework for such ambiguous ground truth settings which relies on an approximation of the underlying posterior distribution of labels given inputs.We demonstrate our methodology on synthetic and real datasets, including a case study of skin condition classification in dermatology.</p>

This paper presents the first study on the problem of assembly clone search with unseen architectures and libraries.We propose incorporating human common knowledge through large-scale pre-trained natural language models, in the form of transfer learning, into current learning-based approaches for assembly clone search.Transfer learning can aid in addressing the limitations of the existing approaches, as it can bring in broader knowledge from human experts in assembly code.We further address the sequence limit issue by proposing a reinforcement learning agent to remove unnecessary and redundant tokens.Coupled with a new Variational Information Bottleneck learning strategy, the proposed system minimizes the reliance on potential indicators of architectures and optimization settings, for a better generalization of unseen architectures.We simulate the unseen architecture clone search scenarios and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art solutions.</p>
