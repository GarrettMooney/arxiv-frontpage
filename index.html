                  <p>3D vision-language grounding, which focuses on aligning language with the 3D physical environment, stands as a cornerstone in the development of embodied agents.In comparison to recent advancements in the 2D domain, grounding language in 3D scenes faces several significant challenges: (i) the inherent complexity of 3D scenes due to the diverse object configurations, their rich attributes, and intricate relationships; (ii) the scarcity of paired 3D vision-language data to support grounded learning; and (iii) the absence of a unified learning framework to distill knowledge from grounded 3D data.In this work, we aim to address these three major challenges in 3D vision-language by examining the potential of systematically upscaling 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse, encompassing about 68K 3D indoor scenes and comprising 2.5M vision-language pairs derived from both human annotations and our scalable scene-graph-based generation approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.917</span></span>We demonstrate that this scaling allows for a unified pre-training framework, Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), for 3D vision-language learning.Through extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of GPS by achieving state-of-the-art performance on all existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks.The vast potential of SceneVerse and GPS is unveiled through zero-shot transfer experiments in the challenging 3D vision-language tasks.Project website: https://scene-verse.github.io .</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased striking results on existing logical reasoning benchmarks, with some models even surpassing human performance.However, the true depth of their competencies and robustness, in mathematical reasoning tasks, remains an open question.In response, we develop (i) an ontology of perturbations of maths questions, (ii) a semi-automatic method of perturbation, and (iii) a dataset of perturbed maths questions to probe the limits of LLM capabilities in mathematical reasoning tasks.These controlled perturbations span across multiple fine dimensions of the structural and representational aspects of maths questions.Using GPT-4, we generated the MORE dataset by perturbing randomly selected five seed questions from GSM8K. This process was guided by our ontology and involved a thorough automatic and manual filtering process, yielding a set of 216 maths problems.We conducted comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs on MORE.The results show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions.This strongly suggests that current LLMs lack robust mathematical skills and deep reasoning abilities.This research not only identifies multiple gaps in the capabilities of current models, but also highlights multiple potential directions for future development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset will be made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/GSM8k_MORE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span></p>

                  <p>There are two common ways in which developers are incorporating proprietary and domain-specific data when building applications of Large Language Models (LLMs): Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-Tuning.RAG augments the prompt with the external data, while fine-Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself.However, the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood.In this paper, we propose a pipeline for fine-tuning and RAG, and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs, including Llama2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.Our pipeline consists of multiple stages, including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers, using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results.We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine-Tuning pipeline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p.when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further.In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%.Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.</p>

                  <p>Recently, 3D point cloud classification has made significant progress with the help of many datasets.However, these datasets do not reflect the incomplete nature of real-world point clouds caused by occlusion, which limits the practical application of current methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this gap, we propose ModelNet-O, a large-scale synthetic dataset of 123,041 samples that emulate real-world point clouds with self-occlusion caused by scanning from monocular cameras. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>ModelNet-O is 10 times larger than existing datasets and offers more challenging cases to evaluate the robustness of existing methods.Our observation on ModelNet-O reveals that well-designed sparse structures can preserve structural information of point clouds under occlusion, motivating us to propose a robust point cloud processing method that leverages a critical point sampling (CPS) strategy in a multi-level manner.We term our method PointMLS.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our PointMLS achieves state-of-the-art results on ModelNet-O and competitive results on regular datasets, and it is robust and effective.More experiments also demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of PointMLS.</p>

                  <p>The evolution of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been significantly influenced by six core challenges (Koehn and Knowles, 2017), which have acted as benchmarks for progress in this field.This study revisits these challenges, offering insights into their ongoing relevance in the context of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): domain mismatch, amount of parallel data, rare word prediction, translation of long sentences, attention model as word alignment, and sub-optimal beam search.Our empirical findings indicate that LLMs effectively lessen the reliance on parallel data for major languages in the pretraining phase.Additionally, the LLM-based translation system significantly enhances the translation of long sentences that contain approximately 80 words and shows the capability to translate documents of up to 512 words.However, despite these significant improvements, the challenges of domain mismatch and prediction of rare words persist.While the challenges of word alignment and beam search, specifically associated with NMT, may not apply to LLMs, we identify three new challenges for LLMs in translation tasks: inference efficiency, translation of low-resource languages in the pretraining phase, and human-aligned evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets and models are released at https://github.com/pangjh3/LLM4MT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks in different modalities.However, existing multi-modal models primarily emphasize capturing global information within each modality while neglecting the importance of perceiving local information across modalities.Consequently, these models lack the ability to effectively understand the fine-grained details of input data, limiting their performance in tasks that require a more nuanced understanding.To address this limitation, there is a compelling need to develop models that enable fine-grained understanding across multiple modalities, thereby enhancing their applicability to a wide range of tasks.In this paper, we propose LEGO, a language enhanced multi-modal grounding model.Beyond capturing global information like other multi-modal models, our proposed model excels at tasks demanding a detailed understanding of local information within the input.It demonstrates precise identification and localization of specific regions in images or moments in videos.To achieve this objective, we design a diversified dataset construction pipeline, resulting in a multi-modal, multi-granularity dataset for model training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code, dataset, and demo of our model can be found at https: //github.com/lzw-lzw/LEGO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used in training large language models~(LLMs) for preventing unexpected outputs, \eg reducing harmfulness and errors.However, existing RL methods mostly adopt the instance-level reward, which is unable to provide fine-grained supervision for complex reasoning tasks, and can not focus on the few key tokens that lead to the incorrectness.To address it, we propose a new RL method named \textbf{RLMEC} that incorporates a generative model as the reward model, which is trained by the erroneous solution rewriting task under the minimum editing constraint, and can produce token-level rewards for RL training.Based on the generative reward model, we design the token-level RL objective for training and an imitation-based regularization for stabilizing RL process.And the both objectives focus on the learning of the key tokens for the erroneous solution, reducing the effect of other unimportant tokens.The experiment results on mathematical tasks and question-answering tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RLMEC}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large archival collections, such as email or government documents, must be manually reviewed to identify any sensitive information before the collection can be released publicly.Sensitivity classification has received a lot of attention in the literature.However, more recently, there has been increasing interest in developing sensitivity-aware search engines that can provide users with relevant search results, while ensuring that no sensitive documents are returned to the user.Sensitivity-aware search would mitigate the need for a manual sensitivity review prior to collections being made available publicly.To develop such systems, there is a need for test collections that contain relevance assessments for a set of information needs as well as ground-truth labels for a variety of sensitivity categories.The well-known Enron email collection contains a classification ground-truth that can be used to represent sensitive information, e.g., the Purely Personal and Personal but in Professional Context categories can be used to represent sensitive personal information.However, the existing Enron collection does not contain a set of information needs and relevance assessments.In this work, we present a collection of fifty information needs (topics) with crowdsourced query formulations (3 per topic) and relevance assessments (11,471 in total) for the Enron collection (mean number of relevant documents per topic = 11, variance = 34.7).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The developed information needs, queries and relevance judgements are available on GitHub and will be available along with the existing Enron collection through the popular ir_datasets library. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>Our proposed collection results in the first freely available test collection for developing sensitivity-aware search systems.</p>

                  <p>The argument sufficiency assessment task aims to determine if the premises of a given argument support its conclusion.To tackle this task, existing works often train a classifier on data annotated by humans.However, annotating data is laborious, and annotations are often inconsistent due to subjective criteria.Motivated by the probability of sufficiency (PS) definition in the causal literature, we propose CASA, a zero-shot causality-driven argument sufficiency assessment framework.PS measures how likely introducing the premise event would lead to the conclusion, when both the premise and conclusion events are absent.To estimate this probability, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to generate contexts that are inconsistent with the premise and conclusion, and revise them by injecting the premise event.Experiments on two logical fallacy detection datasets demonstrate that CASA accurately identifies insufficient arguments.We further deploy CASA in a writing assistance application, and find that suggestions generated by CASA enhance the sufficiency of student-written arguments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/xxxiaol/CASA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span></p>

                  <p>In an era where test-time adaptation methods increasingly rely on the nuanced manipulation of batch normalization (BN) parameters, one critical assumption often goes overlooked: that of independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>test batches with respect to unknown labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>This assumption culminates in biased estimates of BN statistics and jeopardizes system stability under non-i.i.d. conditions.This paper pioneers a departure from the i.i.d. paradigm by introducing a groundbreaking strategy termed "Un-Mixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics" (UnMix-TNS).UnMix-TNS re-calibrates the instance-wise statistics used to normalize each instance in a batch by mixing it with multiple unmixed statistics components, thus inherently simulating the i.i.d. environment.The key lies in our innovative online unmixing procedure, which persistently refines these statistics components by drawing upon the closest instances from an incoming test batch.Remarkably generic in its design, UnMix-TNS seamlessly integrates with an array of state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods and pre-trained architectures equipped with BN layers.Empirical evaluations corroborate the robustness of UnMix-TNS under varied scenarios ranging from single to continual and mixed domain shifts.UnMix-TNS stands out when handling test data streams with temporal correlation, including those with corrupted real-world non-i.i.d. streams, sustaining its efficacy even with minimal batch sizes and individual samples.Our results set a new standard for test-time adaptation, demonstrating significant improvements in both stability and performance across multiple benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Recently, in-memory analog matrix computing (AMC) with nonvolatile resistive memory has been developed for solving matrix problems in one step, e.g., matrix inversion of solving linear systems.However, the analog nature sets up a barrier to the scalability of AMC, due to the limits on the manufacturability and yield of resistive memory arrays, non-idealities of device and circuit, and cost of hardware implementations.Aiming to deliver a scalable AMC approach for solving linear systems, this work presents BlockAMC, which partitions a large original matrix into smaller ones on different memory arrays.A macro is designed to perform matrix inversion and matrix-vector multiplication with the block matrices, obtaining the partial solutions to recover the original solution.The size of block matrices can be exponentially reduced by performing multiple stages of divide-and-conquer, resulting in a two-stage solver design that enhances the scalability of this approach.BlockAMC is also advantageous in alleviating the accuracy issue of AMC, especially in the presence of device and circuit non-idealities, such as conductance variations and interconnect resistances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to a single AMC circuit solving the same problem, BlockAMC improves the area and energy efficiency by 48.83% and 40%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

                  <p>While deep neural networks have achieved remarkable performance, data augmentation has emerged as a crucial strategy to mitigate overfitting and enhance network performance.These techniques hold particular significance in industrial manufacturing contexts.Recently, image mixing-based methods have been introduced, exhibiting improved performance on public benchmark datasets.However, their application to industrial tasks remains challenging.The manufacturing environment generates massive amounts of unlabeled data on a daily basis, with only a few instances of abnormal data occurrences.This leads to severe data imbalance.Thus, creating well-balanced datasets is not straightforward due to the high costs associated with labeling.Nonetheless, this is a crucial step for enhancing productivity.For this reason, we introduce ContextMix, a method tailored for industrial applications and benchmark datasets.ContextMix generates novel data by resizing entire images and integrating them into other images within the batch.This approach enables our method to learn discriminative features based on varying sizes from resized images and train informative secondary features for object recognition using occluded images.With the minimal additional computation cost of image resizing, ContextMix enhances performance compared to existing augmentation techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate its effectiveness across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using various network architectures on public benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our proposed method demonstrates improved results across a range of robustness tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Its efficacy in real industrial environments is particularly noteworthy, as demonstrated using the passive component dataset.</p>

                  <p>Wireless Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, particularly gaining momentum in domains with confidential and private data on mobile clients.However, the location-dependent performance, in terms of transmission rates and susceptibility to transmission errors, poses major challenges for wireless FL's convergence speed and accuracy.The challenge is more acute for hostile environments without a metric that authenticates the data quality and security profile of the clients.In this context, this paper proposes a novel risk-aware accelerated FL framework that accounts for the clients heterogeneity in the amount of possessed data, transmission rates, transmission errors, and trustworthiness.Classifying clients according to their location-dependent performance and trustworthiness profiles, we propose a dynamic risk-aware global model aggregation scheme that allows clients to participate in descending order of their transmission rates and an ascending trustworthiness constraint.In particular, the transmission rate is the dominant participation criterion for initial rounds to accelerate the convergence speed.Our model then progressively relaxes the transmission rate restriction to explore more training data at cell-edge clients.The aggregation rounds incorporate a debiasing factor that accounts for transmission errors.Risk-awareness is enabled by a validation set, where the base station eliminates non-trustworthy clients at the fine-tuning stage.The proposed scheme is benchmarked against a conservative scheme (i.e., only allowing trustworthy devices) and an aggressive scheme (i.e., oblivious to the trust metric).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The numerical results highlight the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of accuracy and convergence speed when compared to both benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span></p>

Due to its worst-case nature, there is an almost-linear $\Omega(|I|^{1-\epsilon})$ regret lower bound, when only one query per round is allowed [Daniely el al, ICML 2015].Surprisingly, with just two queries per round, we give Strongly Adaptive Bandit Learner (StABL) that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n|I|})$ adaptive regret for multi-armed bandits with $n$ arms.The bound is tight and cannot be improved in general.Our algorithm leverages a multiplicative update scheme of varying stepsizes and a carefully chosen observation distribution to control the variance.Furthermore, we extend our results and provide optimal algorithms in the bandit convex optimization setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms under volatile environments and for downstream tasks, such as algorithm selection for hyperparameter optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>As deep learning (DL) models are widely and effectively used in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms, there is a rapidly growing interest in DL watermarking techniques that can be used to confirm the ownership of a particular model.Unfortunately, these methods usually produce watermarks susceptible to model stealing attacks.In our research, we introduce a novel trigger set-based watermarking approach that demonstrates resilience against functionality stealing attacks, particularly those involving extraction and distillation.Our approach does not require additional model training and can be applied to any model architecture.The key idea of our method is to compute the trigger set, which is transferable between the source model and the set of proxy models with a high probability.In our experimental study, we show that if the probability of the set being transferable is reasonably high, it can be effectively used for ownership verification of the stolen model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on multiple benchmarks and show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art watermarking techniques in all considered experimental setups. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span></p>

                  <p>In an era where test-time adaptation methods increasingly rely on the nuanced manipulation of batch normalization (BN) parameters, one critical assumption often goes overlooked: that of independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)test batches with respect to unknown labels.This assumption culminates in biased estimates of BN statistics and jeopardizes system stability under non-i.i.d. conditions.This paper pioneers a departure from the i.i.d. paradigm by introducing a groundbreaking strategy termed "Un-Mixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics" (UnMix-TNS).UnMix-TNS re-calibrates the instance-wise statistics used to normalize each instance in a batch by mixing it with multiple unmixed statistics components, thus inherently simulating the i.i.d. environment.The key lies in our innovative online unmixing procedure, which persistently refines these statistics components by drawing upon the closest instances from an incoming test batch.Remarkably generic in its design, UnMix-TNS seamlessly integrates with an array of state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods and pre-trained architectures equipped with BN layers.Empirical evaluations corroborate the robustness of UnMix-TNS under varied scenarios ranging from single to continual and mixed domain shifts.UnMix-TNS stands out when handling test data streams with temporal correlation, including those with corrupted real-world non-i.i.d. streams, sustaining its efficacy even with minimal batch sizes and individual samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results set a new standard for test-time adaptation, demonstrating significant improvements in both stability and performance across multiple benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span></p>

                  <p>Commit messages are natural language descriptions of code changes, which are important for software evolution such as code understanding and maintenance.However, previous methods are trained on the entire dataset without considering the fact that a portion of commit messages adhere to good practice (i.e., good-practice commits), while the rest do not.On the basis of our empirical study, we discover that training on good-practice commits significantly contributes to the commit message generation.Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel knowledge-aware denoising learning method called KADEL.Considering that good-practice commits constitute only a small proportion of the dataset, we align the remaining training samples with these good-practice commits.To achieve this, we propose a model that learns the commit knowledge by training on good-practice commits.This knowledge model enables supplementing more information for training samples that do not conform to good practice.However, since the supplementary information may contain noise or prediction errors, we propose a dynamic denoising training method.This method composes a distribution-aware confidence function and a dynamic distribution list, which enhances the effectiveness of the training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on the whole MCMD dataset demonstrate that our method overall achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Our source code and data are available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/KADEL</p>

In this paper, we obtain both upper and lower bounds for this problem.In particular, we show that the problem of finding the best data distribution from selectivity queries is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete.On the positive side, we describe a Monte Carlo algorithm that constructs, in time $O((n+\delta^{-d})\delta^{-2}\mathop{\mathrm{polylog}})$, a discrete distribution $\tilde{\mathcal{D}}$ of size $O(\delta^{-2})$, such that $\mathrm{err}_p(\tilde{\mathcal{D}},\mathcal{Z})\leq \min_{\mathcal{D}}\mathrm{err}_p(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{Z})+\delta$ (for $p=1,2,\infty$) where the minimum is taken over all discrete distributions.We also establish conditional lower bounds, which strongly indicate the infeasibility of relative approximations as well as removal of the exponential dependency on the dimension for additive approximations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This suggests that significant improvements to our algorithm are unlikely. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>Purpose: Body composition measurements from routine abdominal CT can yield personalized risk assessments for asymptomatic and diseased patients.In particular, attenuation and volume measures of muscle and fat are associated with important clinical outcomes, such as cardiovascular events, fractures, and death.This study evaluates the reliability of an Internal tool for the segmentation of muscle and fat (subcutaneous and visceral) as compared to the well-established public TotalSegmentator tool.   Methods: We assessed the tools across 900 CT series from the publicly available SAROS dataset, focusing on muscle, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat.The Dice score was employed to assess accuracy in subcutaneous fat and muscle segmentation.Due to the lack of ground truth segmentations for visceral fat, Cohen's Kappa was utilized to assess segmentation agreement between the tools.   Results:Our Internal tool achieved a 3% higher Dice (83.8 vs. 80.8) for subcutaneous fat and a 5% improvement (87.6 vs. 83.2) for muscle segmentation respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that our results were statistically different with p<0.01. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>For visceral fat, the Cohen's kappa score of 0.856 indicated near-perfect agreement between the two tools.Our internal tool also showed very strong correlations for muscle volume (R^2=0.99), muscle attenuation (R^2=0.93), and subcutaneous fat volume (R^2=0.99) with a moderate correlation for subcutaneous fat attenuation (R^2=0.45).   Conclusion: Our findings indicated that our Internal tool outperformed TotalSegmentator in measuring subcutaneous fat and muscle.The high Cohen's Kappa score for visceral fat suggests a reliable level of agreement between the two tools.These results demonstrate the potential of our tool in advancing the accuracy of body composition analysis.</p>

                  <p>Existing photorealistic relightable hand models require extensive identity-specific observations in different views, poses, and illuminations, and face challenges in generalizing to natural illuminations and novel identities.To bridge this gap, we present URHand, the first universal relightable hand model that generalizes across viewpoints, poses, illuminations, and identities.Our model allows few-shot personalization using images captured with a mobile phone, and is ready to be photorealistically rendered under novel illuminations.To simplify the personalization process while retaining photorealism, we build a powerful universal relightable prior based on neural relighting from multi-view images of hands captured in a light stage with hundreds of identities.The key challenge is scaling the cross-identity training while maintaining personalized fidelity and sharp details without compromising generalization under natural illuminations.To this end, we propose a spatially varying linear lighting model as the neural renderer that takes physics-inspired shading as input feature.By removing non-linear activations and bias, our specifically designed lighting model explicitly keeps the linearity of light transport.This enables single-stage training from light-stage data while generalizing to real-time rendering under arbitrary continuous illuminations across diverse identities.In addition, we introduce the joint learning of a physically based model and our neural relighting model, which further improves fidelity and generalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of both quality and generalizability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>We also demonstrate quick personalization of URHand from a short phone scan of an unseen identity.</p>

                  <p>The objective of sign language recognition is to bridge the communication gap between the deaf and the hearing.Numerous previous works train their models using the well-established connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss.During the inference stage, the CTC-based models typically take the entire sign video as input to make predictions.This type of inference scheme is referred to as offline recognition.In contrast, while mature speech recognition systems can efficiently recognize spoken words on the fly, sign language recognition still falls short due to the lack of practical online solutions.In this work, we take the first step towards filling this gap.Our approach comprises three phases: 1) developing a sign language dictionary encompassing all glosses present in a target sign language dataset; 2) training an isolated sign language recognition model on augmented signs using both conventional classification loss and our novel saliency loss; 3) employing a sliding window approach on the input sign sequence and feeding each sign clip to the well-optimized model for online recognition.Furthermore, our online recognition model can be extended to boost the performance of any offline model, and to support online translation by appending a gloss-to-text network onto the recognition model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By integrating our online framework with the previously best-performing offline model, TwoStream-SLR, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks: Phoenix-2014, Phoenix-2014T, and CSL-Daily. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Code and models will be available at https://github.com/FangyunWei/SLRT</p>

                  <p>Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., Mamba, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding.In this paper, we show that the reliance of visual representation learning on self-attention is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models.On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation & memory efficiency.For example, Vim is 2.8$\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\times$1248.The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation & memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to become the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.Code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/Vim.</p>

                  <p>Despite the continued research and progress in building secure systems, Android applications continue to be ridden with vulnerabilities, necessitating effective detection methods.Current strategies involving static and dynamic analysis tools come with limitations like overwhelming number of false positives and limited scope of analysis which make either difficult to adopt.Over the past years, machine learning based approaches have been extensively explored for vulnerability detection, but its real-world applicability is constrained by data requirements and feature engineering challenges.Large Language Models (LLMs), with their vast parameters, have shown tremendous potential in understanding semnatics in human as well as programming languages.We dive into the efficacy of LLMs for detecting vulnerabilities in the context of Android security.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We focus on building an AI-driven workflow to assist developers in identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Our experiments show that LLMs outperform our expectations in finding issues within applications correctly flagging insecure apps in 91.67% of cases in the Ghera benchmark.We use inferences from our experiments towards building a robust and actionable vulnerability detection system and demonstrate its effectiveness.Our experiments also shed light on how different various simple configurations can affect the True Positive (TP) and False Positive (FP) rates.</p>

We build upon the recommender that has been in production since 2018, RevRecV1.We found that reviewers were being assigned based on prior authorship of files.We reviewed the literature for successful features and experimented with them with RevRecV2 in production.The most important feature in our new model was the familiarity of the author and reviewer, we saw an overall improvement in accuracy of 14 percentage points.   Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

We conduct historical analyses to understand the natural concentration of review workload and the degree of knowledge spreading that is inherent in code review.Even though review workload is highly concentrated, we show that code review natural spreads knowledge thereby reducing the files at risk to turnover.   Using simulation, we evaluate existing code review recommenders and develop novel recommenders to understand their impact on the level of expertise during review, the workload of reviewers, and the files at risk to turnover.Our simulations use seeded random replacement of reviewers to allow us to compare the reviewer recommenders without the confounding variation of different reviewers being replaced for each recommender.   Combining recommenders, we develop the SofiaWL recommender that suggests experts with low active review workload when none of the files under review are known by only one developer.In contrast, when knowledge is concentrated on one developer, it sends the review to other reviewers to spread knowledge.For the projects we study, we are able to globally increase expertise during reviews, +3%, reduce workload concentration, -12%, and reduce the files at risk, -28%.We make our scripts and data available in our replication package.Developers can optimize for a particular outcome measure based on the needs of their project, or use our GitHub bot to automatically balance the outcomes.</p>
