                  <p>Data contamination in language model evaluation is increasingly prevalent as the popularity of large language models.It allows models to "cheat" via memorisation instead of displaying true capabilities.Therefore, contamination analysis has became an crucial part of reliable model evaluation to validate results.However, existing contamination analysis is usually conducted internally by LLM developers and often lacks transparency and completeness.This paper present an open source data contamination reports for the Llama series models.We analyse six popular multi-choice QA benchmarks and quantify their overlapping with the training set of Llama.Various levels of contamination ranging from 1\% to 8.7\% are found across benchmarks.Our comparison also reveals that Llama models can gain over 5\% higher accuracy on contaminated subsets versus clean subsets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data and code are available at: https://github.com/liyucheng09/Contamination_Detector. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scene synthesis is a challenging problem with several industrial applications.Recently, substantial efforts have been directed to synthesize the scene using human motions, room layouts, or spatial graphs as the input.However, few studies have addressed this problem from multiple modalities, especially combining text prompts.In this paper, we propose a language-driven scene synthesis task, which is a new task that integrates text prompts, human motion, and existing objects for scene synthesis.Unlike other single-condition synthesis tasks, our problem involves multiple conditions and requires a strategy for processing and encoding them into a unified space.To address the challenge, we present a multi-conditional diffusion model, which differs from the implicit unification approach of other diffusion literature by explicitly predicting the guiding points for the original data distribution.We demonstrate that our approach is theoretically supportive.The intensive experiment results illustrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks and enables natural scene editing applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and dataset can be accessed at https://lang-scene-synth.github.io/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.901</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously data-inefficient, which makes training on a real robot difficult.While model-based RL algorithms (world models) improve data-efficiency to some extent, they still require hours or days of interaction to learn skills.Recently, offline RL has been proposed as a framework for training RL policies on pre-existing datasets without any online interaction.However, constraining an algorithm to a fixed dataset induces a state-action distribution shift between training and inference, and limits its applicability to new tasks.In this work, we seek to get the best of both worlds: we consider the problem of pretraining a world model with offline data collected on a real robot, and then finetuning the model on online data collected by planning with the learned model.To mitigate extrapolation errors during online interaction, we propose to regularize the planner at test-time by balancing estimated returns and (epistemic) model uncertainty.We evaluate our method on a variety of visuo-motor control tasks in simulation and on a real robot, and find that our method enables few-shot finetuning to seen and unseen tasks even when offline data is limited.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Videos, code, and data are available at https://yunhaifeng.com/FOWM . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved promising zero-shot accuracy on visual question answering (VQA) -- a fundamental task affecting various downstream applications and domains.Given the great potential for the broad use of these models, it is important to investigate their limitations in dealing with different image and question properties.In this work, we investigate whether multimodal LLMs can perceive small details as well as large details in images.In particular, we show that their zero-shot accuracy in answering visual questions is very sensitive to the size of the visual subject of the question, declining up to $46\%$ with size.Furthermore, we show that this effect is causal by observing that human visual cropping can significantly mitigate their sensitivity to size.Inspired by the usefulness of human cropping, we then propose three automatic visual cropping methods as inference time mechanisms to improve the zero-shot performance of multimodal LLMs.We study their effectiveness on four popular VQA datasets, and a subset of the VQAv2 dataset tailored towards fine visual details.Our findings suggest that multimodal LLMs should be used with caution in detail-sensitive VQA applications, and that visual cropping is a promising direction to improve their zero-shot performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) is a promising research paradigm that enables the collaborative training of machine learning models among various parties without the need for sensitive information exchange.Nonetheless, retaining data in individual clients introduces fundamental challenges to achieving performance on par with centrally trained models.Our study provides an extensive review of federated learning applied to visual recognition.It underscores the critical role of thoughtful architectural design choices in achieving optimal performance, a factor often neglected in the FL literature.Many existing FL solutions are tested on shallow or simple networks, which may not accurately reflect real-world applications.This practice restricts the transferability of research findings to large-scale visual recognition models.Through an in-depth analysis of diverse cutting-edge architectures such as convolutional neural networks, transformers, and MLP-mixers, we experimentally demonstrate that architectural choices can substantially enhance FL systems' performance, particularly when handling heterogeneous data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We study 19 visual recognition models from five different architectural families on four challenging FL datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>We also re-investigate the inferior performance of convolution-based architectures in the FL setting and analyze the influence of normalization layers on the FL performance.Our findings emphasize the importance of architectural design for computer vision tasks in practical scenarios, effectively narrowing the performance gap between federated and centralized learning.Our source code is available at https://github.com/sarapieri/fed_het.git.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen significant growth over the past few years.Despite this, there has been little work on generating diagrams with T2I models.A diagram is a symbolic/schematic representation that explains information using structurally rich and spatially complex visualizations (e.g., a dense combination of related objects, text labels, directional arrows, connection lines, etc.).Existing state-of-the-art T2I models often fail at diagram generation because they lack fine-grained object layout control when many objects are densely connected via complex relations such as arrows/lines and also often fail to render comprehensible text labels.To address this gap, we present DiagrammerGPT, a novel two-stage text-to-diagram generation framework that leverages the layout guidance capabilities of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to generate more accurate open-domain, open-platform diagrams.In the first stage, we use LLMs to generate and iteratively refine 'diagram plans' (in a planner-auditor feedback loop) which describe all the entities (objects and text labels), their relationships (arrows or lines), and their bounding box layouts.In the second stage, we use a diagram generator, DiagramGLIGEN, and a text label rendering module to generate diagrams following the diagram plans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To benchmark the text-to-diagram generation task, we introduce AI2D-Caption, a densely annotated diagram dataset built on top of the AI2D dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.803</span></span>We show quantitatively and qualitatively that our DiagrammerGPT framework produces more accurate diagrams, outperforming existing T2I models.We also provide comprehensive analysis including open-domain diagram generation, vector graphic diagram generation in different platforms, human-in-the-loop diagram plan editing, and multimodal planner/auditor LLMs (e.g., GPT-4Vision).We hope our work can inspire further research on diagram generation via T2I models and LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Detection of anomalous events in videos is an important problem in applications such as surveillance.Video anomaly detection (VAD) is well-studied in the one-class classification (OCC) and weakly supervised (WS) settings.However, fully unsupervised (US) video anomaly detection methods, which learn a complete system without any annotation or human supervision, have not been explored in depth.This is because the lack of any ground truth annotations significantly increases the magnitude of the VAD challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this challenge, we propose a simple-but-effective two-stage pseudo-label generation framework that produces segment-level (normal/anomaly) pseudo-labels, which can be further used to train a segment-level anomaly detector in a supervised manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>The proposed coarse-to-fine pseudo-label (C2FPL) generator employs carefully-designed hierarchical divisive clustering and statistical hypothesis testing to identify anomalous video segments from a set of completely unlabeled videos.The trained anomaly detector can be directly applied on segments of an unseen test video to obtain segment-level, and subsequently, frame-level anomaly predictions.Extensive studies on two large-scale public-domain datasets, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised approach achieves superior performance compared to all existing OCC and US methods , while yielding comparable performance to the state-of-the-art WS methods.</p>

This paper proposes an automatic approach using the BART algorithm, a state-of-the-art transformer model, to generate summaries for APIs discussed in StackOverflow.We built an oracle of human-generated summaries to evaluate our approach against it using ROUGE and BLEU metrics which are the most widely used evaluation metrics in text summarization.Furthermore, we evaluated our summaries empirically against a previous work in terms of quality.Our findings demonstrate that using deep learning algorithms can improve summaries' quality and outperform the previous work by an average of %57 for Precision, %66 for Recall, and %61 for F-measure, and it runs 4.4 times faster.</p>
