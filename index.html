                  <p>Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems aim to achieve specific goals through interactive dialogue.Such tasks usually involve following specific workflows, i.e. executing a sequence of actions in a particular order.While prior work has focused on supervised learning methods to condition on past actions, they do not explicitly optimize for compliance to a desired workflow.In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) to generate dialogue responses that are aligned with a given workflow.Our framework consists of ComplianceScorer, a metric designed to evaluate how well a generated response executes the specified action, combined with an RL opimization process that utilizes an interactive sampling technique.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach on two TOD datasets, Action-Based Conversations Dataset (ABCD) (Chen et al., 2021a) and MultiWOZ 2.2 (Zang et al., 2020) on a range of automated and human evaluation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>Our findings indicate that our RL-based framework outperforms baselines and is effective at enerating responses that both comply with the intended workflows while being expressed in a natural and fluent manner.</p>

                  <p>Context: An assurance case is a structured hierarchy of claims aiming at demonstrating that a given mission-critical system supports specific requirements (e.g., safety, security, privacy).The presence of assurance weakeners (i.e., assurance deficits, logical fallacies) in assurance cases reflects insufficient evidence, knowledge, or gaps in reasoning.These weakeners can undermine confidence in assurance arguments, potentially hindering the verification of mission-critical system capabilities.   Objectives:As a stepping stone for future research on assurance weakeners, we aim to initiate the first comprehensive systematic mapping study on this subject.Methods: We followed the well-established PRISMA 2020 and SEGRESS guidelines to conduct our systematic mapping study.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We searched for primary studies in five digital libraries and focused on the 2012-2023 publication year range. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>Our selection criteria focused on studies addressing assurance weakeners at the modeling level, resulting in the inclusion of 39 primary studies in our systematic review.   Results: Our systematic mapping study reports a taxonomy (map) that provides a uniform categorization of assurance weakeners and approaches proposed to manage them at the modeling level.   Conclusion: Our study findings suggest that the SACM (Structured Assurance Case Metamodel) -- a standard specified by the OMG (Object Management Group) -- may be the best specification to capture structured arguments and reason about their potential assurance weakeners.</p>

                  <p>Are Large language models (LLMs) temporally grounded?Since LLMs cannot perceive and interact with the environment, it is impossible to answer this question directly.Instead, we provide LLMs with textual narratives and probe them with respect to their common-sense knowledge of the structure and duration of events, their ability to order events along a timeline, and self-consistency within their temporal model (e.g., temporal relations such as after and before are mutually exclusive for any pair of events).We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs (such as LLaMA 2 and GPT-4) on three tasks reflecting these abilities.Generally, we find that LLMs lag significantly behind both human performance as well as small-scale, specialised LMs.In-context learning, instruction tuning, and chain-of-thought prompting reduce this gap only to a limited degree.Crucially, LLMs struggle the most with self-consistency, displaying incoherent behaviour in at least 27.23% of their predictions.Contrary to expectations, we also find that scaling the model size does not guarantee positive gains in performance.To explain these results, we study the sources from which LLMs may gather temporal information: we find that sentence ordering in unlabelled texts, available during pre-training, is only weakly correlated with event ordering.Moreover, public instruction tuning mixtures contain few temporal tasks.Hence, we conclude that current LLMs lack a consistent temporal model of textual narratives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, datasets, and LLM outputs are available at https://github.com/yfqiu-nlp/temporal-llms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D content creation via text-driven stylization has played a fundamental challenge to multimedia and graphics community.Recent advances of cross-modal foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have made this problem feasible.Those approaches commonly leverage CLIP to align the holistic semantics of stylized mesh with the given text prompt.Nevertheless, it is not trivial to enable more controllable stylization of fine-grained details in 3D meshes solely based on such semantic-level cross-modal supervision.In this work, we propose a new 3DStyle-Diffusion model that triggers fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes with additional controllable appearance and geometric guidance from 2D Diffusion models.Technically, 3DStyle-Diffusion first parameterizes the texture of 3D mesh into reflectance properties and scene lighting using implicit MLP networks.Meanwhile, an accurate depth map of each sampled view is achieved conditioned on 3D mesh.Then, 3DStyle-Diffusion leverages a pre-trained controllable 2D Diffusion model to guide the learning of rendered images, encouraging the synthesized image of each view semantically aligned with text prompt and geometrically consistent with depth map.This way elegantly integrates both image rendering via implicit MLP networks and diffusion process of image synthesis in an end-to-end fashion, enabling a high-quality fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also build a new dataset derived from Objaverse and the evaluation protocol for this task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we validate the capability of our 3DStyle-Diffusion.Source code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/yanghb22-fdu/3DStyle-Diffusion-Official}.</p>

                  <p>Emotions play a significant role in teamwork and collaborative activities like software development.While researchers have analyzed developer emotions in various software artifacts (e.g., issues, pull requests), few studies have focused on understanding the broad spectrum of emotions expressed in chats.As one of the most widely used means of communication, chats contain valuable information in the form of informal conversations, such as negative perspectives about adopting a tool.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present a dataset of developer chat messages manually annotated with a wide range of emotion labels (and sub-labels), and analyze the type of information present in those messages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span>We also investigate the unique signals of emotions specific to chats and distinguish them from other forms of software communication.Our findings suggest that chats have fewer expressions of Approval and Fear but more expressions of Curiosity compared to GitHub comments.We also notice that Confusion is frequently observed when discussing programming-related information such as unexpected software behavior.Overall, our study highlights the potential of mining emotions in developer chats for supporting software maintenance and evolution tools.</p>

                  <p>Recently proposed long-form question answering (QA) systems, supported by large language models (LLMs), have shown promising capabilities.Yet, attributing and verifying their generated abstractive answers can be difficult, and automatically evaluating their accuracy remains an ongoing challenge.   In this work, we introduce a new QA task for answering multi-answer questions by summarizing multiple diverse sources in a semi-extractive fashion.Specifically, Semi-extractive Multi-source QA (SEMQA) requires models to output a comprehensive answer, while mixing factual quoted spans -- copied verbatim from given input sources -- and non-factual free-text connectors that glue these spans together into a single cohesive passage.This setting bridges the gap between the outputs of well-grounded but constrained extractive QA systems and more fluent but harder to attribute fully abstractive answers.Particularly, it enables a new mode for language models that leverages their advanced language generation capabilities, while also producing fine in-line attributions by-design that are easy to verify, interpret, and evaluate.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To study this task, we create the first dataset of this kind, QuoteSum, with human-written semi-extractive answers to natural and generated questions, and define text-based evaluation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span>Experimenting with several LLMs in various settings, we find this task to be surprisingly challenging, demonstrating the importance of QuoteSum for developing and studying such consolidation capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Recently, pretrained language models have shown state-of-the-art performance on the vulnerability detection task.These models are pretrained on a large corpus of source code, then fine-tuned on a smaller supervised vulnerability dataset.Due to the different training objectives and the performance of the models, it is interesting to consider whether the models have learned the semantics of code relevant to vulnerability detection, namely bug semantics, and if so, how the alignment to bug semantics relates to model performance.In this paper, we analyze the models using three distinct methods: interpretability tools, attention analysis, and interaction matrix analysis.We compare the models' influential feature sets with the bug semantic features which define the causes of bugs, including buggy paths and Potentially Vulnerable Statements (PVS).We find that (1) better-performing models also aligned better with PVS, (2) the models failed to align strongly to PVS, and (3) the models failed to align at all to buggy paths.Based on our analysis, we developed two annotation methods which highlight the bug semantics inside the model's inputs.We evaluated our approach on four distinct transformer models and four vulnerability datasets and found that our annotations improved the models' performance in the majority of settings - 11 out of 16, with up to 9.57 points improvement in F1 score compared to conventional fine-tuning.We further found that with our annotations, the models aligned up to 232% better to potentially vulnerable statements.Our findings indicate that it is helpful to provide the model with information of the bug semantics, that the model can attend to it, and motivate future work in learning more complex path-based bug semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at https://figshare.com/s/4a16a528d6874aad51a0. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span></p>

                  <p>In natural language processing (NLP), lexical function is a concept to unambiguously represent semantic and syntactic features of words and phrases in text first crafted in the Meaning-Text Theory.Hierarchical classification of lexical functions involves organizing these features into a tree-like hierarchy of categories or labels.This is a challenging task as it requires a good understanding of the context and the relationships among words and phrases in text.It also needs large amounts of labeled data to train language models effectively.In this paper, we present a dataset of most frequent Spanish verb-noun collocations and sentences where they occur, each collocation is assigned to one of 37 lexical functions defined as classes for a hierarchical classification task.Each class represents a relation between the noun and the verb in a collocation involving their semantic and syntactic features.We combine the classes in a tree-based structure, and introduce classification objectives for each level of the structure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset was created by dependency tree parsing and matching of the phrases in Spanish news. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.795</span></span>We provide baselines and data splits for each objective.</p>

                  <p>Personal sensing, leveraging data passively and near-continuously collected with wearables from patients in their ecological environment, is a promising paradigm to monitor mood disorders (MDs), a major determinant of worldwide disease burden.However, collecting and annotating wearable data is very resource-intensive.Studies of this kind can thus typically afford to recruit only a couple dozens of patients.This constitutes one of the major obstacles to applying modern supervised machine learning techniques to MDs detection.In this paper, we overcome this data bottleneck and advance the detection of MDs acute episode vs stable state from wearables data on the back of recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL).This leverages unlabelled data to learn representations during pre-training, subsequently exploited for a supervised task.First, we collected open-access datasets recording with an Empatica E4 spanning different, unrelated to MD monitoring, personal sensing tasks -- from emotion recognition in Super Mario players to stress detection in undergraduates -- and devised a pre-processing pipeline performing on-/off-body detection, sleep-wake detection, segmentation, and (optionally) feature extraction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With 161 E4-recorded subjects, we introduce E4SelfLearning, the largest to date open access collection, and its pre-processing pipeline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>Second, we show that SSL confidently outperforms fully-supervised pipelines using either our novel E4-tailored Transformer architecture (E4mer) or classical baseline XGBoost: 81.23% against 75.35% (E4mer) and 72.02% (XGBoost) correctly classified recording segments from 64 (half acute, half stable) patients.Lastly, we illustrate that SSL performance is strongly associated with the specific surrogate task employed for pre-training as well as with unlabelled data availability.</p>

                  <p>Robust perception is a vital component for ensuring safe autonomous and assisted driving.Automotive radar (77 to 81 GHz), which offers weather-resilient sensing, provides a complementary capability to the vision- or LiDAR-based autonomous driving systems.Raw radio-frequency (RF) radar tensors contain rich spatiotemporal semantics besides 3D location information.The majority of previous methods take in 3D (Doppler-range-azimuth) RF radar tensors, allowing prediction of an object's location, heading angle, and size in bird's-eye-view (BEV).However, they lack the ability to at the same time infer objects' size, orientation, and identity in the 3D space.To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient joint architecture called CenterRadarNet, designed to facilitate high-resolution representation learning from 4D (Doppler-range-azimuth-elevation) radar data for 3D object detection and re-identification (re-ID) tasks.As a single-stage 3D object detector, CenterRadarNet directly infers the BEV object distribution confidence maps, corresponding 3D bounding box attributes, and appearance embedding for each pixel.Moreover, we build an online tracker utilizing the learned appearance embedding for re-ID. CenterRadarNetachieves the state-of-the-art result on the K-Radar 3D object detection benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we present the first 3D object-tracking result using radar on the K-Radar dataset V2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>In diverse driving scenarios, CenterRadarNet shows consistent, robust performance, emphasizing its wide applicability.</p>

                  <p>Intensive Care Units (ICU) provide close supervision and continuous care to patients with life-threatening conditions.However, continuous patient assessment in the ICU is still limited due to time constraints and the workload on healthcare providers.Existing patient assessments in the ICU such as pain or mobility assessment are mostly sporadic and administered manually, thus introducing the potential for human errors.Developing Artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can augment human assessments in the ICU can be beneficial for providing more objective and granular monitoring capabilities.For example, capturing the variations in a patient's facial cues related to pain or agitation can help in adjusting pain-related medications or detecting agitation-inducing conditions such as delirium.Additionally, subtle changes in visual cues during or prior to adverse clinical events could potentially aid in continuous patient monitoring when combined with high-resolution physiological signals and Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.In this paper, we examined the association between visual cues and patient condition including acuity status, acute brain dysfunction, and pain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We leveraged our AU-ICU dataset with 107,064 frames collected in the ICU annotated with facial action units (AUs) labels by trained annotators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>We developed a new "masked loss computation" technique that addresses the data imbalance problem by maximizing data resource utilization.We trained the model using our AU-ICU dataset in conjunction with three external datasets to detect 18 AUs.The SWIN Transformer model achieved 0.57 mean F1-score and 0.89 mean accuracy on the test set.Additionally, we performed AU inference on 634,054 frames to evaluate the association between facial AUs and clinically important patient conditions such as acuity status, acute brain dysfunction, and pain.</p>

                  <p>Recently, pretrained language models have shown state-of-the-art performance on the vulnerability detection task.These models are pretrained on a large corpus of source code, then fine-tuned on a smaller supervised vulnerability dataset.Due to the different training objectives and the performance of the models, it is interesting to consider whether the models have learned the semantics of code relevant to vulnerability detection, namely bug semantics, and if so, how the alignment to bug semantics relates to model performance.In this paper, we analyze the models using three distinct methods: interpretability tools, attention analysis, and interaction matrix analysis.We compare the models' influential feature sets with the bug semantic features which define the causes of bugs, including buggy paths and Potentially Vulnerable Statements (PVS).We find that (1) better-performing models also aligned better with PVS, (2) the models failed to align strongly to PVS, and (3) the models failed to align at all to buggy paths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on our analysis, we developed two annotation methods which highlight the bug semantics inside the model's inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>We evaluated our approach on four distinct transformer models and four vulnerability datasets and found that our annotations improved the models' performance in the majority of settings - 11 out of 16, with up to 9.57 points improvement in F1 score compared to conventional fine-tuning.We further found that with our annotations, the models aligned up to 232% better to potentially vulnerable statements.Our findings indicate that it is helpful to provide the model with information of the bug semantics, that the model can attend to it, and motivate future work in learning more complex path-based bug semantics.Our code and data are available at https://figshare.com/s/4a16a528d6874aad51a0.</p>

                  <p>Explainable AI (XAI) has been proposed as a valuable tool to assist in downstream tasks involving human and AI collaboration.Perhaps the most psychologically valid XAI techniques are case based approaches which display 'whole' exemplars to explain the predictions of black box AI systems.However, for such post hoc XAI methods dealing with images, there has been no attempt to improve their scope by using multiple clear feature 'parts' of the images to explain the predictions while linking back to relevant cases in the training data, thus allowing for more comprehensive explanations that are faithful to the underlying model.Here, we address this gap by proposing two general algorithms (latent and super pixel based) which can isolate multiple clear feature parts in a test image, and then connect them to the explanatory cases found in the training data, before testing their effectiveness in a carefully designed user study.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results demonstrate that the proposed approach appropriately calibrates a users feelings of 'correctness' for ambiguous classifications in real world data on the ImageNet dataset, an effect which does not happen when just showing the explanation without feature highlighting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text-based Person Search (TBPS) aims to retrieve images of target pedestrian indicated by textual descriptions.It is essential for TBPS to extract fine-grained local features and align them crossing modality.Existing methods utilize external tools or heavy cross-modal interaction to achieve explicit alignment of cross-modal fine-grained features, which is inefficient and time-consuming.In this work, we propose a Vision-Guided Semantic-Group Network (VGSG) for text-based person search to extract well-aligned fine-grained visual and textual features.In the proposed VGSG, we develop a Semantic-Group Textual Learning (SGTL) module and a Vision-guided Knowledge Transfer (VGKT) module to extract textual local features under the guidance of visual local clues.In SGTL, in order to obtain the local textual representation, we group textual features from the channel dimension based on the semantic cues of language expression, which encourages similar semantic patterns to be grouped implicitly without external tools.In VGKT, a vision-guided attention is employed to extract visual-related textual features, which are inherently aligned with visual cues and termed vision-guided textual features.Furthermore, we design a relational knowledge transfer, including a vision-language similarity transfer and a class probability transfer, to adaptively propagate information of the vision-guided textual features to semantic-group textual features.With the help of relational knowledge transfer, VGKT is capable of aligning semantic-group textual features with corresponding visual features without external tools and complex pairwise interaction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current approaches for collision avoidance and space traffic management face many challenges, mainly due to the continuous increase in the number of objects in orbit and the lack of scalable and automated solutions.To avoid catastrophic incidents, satellite owners/operators must be aware of their assets' collision risk to decide whether a collision avoidance manoeuvre needs to be performed.This process is typically executed through the use of warnings issued in the form of CDMs which contain information about the event, such as the expected TCA and the probability of collision.Our previous work presented a statistical learning model that allowed us to answer two important questions: (1) Will any new conjunctions be issued in the next specified time interval?(2) When and with what uncertainty will the next CDM arrive?However, the model was based on an empirical Bayes homogeneous Poisson process, which assumes that the arrival rates of CDMs are constant over time.In fact, the rate at which the CDMs are issued depends on the behaviour of the objects as well as on the screening process performed by third parties.Thus, in this work, we extend the previous study and propose a Bayesian non-homogeneous Poisson process implemented with high precision using a Probabilistic Programming Language to fully describe the underlying phenomena.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare the proposed solution with a baseline model to demonstrate the added value of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>The results show that this problem can be successfully modelled by our Bayesian non-homogeneous Poisson Process with greater accuracy, contributing to the development of automated collision avoidance systems and helping operators react timely but sparingly with satellite manoeuvres.</p>

                  <p>Mixup refers to interpolation-based data augmentation, originally motivated as a way to go beyond empirical risk minimization (ERM).Its extensions mostly focus on the definition of interpolation and the space (input or feature) where it takes place, while the augmentation process itself is less studied.In most methods, the number of generated examples is limited to the mini-batch size and the number of examples being interpolated is limited to two (pairs), in the input space.   We make progress in this direction by introducing MultiMix, which generates an arbitrarily large number of interpolated examples beyond the mini-batch size and interpolates the entire mini-batch in the embedding space.Effectively, we sample on the entire convex hull of the mini-batch rather than along linear segments between pairs of examples.   On sequence data, we further extend to Dense MultiMix.We densely interpolate features and target labels at each spatial location and also apply the loss densely.To mitigate the lack of dense labels, we inherit labels from examples and weight interpolation factors by attention as a measure of confidence.   Overall, we increase the number of loss terms per mini-batch by orders of magnitude at little additional cost.This is only possible because of interpolating in the embedding space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We empirically show that our solutions yield significant improvement over state-of-the-art mixup methods on four different benchmarks, despite interpolation being only linear. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>By analyzing the embedding space, we show that the classes are more tightly clustered and uniformly spread over the embedding space, thereby explaining the improved behavior.</p>

                  <p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have risen to prominence in the field of deep learning, facilitating the generation of realistic data from random noise.The effectiveness of GANs often depends on the quality of feature extraction, a critical aspect of their architecture.This paper introduces L-WaveBlock, a novel and robust feature extractor that leverages the capabilities of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with deep learning methodologies.L-WaveBlock is catered to quicken the convergence of GAN generators while simultaneously enhancing their performance.The paper demonstrates the remarkable utility of L-WaveBlock across three datasets, a road satellite imagery dataset, the CelebA dataset and the GoPro dataset, showcasing its ability to ease feature extraction and make it more efficient.By utilizing DWT, L-WaveBlock efficiently captures the intricate details of both structural and textural details, and further partitions feature maps into orthogonal subbands across multiple scales while preserving essential information at the same time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Not only does it lead to faster convergence, but also gives competent results on every dataset by employing the L-WaveBlock. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>The proposed method achieves an Inception Score of 3.6959 and a Structural Similarity Index of 0.4261 on the maps dataset, a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio of 29.05 and a Structural Similarity Index of 0.874 on the CelebA dataset.The proposed method performs competently to the state-of-the-art for the image denoising dataset, albeit not better, but still leads to faster convergence than conventional methods.With this, L-WaveBlock emerges as a robust and efficient tool for enhancing GAN-based image generation, demonstrating superior convergence speed and competitive performance across multiple datasets for image resolution, image generation and image denoising.</p>

                  <p>Identifying root causes for unexpected or undesirable behavior in complex systems is a prevalent challenge.This issue becomes especially crucial in modern cloud applications that employ numerous microservices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although the machine learning and systems research communities have proposed various techniques to tackle this problem, there is currently a lack of standardized datasets for quantitative benchmarking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Consequently, research groups are compelled to create their own datasets for experimentation.This paper introduces a dataset specifically designed for evaluating root cause analyses in microservice-based applications.The dataset encompasses latency, requests, and availability metrics emitted in 5-minute intervals from a distributed application.In addition to normal operation metrics, the dataset includes 68 injected performance issues, which increase latency and reduce availability throughout the system.We showcase how this dataset can be used to evaluate the accuracy of a variety of methods spanning different causal and non-causal characterisations of the root cause analysis problem.We hope the new dataset, available at https://github.com/amazon-science/petshop-root-cause-analysis/ enables further development of techniques in this important area.</p>

                  <p>Tucker decomposition is a powerful tensor model to handle multi-aspect data.It demonstrates the low-rank property by decomposing the grid-structured data as interactions between a core tensor and a set of object representations (factors).A fundamental assumption of such decomposition is that there were finite objects in each aspect or mode, corresponding to discrete indexes of data entries.However, many real-world data are not naturally posed in the setting.For example, geographic data is represented as continuous indexes of latitude and longitude coordinates, and cannot fit tensor models directly.To generalize Tucker decomposition to such scenarios, we propose Functional Bayesian Tucker Decomposition (FunBaT).We treat the continuous-indexed data as the interaction between the Tucker core and a group of latent functions.We use Gaussian processes (GP) as functional priors to model the latent functions, and then convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE) to reduce computational cost.An efficient inference algorithm is further developed for scalable posterior approximation based on advanced message-passing techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The advantage of our method is shown in both synthetic data and several real-world applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>In contrast to regular (simple) networks, hyper networks possess the ability to depict more complex relationships among nodes and store extensive information.Such networks are commonly found in real-world applications, such as in social interactions.Learning embedded representations for nodes involves a process that translates network structures into more simplified spaces, thereby enabling the application of machine learning approaches designed for vector data to be extended to network data.Nevertheless, there remains a need to delve into methods for learning embedded representations that prioritize structural aspects.This research introduces HyperS2V, a node embedding approach that centers on the structural similarity within hyper networks.Initially, we establish the concept of hyper-degrees to capture the structural properties of nodes within hyper networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, a novel function is formulated to measure the structural similarity between different hyper-degree values. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Lastly, we generate structural embeddings utilizing a multi-scale random walk framework.Moreover, a series of experiments, both intrinsic and extrinsic, are performed on both toy and real networks.The results underscore the superior performance of HyperS2V in terms of both interpretability and applicability to downstream tasks.</p>

                  <p>Context: An assurance case is a structured hierarchy of claims aiming at demonstrating that a given mission-critical system supports specific requirements (e.g., safety, security, privacy).The presence of assurance weakeners (i.e., assurance deficits, logical fallacies) in assurance cases reflects insufficient evidence, knowledge, or gaps in reasoning.These weakeners can undermine confidence in assurance arguments, potentially hindering the verification of mission-critical system capabilities.   Objectives:As a stepping stone for future research on assurance weakeners, we aim to initiate the first comprehensive systematic mapping study on this subject.Methods: We followed the well-established PRISMA 2020 and SEGRESS guidelines to conduct our systematic mapping study.We searched for primary studies in five digital libraries and focused on the 2012-2023 publication year range.Our selection criteria focused on studies addressing assurance weakeners at the modeling level, resulting in the inclusion of 39 primary studies in our systematic review.   Results: Our systematic mapping study reports a taxonomy (map) that provides a uniform categorization of assurance weakeners and approaches proposed to manage them at the modeling level.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conclusion: Our study findings suggest that the SACM (Structured Assurance Case Metamodel) -- a standard specified by the OMG (Object Management Group) -- may be the best specification to capture structured arguments and reason about their potential assurance weakeners. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format designed for secure and efficient execution within sandboxed environments - predominantly web apps and browsers - to facilitate performance, security, and flexibility of web programming languages.In recent years, Wasm has gained significant attention from academic research community and industrial development projects to engineer high-performance web applications.Despite the offered benefits, developers encounter a multitude of issues rooted in Wasm (e.g., faults, errors, failures) and are often unaware of their root-causes that impact the development of web applications.Wasm developers require knowledge, documented as empirically rooted guidelines, patterns, documents etc., that help them to understand, analyse, and resolve the issues that currently lacks in existing research and practice.To this end, we conducted an empirical study that mines and documents practitioners' knowledge expressed as 385 issues from 12 open-source Wasm projects deployed on GitHub and 354 question-answer posts via Stack Overflow.Our study led to the first-of-its-kind taxonomies of issues faced by developers and their underlying causes in Wasm-based applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Issues faced by developers arise from 'Infrastructure, Integration and Compatibility Aspects' (28.16%), 'Language Features and Documentation Errors' (18.00%), along with 'Code Implementation and Build failures' (13.83%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>The results indicate that 'Syntactic and Semantic Errors' (25.77%), 'Configuration and Compatibility Constraints' (20.1%), and 'Operational Limitations' (12.98%) are the principal causes of these issues.The study provides a taxonomical classification of issues and their causes, offering empirically derived guidelines, that can inform researchers and developers to systematically design, develop, and refactor Wasm-based applications.</p>
