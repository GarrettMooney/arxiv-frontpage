                  <p>3D content creation via text-driven stylization has played a fundamental challenge to multimedia and graphics community.Recent advances of cross-modal foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have made this problem feasible.Those approaches commonly leverage CLIP to align the holistic semantics of stylized mesh with the given text prompt.Nevertheless, it is not trivial to enable more controllable stylization of fine-grained details in 3D meshes solely based on such semantic-level cross-modal supervision.In this work, we propose a new 3DStyle-Diffusion model that triggers fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes with additional controllable appearance and geometric guidance from 2D Diffusion models.Technically, 3DStyle-Diffusion first parameterizes the texture of 3D mesh into reflectance properties and scene lighting using implicit MLP networks.Meanwhile, an accurate depth map of each sampled view is achieved conditioned on 3D mesh.Then, 3DStyle-Diffusion leverages a pre-trained controllable 2D Diffusion model to guide the learning of rendered images, encouraging the synthesized image of each view semantically aligned with text prompt and geometrically consistent with depth map.This way elegantly integrates both image rendering via implicit MLP networks and diffusion process of image synthesis in an end-to-end fashion, enabling a high-quality fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also build a new dataset derived from Objaverse and the evaluation protocol for this task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we validate the capability of our 3DStyle-Diffusion.Source code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/yanghb22-fdu/3DStyle-Diffusion-Official}.</p>

In this work, we introduce a new QA task for answering multi-answer questions by summarizing multiple diverse sources in a semi-extractive fashion.Specifically, Semi-extractive Multi-source QA (SEMQA) requires models to output a comprehensive answer, while mixing factual quoted spans -- copied verbatim from given input sources -- and non-factual free-text connectors that glue these spans together into a single cohesive passage.This setting bridges the gap between the outputs of well-grounded but constrained extractive QA systems and more fluent but harder to attribute fully abstractive answers.Particularly, it enables a new mode for language models that leverages their advanced language generation capabilities, while also producing fine in-line attributions by-design that are easy to verify, interpret, and evaluate.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To study this task, we create the first dataset of this kind, QuoteSum, with human-written semi-extractive answers to natural and generated questions, and define text-based evaluation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span>Experimenting with several LLMs in various settings, we find this task to be surprisingly challenging, demonstrating the importance of QuoteSum for developing and studying such consolidation capabilities.</p>

                  <p>We present PD-REAL, a novel large-scale dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) in the 3D domain.It is motivated by the fact that 2D-only representations in the AD task may fail to capture the geometric structures of anomalies due to uncertainty in lighting conditions or shooting angles.PD-REAL consists entirely of Play-Doh models for 15 object categories and focuses on the analysis of potential benefits from 3D information in a controlled environment.Specifically, objects are first created with six types of anomalies, such as dent, crack, or perforation, and then photographed under different lighting conditions to mimic real-world inspection scenarios.To demonstrate the usefulness of 3D information, we use a commercially available RealSense camera to capture RGB and depth images.Compared to the existing 3D dataset for AD tasks, the data acquisition of PD-REAL is significantly cheaper, easily scalable and easier to control variables.Extensive evaluations with state-of-the-art AD algorithms on our dataset demonstrate the benefits as well as challenges of using 3D information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset can be downloaded from https://github.com/Andy-cs008/PD-REAL <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.92</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, pretrained language models have shown state-of-the-art performance on the vulnerability detection task.These models are pretrained on a large corpus of source code, then fine-tuned on a smaller supervised vulnerability dataset.Due to the different training objectives and the performance of the models, it is interesting to consider whether the models have learned the semantics of code relevant to vulnerability detection, namely bug semantics, and if so, how the alignment to bug semantics relates to model performance.In this paper, we analyze the models using three distinct methods: interpretability tools, attention analysis, and interaction matrix analysis.We compare the models' influential feature sets with the bug semantic features which define the causes of bugs, including buggy paths and Potentially Vulnerable Statements (PVS).We find that (1) better-performing models also aligned better with PVS, (2) the models failed to align strongly to PVS, and (3) the models failed to align at all to buggy paths.Based on our analysis, we developed two annotation methods which highlight the bug semantics inside the model's inputs.We evaluated our approach on four distinct transformer models and four vulnerability datasets and found that our annotations improved the models' performance in the majority of settings - 11 out of 16, with up to 9.57 points improvement in F1 score compared to conventional fine-tuning.We further found that with our annotations, the models aligned up to 232% better to potentially vulnerable statements.Our findings indicate that it is helpful to provide the model with information of the bug semantics, that the model can attend to it, and motivate future work in learning more complex path-based bug semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at https://figshare.com/s/4a16a528d6874aad51a0. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurate reconstruction of plant phenotypes plays a key role in optimising sustainable farming practices in the field of Precision Agriculture (PA).Currently, optical sensor-based approaches dominate the field, but the need for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction of crops and plants in unstructured agricultural environments remains challenging.Recently, a promising development has emerged in the form of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), a novel method that utilises neural density fields.This technique has shown impressive performance in various novel vision synthesis tasks, but has remained relatively unexplored in the agricultural context.In our study, we focus on two fundamental tasks within plant phenotyping: (1) the synthesis of 2D novel-view images and (2) the 3D reconstruction of crop and plant models.We explore the world of neural radiance fields, in particular two SOTA methods: Instant-NGP, which excels in generating high-quality images with impressive training and inference speed, and Instant-NSR, which improves the reconstructed geometry by incorporating the Signed Distance Function (SDF) during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, we present a novel plant phenotype dataset comprising real plant images from production environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>This dataset is a first-of-its-kind initiative aimed at comprehensively exploring the advantages and limitations of NeRF in agricultural contexts.Our experimental results show that NeRF demonstrates commendable performance in the synthesis of novel-view images and is able to achieve reconstruction results that are competitive with Reality Capture, a leading commercial software for 3D Multi-View Stereo (MVS)-based reconstruction.However, our study also highlights certain drawbacks of NeRF, including relatively slow training speeds, performance limitations in cases of insufficient sampling, and challenges in obtaining geometry quality in complex setups.</p>

                  <p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models to the vision domain.Initial efforts towards LMMs used holistic images and text prompts to generate ungrounded textual responses.Very recently, region-level LMMs have been used to generate visually grounded responses.However, they are limited to only referring a single object category at a time, require users to specify the regions in inputs, or cannot offer dense pixel-wise object grounding.In this work, we present Grounding LMM (GLaMM), the first model that can generate natural language responses seamlessly intertwined with corresponding object segmentation masks.GLaMM not only grounds objects appearing in the conversations but is flexible enough to accept both textual and optional visual prompts (region of interest) as input.This empowers users to interact with the model at various levels of granularity, both in textual and visual domains.Due to the lack of standard benchmarks for the novel setting of generating visually grounded detailed conversations, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol with our curated grounded conversations.Our proposed Grounded Conversation Generation (GCG) task requires densely grounded concepts in natural scenes at a large-scale.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we propose a densely annotated Grounding-anything Dataset (GranD) using our proposed automated annotation pipeline that encompasses 7.5M unique concepts grounded in a total of 810M regions available with segmentation masks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>Besides GCG, GLaMM also performs effectively on several downstream tasks e.g., referring expression segmentation, image and region-level captioning and vision-language conversations.Project Page: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/groundingLMM.</p>

                  <p>Robust perception is a vital component for ensuring safe autonomous and assisted driving.Automotive radar (77 to 81 GHz), which offers weather-resilient sensing, provides a complementary capability to the vision- or LiDAR-based autonomous driving systems.Raw radio-frequency (RF) radar tensors contain rich spatiotemporal semantics besides 3D location information.The majority of previous methods take in 3D (Doppler-range-azimuth) RF radar tensors, allowing prediction of an object's location, heading angle, and size in bird's-eye-view (BEV).However, they lack the ability to at the same time infer objects' size, orientation, and identity in the 3D space.To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient joint architecture called CenterRadarNet, designed to facilitate high-resolution representation learning from 4D (Doppler-range-azimuth-elevation) radar data for 3D object detection and re-identification (re-ID) tasks.As a single-stage 3D object detector, CenterRadarNet directly infers the BEV object distribution confidence maps, corresponding 3D bounding box attributes, and appearance embedding for each pixel.Moreover, we build an online tracker utilizing the learned appearance embedding for re-ID.

                  <p>Human-robot walking with prosthetic legs and exoskeletons, especially over complex terrains such as stairs, remains a significant challenge.Egocentric vision has the unique potential to detect the walking environment prior to physical interactions, which can improve transitions to and from stairs.This motivated us to create the StairNet initiative to support the development of new deep learning models for visual sensing and recognition of stairs, with an emphasis on lightweight and efficient neural networks for onboard real-time inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we present an overview of the development of our large-scale dataset with over 515,000 manually labeled images, as well as our development of different deep learning models (e.g., 2D and 3D CNN, hybrid CNN and LSTM, and ViT networks) and training methods (e.g., supervised learning with temporal data and semi-supervised learning with unlabeled images) using our new dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>We consistently achieved high classification accuracy (i.e., up to 98.8%) with different designs, offering trade-offs between model accuracy and size.When deployed on mobile devices with GPU and NPU accelerators, our deep learning models achieved inference speeds up to 2.8 ms.We also deployed our models on custom-designed CPU-powered smart glasses.However, limitations in the embedded hardware yielded slower inference speeds of 1.5 seconds, presenting a trade-off between human-centered design and performance.Overall, we showed that StairNet can be an effective platform to develop and study new visual perception systems for human-robot locomotion with applications in exoskeleton and prosthetic leg control.</p>

                Do Language Models Learn Semantics of Code? A Case Study in Vulnerability Detection

                  <p>Recently, pretrained language models have shown state-of-the-art performance on the vulnerability detection task.These models are pretrained on a large corpus of source code, then fine-tuned on a smaller supervised vulnerability dataset.Due to the different training objectives and the performance of the models, it is interesting to consider whether the models have learned the semantics of code relevant to vulnerability detection, namely bug semantics, and if so, how the alignment to bug semantics relates to model performance.In this paper, we analyze the models using three distinct methods: interpretability tools, attention analysis, and interaction matrix analysis.We compare the models' influential feature sets with the bug semantic features which define the causes of bugs, including buggy paths and Potentially Vulnerable Statements (PVS).We find that (1) better-performing models also aligned better with PVS, (2) the models failed to align strongly to PVS, and (3) the models failed to align at all to buggy paths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on our analysis, we developed two annotation methods which highlight the bug semantics inside the model's inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>We evaluated our approach on four distinct transformer models and four vulnerability datasets and found that our annotations improved the models' performance in the majority of settings - 11 out of 16, with up to 9.57 points improvement in F1 score compared to conventional fine-tuning.We further found that with our annotations, the models aligned up to 232% better to potentially vulnerable statements.Our findings indicate that it is helpful to provide the model with information of the bug semantics, that the model can attend to it, and motivate future work in learning more complex path-based bug semantics.Our code and data are available at https://figshare.com/s/4a16a528d6874aad51a0.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for a myriad of groundbreaking applications in various fields.However, a significant challenge arises as these models often "hallucinate", i.e., fabricate facts without providing users an apparent means to discern the veracity of their statements.Uncertainty estimation (UE) methods are one path to safer, more responsible, and more effective use of LLMs.However, to date, research on UE methods for LLMs has been focused primarily on theoretical rather than engineering contributions.In this work, we tackle this issue by introducing LM-Polygraph, a framework with implementations of a battery of state-of-the-art UE methods for LLMs in text generation tasks, with unified program interfaces in Python.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, it introduces an extendable benchmark for consistent evaluation of UE techniques by researchers, and a demo web application that enriches the standard chat dialog with confidence scores, empowering end-users to discern unreliable responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>LM-Polygraph is compatible with the most recent LLMs, including BLOOMz, LLaMA-2, ChatGPT, and GPT-4, and is designed to support future releases of similarly-styled LMs.</p>

                  <p>As the capacity of deep neural networks (DNNs) increases, their need for huge amounts of data significantly grows.A common practice is to outsource the training process or collect more data over the Internet, which introduces the risks of a backdoored DNN.A backdoored DNN shows normal behavior on clean data while behaving maliciously once a trigger is injected into a sample at the test time.In such cases, the defender faces multiple difficulties.First, the available clean dataset may not be sufficient for fine-tuning and recovering the backdoored DNN.Second, it is impossible to recover the trigger in many real-world applications without information about it.In this paper, we formulate some characteristics of poisoned neurons.This backdoor suspiciousness score can rank network neurons according to their activation values, weights, and their relationship with other neurons in the same layer.Our experiments indicate the proposed method decreases the chance of attacks being successful by more than 50% with a tiny clean dataset, i.e., ten clean samples for the CIFAR-10 dataset, without significantly deteriorating the model's performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, the proposed method runs three times as fast as baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text-based Person Search (TBPS) aims to retrieve images of target pedestrian indicated by textual descriptions.It is essential for TBPS to extract fine-grained local features and align them crossing modality.Existing methods utilize external tools or heavy cross-modal interaction to achieve explicit alignment of cross-modal fine-grained features, which is inefficient and time-consuming.In this work, we propose a Vision-Guided Semantic-Group Network (VGSG) for text-based person search to extract well-aligned fine-grained visual and textual features.In the proposed VGSG, we develop a Semantic-Group Textual Learning (SGTL) module and a Vision-guided Knowledge Transfer (VGKT) module to extract textual local features under the guidance of visual local clues.In SGTL, in order to obtain the local textual representation, we group textual features from the channel dimension based on the semantic cues of language expression, which encourages similar semantic patterns to be grouped implicitly without external tools.In VGKT, a vision-guided attention is employed to extract visual-related textual features, which are inherently aligned with visual cues and termed vision-guided textual features.Furthermore, we design a relational knowledge transfer, including a vision-language similarity transfer and a class probability transfer, to adaptively propagate information of the vision-guided textual features to semantic-group textual features.With the help of relational knowledge transfer, VGKT is capable of aligning semantic-group textual features with corresponding visual features without external tools and complex pairwise interaction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent approaches have explored language-guided classifiers capable of classifying examples from novel tasks when provided with task-specific natural language explanations, instructions or prompts (Sanh et al., 2022; R. Menon et al., 2022).While these classifiers can generalize in zero-shot settings, their task performance often varies substantially between different language explanations in unpredictable ways (Lu et al., 2022; Gonen et al., 2022).Also, current approaches fail to leverage unlabeled examples that may be available in many scenarios.Here, we introduce TALC, a framework that uses data programming to adapt a language-guided classifier for a new task during inference when provided with explanations from multiple teachers and unlabeled test examples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that TALC consistently outperforms a competitive baseline from prior work by an impressive 9.3% (relative improvement). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>Further, we demonstrate the robustness of TALC to variations in the quality and quantity of provided explanations, highlighting its potential in scenarios where learning from multiple teachers or a crowd is involved.Our code is available at: https://github.com/WeiKangda/TALC.git.</p>

                  <p>Current approaches for collision avoidance and space traffic management face many challenges, mainly due to the continuous increase in the number of objects in orbit and the lack of scalable and automated solutions.To avoid catastrophic incidents, satellite owners/operators must be aware of their assets' collision risk to decide whether a collision avoidance manoeuvre needs to be performed.This process is typically executed through the use of warnings issued in the form of CDMs which contain information about the event, such as the expected TCA and the probability of collision.Our previous work presented a statistical learning model that allowed us to answer two important questions: (1) Will any new conjunctions be issued in the next specified time interval?(2) When and with what uncertainty will the next CDM arrive?However, the model was based on an empirical Bayes homogeneous Poisson process, which assumes that the arrival rates of CDMs are constant over time.In fact, the rate at which the CDMs are issued depends on the behaviour of the objects as well as on the screening process performed by third parties.Thus, in this work, we extend the previous study and propose a Bayesian non-homogeneous Poisson process implemented with high precision using a Probabilistic Programming Language to fully describe the underlying phenomena.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare the proposed solution with a baseline model to demonstrate the added value of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>The results show that this problem can be successfully modelled by our Bayesian non-homogeneous Poisson Process with greater accuracy, contributing to the development of automated collision avoidance systems and helping operators react timely but sparingly with satellite manoeuvres.</p>

                  <p>Mixup refers to interpolation-based data augmentation, originally motivated as a way to go beyond empirical risk minimization (ERM).Its extensions mostly focus on the definition of interpolation and the space (input or feature) where it takes place, while the augmentation process itself is less studied.In most methods, the number of generated examples is limited to the mini-batch size and the number of examples being interpolated is limited to two (pairs), in the input space.   We make progress in this direction by introducing MultiMix, which generates an arbitrarily large number of interpolated examples beyond the mini-batch size and interpolates the entire mini-batch in the embedding space.Effectively, we sample on the entire convex hull of the mini-batch rather than along linear segments between pairs of examples.   On sequence data, we further extend to Dense MultiMix.We densely interpolate features and target labels at each spatial location and also apply the loss densely.To mitigate the lack of dense labels, we inherit labels from examples and weight interpolation factors by attention as a measure of confidence.   Overall, we increase the number of loss terms per mini-batch by orders of magnitude at little additional cost.This is only possible because of interpolating in the embedding space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We empirically show that our solutions yield significant improvement over state-of-the-art mixup methods on four different benchmarks, despite interpolation being only linear. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>By analyzing the embedding space, we show that the classes are more tightly clustered and uniformly spread over the embedding space, thereby explaining the improved behavior.</p>

                  <p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have risen to prominence in the field of deep learning, facilitating the generation of realistic data from random noise.The effectiveness of GANs often depends on the quality of feature extraction, a critical aspect of their architecture.This paper introduces L-WaveBlock, a novel and robust feature extractor that leverages the capabilities of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with deep learning methodologies.L-WaveBlock is catered to quicken the convergence of GAN generators while simultaneously enhancing their performance.The paper demonstrates the remarkable utility of L-WaveBlock across three datasets, a road satellite imagery dataset, the CelebA dataset and the GoPro dataset, showcasing its ability to ease feature extraction and make it more efficient.By utilizing DWT, L-WaveBlock efficiently captures the intricate details of both structural and textural details, and further partitions feature maps into orthogonal subbands across multiple scales while preserving essential information at the same time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Not only does it lead to faster convergence, but also gives competent results on every dataset by employing the L-WaveBlock. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>The proposed method achieves an Inception Score of 3.6959 and a Structural Similarity Index of 0.4261 on the maps dataset, a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio of 29.05 and a Structural Similarity Index of 0.874 on the CelebA dataset.The proposed method performs competently to the state-of-the-art for the image denoising dataset, albeit not better, but still leads to faster convergence than conventional methods.With this, L-WaveBlock emerges as a robust and efficient tool for enhancing GAN-based image generation, demonstrating superior convergence speed and competitive performance across multiple datasets for image resolution, image generation and image denoising.</p>

                  <p>Tucker decomposition is a powerful tensor model to handle multi-aspect data.It demonstrates the low-rank property by decomposing the grid-structured data as interactions between a core tensor and a set of object representations (factors).A fundamental assumption of such decomposition is that there were finite objects in each aspect or mode, corresponding to discrete indexes of data entries.However, many real-world data are not naturally posed in the setting.For example, geographic data is represented as continuous indexes of latitude and longitude coordinates, and cannot fit tensor models directly.To generalize Tucker decomposition to such scenarios, we propose Functional Bayesian Tucker Decomposition (FunBaT).We treat the continuous-indexed data as the interaction between the Tucker core and a group of latent functions.We use Gaussian processes (GP) as functional priors to model the latent functions, and then convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE) to reduce computational cost.An efficient inference algorithm is further developed for scalable posterior approximation based on advanced message-passing techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The advantage of our method is shown in both synthetic data and several real-world applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>Alignment with human preference is a desired property of large language models (LLMs).Currently, the main alignment approach is based on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).Despite the effectiveness of RLHF, it is intricate to implement and train, thus recent studies explore how to develop alternative alignment approaches based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT).A major limitation of SFT is that it essentially does imitation learning, which cannot fully understand what are the expected behaviors.To address this issue, we propose an improved alignment approach named FIGA.Different from prior methods, we incorporate fine-grained (i.e., token or phrase level) quality signals that are derived by contrasting good and bad responses.Our approach has made two major contributions.Firstly, we curate a refined alignment dataset that pairs initial responses and the corresponding revised ones.Secondly, we devise a new loss function can leverage fine-grained quality signals to instruct the learning of LLMs for alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approaches by comparing a number of competitive baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span></p>

                  <p>Stateful policies play an important role in reinforcement learning, such as handling partially observable environments, enhancing robustness, or imposing an inductive bias directly into the policy structure.The conventional method for training stateful policies is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), which comes with significant drawbacks, such as slow training due to sequential gradient propagation and the occurrence of vanishing or exploding gradients.The gradient is often truncated to address these issues, resulting in a biased policy update.We present a novel approach for training stateful policies by decomposing the latter into a stochastic internal state kernel and a stateless policy, jointly optimized by following the stateful policy gradient.We introduce different versions of the stateful policy gradient theorem, enabling us to easily instantiate stateful variants of popular reinforcement learning and imitation learning algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of our new gradient estimator and compare it with BPTT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>We evaluate our approach on complex continuous control tasks, e.g., humanoid locomotion, and demonstrate that our gradient estimator scales effectively with task complexity while offering a faster and simpler alternative to BPTT.</p>

                  <p>Image captioning studies heavily rely on automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU and METEOR.However, such n-gram-based metrics have been shown to correlate poorly with human evaluation, leading to the proposal of alternative metrics such as SPICE for English; however, no equivalent metrics have been established for other languages.Therefore, in this study, we propose an automatic evaluation metric called JaSPICE, which evaluates Japanese captions based on scene graphs.The proposed method generates a scene graph from dependencies and the predicate-argument structure, and extends the graph using synonyms.We conducted experiments employing 10 image captioning models trained on STAIR Captions and PFN-PIC and constructed the Shichimi dataset, which contains 103,170 human evaluations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results showed that our metric outperformed the baseline metrics for the correlation coefficient with the human evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Traditionally, compiler researchers either conduct experiments within an existing production compiler or develop their own prototype compiler; both options come with trade-offs.On one hand, prototyping in a production compiler can be cumbersome, as they are often optimized for program compilation speed at the expense of software simplicity and development speed.On the other hand, the transition from a prototype compiler to production requires significant engineering work.To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of sidekick compiler frameworks, an approach that uses multiple frameworks that interoperate with each other by leveraging textual interchange formats and declarative descriptions of abstractions.Each such compiler framework is specialized for specific use cases, such as performance or prototyping.Abstractions are by design shared across frameworks, simplifying the transition from prototyping to production.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate this idea with xDSL, a sidekick for MLIR focused on prototyping and teaching. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>xDSLinteroperates with MLIR through a shared textual IR and the exchange of IRs through an IR Definition Language.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The benefits of sidekick compiler frameworks are evaluated by showing on three use cases how xDSL impacts their development: teaching, DSL compilation, and rewrite system prototyping. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>We also investigate the trade-offs that xDSL offers, and demonstrate how we simplify the transition between frameworks using the IRDL dialect.With sidekick compilation, we envision a future in which engineers minimize the cost of development by choosing a framework built for their immediate needs, and later transitioning to production with minimal overhead.</p>
