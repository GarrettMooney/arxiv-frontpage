                  <p>Background: Pain assessment in individuals with neurological conditions, especially those with limited self-report ability and altered facial expressions, presents challenges.Existing measures, relying on direct observation by caregivers, lack sensitivity and specificity.In cerebral palsy, pain is a common comorbidity and a reliable evaluation protocol is crucial.Thus, having an automatic system that recognizes facial expressions could be of enormous help when diagnosing pain in this type of patient.   Objectives: 1) to build a dataset of facial pain expressions in individuals with cerebral palsy, and 2) to develop an automated facial recognition system based on deep learning for pain assessment addressed to this population.   Methods: Ten neural networks were trained on three pain image databases, including the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database, the Multimodal Intensity Pain Dataset, and the Delaware Pain Database.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, a curated dataset (CPPAIN) was created, consisting of 109 preprocessed facial pain expression images from individuals with cerebral palsy, categorized by two physiotherapists using the Facial Action Coding System observational scale.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>Results: InceptionV3 exhibited promising performance on the CP-PAIN dataset, achieving an accuracy of 62.67% and an F1 score of 61.12%.Explainable artificial intelligence techniques revealed consistent essential features for pain identification across models.   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models for robust pain detection in populations with neurological conditions and communication disabilities.The creation of a larger dataset specific to cerebral palsy would further enhance model accuracy, offering a valuable tool for discerning subtle and idiosyncratic pain expressions.The insights gained could extend to other complex neurological conditions.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased striking results on existing logical reasoning benchmarks, with some models even surpassing human performance.However, the true depth of their competencies and robustness, in mathematical reasoning tasks, remains an open question.In response, we develop (i) an ontology of perturbations of maths questions, (ii) a semi-automatic method of perturbation, and (iii) a dataset of perturbed maths questions to probe the limits of LLM capabilities in mathematical reasoning tasks.These controlled perturbations span across multiple fine dimensions of the structural and representational aspects of maths questions.Using GPT-4, we generated the MORE dataset by perturbing randomly selected five seed questions from GSM8K. This process was guided by our ontology and involved a thorough automatic and manual filtering process, yielding a set of 216 maths problems.We conducted comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs on MORE.The results show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions.This strongly suggests that current LLMs lack robust mathematical skills and deep reasoning abilities.This research not only identifies multiple gaps in the capabilities of current models, but also highlights multiple potential directions for future development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset will be made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/GSM8k_MORE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span></p>

                  <p>There are two common ways in which developers are incorporating proprietary and domain-specific data when building applications of Large Language Models (LLMs): Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-Tuning.RAG augments the prompt with the external data, while fine-Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself.However, the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood.In this paper, we propose a pipeline for fine-tuning and RAG, and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs, including Llama2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.Our pipeline consists of multiple stages, including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers, using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results.We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine-Tuning pipeline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p.when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further.In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%.Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.</p>

                  <p>With the rise in communication capacity, deep neural networks (DNN) for digital pre-distortion (DPD) to correct non-linearity in wideband power amplifiers (PAs) have become prominent.Yet, there is a void in open-source and measurement-setup-independent platforms for fast DPD exploration and objective DPD model comparison.This paper presents an open-source framework, OpenDPD, crafted in PyTorch, with an associated dataset for PA modeling and DPD learning.We introduce a Dense Gated Recurrent Unit (DGRU)-DPD, trained via a novel end-to-end learning architecture, outperforming previous DPD models on a digital PA DPA in the new digital transmitter (DTX) architecture with unconventional transfer characteristics compared to analog PAs.Measurements show our DGRU-DPD achieves an ACPR of -44.69/-44.47 dBc and an EVM of -35.22 dB for 200 MHz OFDM signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>OpenDPD code, datasets, and documentation are publicly available at https://github.com/lab-emi/OpenDPD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span></p>

                  <p>The evolution of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been significantly influenced by six core challenges (Koehn and Knowles, 2017), which have acted as benchmarks for progress in this field.This study revisits these challenges, offering insights into their ongoing relevance in the context of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): domain mismatch, amount of parallel data, rare word prediction, translation of long sentences, attention model as word alignment, and sub-optimal beam search.Our empirical findings indicate that LLMs effectively lessen the reliance on parallel data for major languages in the pretraining phase.Additionally, the LLM-based translation system significantly enhances the translation of long sentences that contain approximately 80 words and shows the capability to translate documents of up to 512 words.However, despite these significant improvements, the challenges of domain mismatch and prediction of rare words persist.While the challenges of word alignment and beam search, specifically associated with NMT, may not apply to LLMs, we identify three new challenges for LLMs in translation tasks: inference efficiency, translation of low-resource languages in the pretraining phase, and human-aligned evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets and models are released at https://github.com/pangjh3/LLM4MT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models trained on massive corpora of data from the web can memorize and reproduce sensitive or private data raising both legal and ethical concerns.Unlearning, or tuning models to forget information present in their training data, provides us with a way to protect private data after training.Although several methods exist for such unlearning, it is unclear to what extent they result in models equivalent to those where the data to be forgotten was never learned in the first place.To address this challenge, we present TOFU, a Task of Fictitious Unlearning, as a benchmark aimed at helping deepen our understanding of unlearning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We offer a dataset of 200 diverse synthetic author profiles, each consisting of 20 question-answer pairs, and a subset of these profiles called the forget set that serves as the target for unlearning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span>We compile a suite of metrics that work together to provide a holistic picture of unlearning efficacy.Finally, we provide a set of baseline results from existing unlearning algorithms.Importantly, none of the baselines we consider show effective unlearning motivating continued efforts to develop approaches for unlearning that effectively tune models so that they truly behave as if they were never trained on the forget data at all.</p>

                  <p>In an era where test-time adaptation methods increasingly rely on the nuanced manipulation of batch normalization (BN) parameters, one critical assumption often goes overlooked: that of independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>test batches with respect to unknown labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>This assumption culminates in biased estimates of BN statistics and jeopardizes system stability under non-i.i.d. conditions.This paper pioneers a departure from the i.i.d. paradigm by introducing a groundbreaking strategy termed "Un-Mixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics" (UnMix-TNS).UnMix-TNS re-calibrates the instance-wise statistics used to normalize each instance in a batch by mixing it with multiple unmixed statistics components, thus inherently simulating the i.i.d. environment.The key lies in our innovative online unmixing procedure, which persistently refines these statistics components by drawing upon the closest instances from an incoming test batch.Remarkably generic in its design, UnMix-TNS seamlessly integrates with an array of state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods and pre-trained architectures equipped with BN layers.Empirical evaluations corroborate the robustness of UnMix-TNS under varied scenarios ranging from single to continual and mixed domain shifts.UnMix-TNS stands out when handling test data streams with temporal correlation, including those with corrupted real-world non-i.i.d. streams, sustaining its efficacy even with minimal batch sizes and individual samples.Our results set a new standard for test-time adaptation, demonstrating significant improvements in both stability and performance across multiple benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning is a distributed collaborative machine learning paradigm that has gained strong momentum in recent years.In federated learning, a central server periodically coordinates models with clients and aggregates the models trained locally by clients without necessitating access to local data.Despite its potential, the implementation of federated learning continues to encounter several challenges, predominantly the slow convergence that is largely due to data heterogeneity.The slow convergence becomes particularly problematic in cross-device federated learning scenarios where clients may be strongly limited by computing power and storage space, and hence counteracting methods that induce additional computation or memory cost on the client side such as auxiliary objective terms and larger training iterations can be impractical.In this paper, we propose a novel federated aggregation strategy, TurboSVM-FL, that poses no additional computation burden on the client side and can significantly accelerate convergence for federated classification task, especially when clients are "lazy" and train their models solely for few epochs for next global aggregation.TurboSVM-FL extensively utilizes support vector machine to conduct selective aggregation and max-margin spread-out regularization on class embeddings.We evaluate TurboSVM-FL on multiple datasets including FEMNIST, CelebA, and Shakespeare using user-independent validation with non-iid data distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that TurboSVM-FL can significantly outperform existing popular algorithms on convergence rate and reduce communication rounds while delivering better test metrics including accuracy, F1 score, and MCC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bug tracking systems store many bug reports, some of which are related to security.Identifying those security bug reports (SBRs) may help us predict some security-related bugs and solve security issues promptly so that the project can avoid threats and attacks.However, in the real world, the ratio of security bug reports is severely low; thus, directly training a prediction model with raw data may result in inaccurate results.Faced with the massive challenge of data imbalance, many researchers in the past have attempted to use text filtering or clustering methods to minimize the proportion of non-security bug reports (NSBRs) or apply oversampling methods to synthesize SBRs to make the dataset as balanced as possible.Nevertheless, there are still two challenges to those methods: 1) They ignore long-distance contextual information.2) They fail to generate an utterly balanced dataset.To tackle these two challenges, we propose SEDAC, a new SBR identification method that generates similar bug report vectors to solve data imbalance problems and accurately detect security bug reports.Unlike previous studies, it first converts bug reports into individual bug report vectors with distilBERT, which are based on word2vec.Then, it trains a generative model through conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) to generate similar vectors with security labels, which makes the number of SBRs equal to NSBRs'.Finally, balanced data are used to train a security bug report classifier.To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct it on 45,940 bug reports from Chromium and four Apache projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results show that SEDAC outperforms all the baselines in g-measure with improvements of around 14.24%-50.10%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span></p>

                  <p>While deep neural networks have achieved remarkable performance, data augmentation has emerged as a crucial strategy to mitigate overfitting and enhance network performance.These techniques hold particular significance in industrial manufacturing contexts.Recently, image mixing-based methods have been introduced, exhibiting improved performance on public benchmark datasets.However, their application to industrial tasks remains challenging.The manufacturing environment generates massive amounts of unlabeled data on a daily basis, with only a few instances of abnormal data occurrences.This leads to severe data imbalance.Thus, creating well-balanced datasets is not straightforward due to the high costs associated with labeling.Nonetheless, this is a crucial step for enhancing productivity.For this reason, we introduce ContextMix, a method tailored for industrial applications and benchmark datasets.ContextMix generates novel data by resizing entire images and integrating them into other images within the batch.This approach enables our method to learn discriminative features based on varying sizes from resized images and train informative secondary features for object recognition using occluded images.With the minimal additional computation cost of image resizing, ContextMix enhances performance compared to existing augmentation techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate its effectiveness across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using various network architectures on public benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our proposed method demonstrates improved results across a range of robustness tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Its efficacy in real industrial environments is particularly noteworthy, as demonstrated using the passive component dataset.</p>

                  <p>Wireless Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, particularly gaining momentum in domains with confidential and private data on mobile clients.However, the location-dependent performance, in terms of transmission rates and susceptibility to transmission errors, poses major challenges for wireless FL's convergence speed and accuracy.The challenge is more acute for hostile environments without a metric that authenticates the data quality and security profile of the clients.In this context, this paper proposes a novel risk-aware accelerated FL framework that accounts for the clients heterogeneity in the amount of possessed data, transmission rates, transmission errors, and trustworthiness.Classifying clients according to their location-dependent performance and trustworthiness profiles, we propose a dynamic risk-aware global model aggregation scheme that allows clients to participate in descending order of their transmission rates and an ascending trustworthiness constraint.In particular, the transmission rate is the dominant participation criterion for initial rounds to accelerate the convergence speed.Our model then progressively relaxes the transmission rate restriction to explore more training data at cell-edge clients.The aggregation rounds incorporate a debiasing factor that accounts for transmission errors.Risk-awareness is enabled by a validation set, where the base station eliminates non-trustworthy clients at the fine-tuning stage.The proposed scheme is benchmarked against a conservative scheme (i.e., only allowing trustworthy devices) and an aggressive scheme (i.e., oblivious to the trust metric).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The numerical results highlight the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of accuracy and convergence speed when compared to both benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span></p>

Due to its worst-case nature, there is an almost-linear $\Omega(|I|^{1-\epsilon})$ regret lower bound, when only one query per round is allowed [Daniely el al, ICML 2015].Surprisingly, with just two queries per round, we give Strongly Adaptive Bandit Learner (StABL) that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n|I|})$ adaptive regret for multi-armed bandits with $n$ arms.The bound is tight and cannot be improved in general.Our algorithm leverages a multiplicative update scheme of varying stepsizes and a carefully chosen observation distribution to control the variance.Furthermore, we extend our results and provide optimal algorithms in the bandit convex optimization setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms under volatile environments and for downstream tasks, such as algorithm selection for hyperparameter optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>As deep learning (DL) models are widely and effectively used in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms, there is a rapidly growing interest in DL watermarking techniques that can be used to confirm the ownership of a particular model.Unfortunately, these methods usually produce watermarks susceptible to model stealing attacks.In our research, we introduce a novel trigger set-based watermarking approach that demonstrates resilience against functionality stealing attacks, particularly those involving extraction and distillation.Our approach does not require additional model training and can be applied to any model architecture.The key idea of our method is to compute the trigger set, which is transferable between the source model and the set of proxy models with a high probability.In our experimental study, we show that if the probability of the set being transferable is reasonably high, it can be effectively used for ownership verification of the stolen model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on multiple benchmarks and show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art watermarking techniques in all considered experimental setups. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span></p>

                  <p>In an era where test-time adaptation methods increasingly rely on the nuanced manipulation of batch normalization (BN) parameters, one critical assumption often goes overlooked: that of independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)test batches with respect to unknown labels.This assumption culminates in biased estimates of BN statistics and jeopardizes system stability under non-i.i.d. conditions.This paper pioneers a departure from the i.i.d. paradigm by introducing a groundbreaking strategy termed "Un-Mixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics" (UnMix-TNS).UnMix-TNS re-calibrates the instance-wise statistics used to normalize each instance in a batch by mixing it with multiple unmixed statistics components, thus inherently simulating the i.i.d. environment.The key lies in our innovative online unmixing procedure, which persistently refines these statistics components by drawing upon the closest instances from an incoming test batch.Remarkably generic in its design, UnMix-TNS seamlessly integrates with an array of state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods and pre-trained architectures equipped with BN layers.Empirical evaluations corroborate the robustness of UnMix-TNS under varied scenarios ranging from single to continual and mixed domain shifts.UnMix-TNS stands out when handling test data streams with temporal correlation, including those with corrupted real-world non-i.i.d. streams, sustaining its efficacy even with minimal batch sizes and individual samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results set a new standard for test-time adaptation, demonstrating significant improvements in both stability and performance across multiple benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span></p>

                  <p>Commit messages are natural language descriptions of code changes, which are important for software evolution such as code understanding and maintenance.However, previous methods are trained on the entire dataset without considering the fact that a portion of commit messages adhere to good practice (i.e., good-practice commits), while the rest do not.On the basis of our empirical study, we discover that training on good-practice commits significantly contributes to the commit message generation.Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel knowledge-aware denoising learning method called KADEL.Considering that good-practice commits constitute only a small proportion of the dataset, we align the remaining training samples with these good-practice commits.To achieve this, we propose a model that learns the commit knowledge by training on good-practice commits.This knowledge model enables supplementing more information for training samples that do not conform to good practice.However, since the supplementary information may contain noise or prediction errors, we propose a dynamic denoising training method.This method composes a distribution-aware confidence function and a dynamic distribution list, which enhances the effectiveness of the training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on the whole MCMD dataset demonstrate that our method overall achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Our source code and data are available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/KADEL</p>

In this paper, we obtain both upper and lower bounds for this problem.In particular, we show that the problem of finding the best data distribution from selectivity queries is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete.On the positive side, we describe a Monte Carlo algorithm that constructs, in time $O((n+\delta^{-d})\delta^{-2}\mathop{\mathrm{polylog}})$, a discrete distribution $\tilde{\mathcal{D}}$ of size $O(\delta^{-2})$, such that $\mathrm{err}_p(\tilde{\mathcal{D}},\mathcal{Z})\leq \min_{\mathcal{D}}\mathrm{err}_p(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{Z})+\delta$ (for $p=1,2,\infty$) where the minimum is taken over all discrete distributions.We also establish conditional lower bounds, which strongly indicate the infeasibility of relative approximations as well as removal of the exponential dependency on the dimension for additive approximations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This suggests that significant improvements to our algorithm are unlikely. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>In-context learning (ICL) has consistently demonstrated superior performance over zero-shot performance in large language models (LLMs).However, the understanding of the dynamics of ICL and the aspects that influence downstream performance remains limited, especially for natural language generation (NLG) tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work aims to address this gap by investigating the ICL capabilities of LLMs and studying the impact of different aspects of the in-context demonstrations for the task of machine translation (MT). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>Our preliminary investigations aim to discern whether in-context learning (ICL) is predominantly influenced by demonstrations or instructions by applying diverse perturbations to in-context demonstrations while preserving the task instruction.We observe varying behavior to perturbed examples across different model families, notably with BLOOM-7B derivatives being severely influenced by noise, whereas Llama 2 derivatives not only exhibit robustness but also tend to show enhancements over the clean baseline when subject to perturbed demonstrations.This suggests that the robustness of ICL may be governed by several factors, including the type of noise, perturbation direction (source or target), the extent of pretraining of the specific model, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks if applicable.Further investigation is warranted to develop a comprehensive understanding of these factors in future research.</p>

We build upon the recommender that has been in production since 2018, RevRecV1.We found that reviewers were being assigned based on prior authorship of files.We reviewed the literature for successful features and experimented with them with RevRecV2 in production.The most important feature in our new model was the familiarity of the author and reviewer, we saw an overall improvement in accuracy of 14 percentage points.   Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

We conduct historical analyses to understand the natural concentration of review workload and the degree of knowledge spreading that is inherent in code review.Even though review workload is highly concentrated, we show that code review natural spreads knowledge thereby reducing the files at risk to turnover.   Using simulation, we evaluate existing code review recommenders and develop novel recommenders to understand their impact on the level of expertise during review, the workload of reviewers, and the files at risk to turnover.Our simulations use seeded random replacement of reviewers to allow us to compare the reviewer recommenders without the confounding variation of different reviewers being replaced for each recommender.   Combining recommenders, we develop the SofiaWL recommender that suggests experts with low active review workload when none of the files under review are known by only one developer.In contrast, when knowledge is concentrated on one developer, it sends the review to other reviewers to spread knowledge.For the projects we study, we are able to globally increase expertise during reviews, +3%, reduce workload concentration, -12%, and reduce the files at risk, -28%.We make our scripts and data available in our replication package.Developers can optimize for a particular outcome measure based on the needs of their project, or use our GitHub bot to automatically balance the outcomes.</p>
