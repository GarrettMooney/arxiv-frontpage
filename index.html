                  <p>3D vision-language grounding, which focuses on aligning language with the 3D physical environment, stands as a cornerstone in the development of embodied agents.In comparison to recent advancements in the 2D domain, grounding language in 3D scenes faces several significant challenges: (i) the inherent complexity of 3D scenes due to the diverse object configurations, their rich attributes, and intricate relationships; (ii) the scarcity of paired 3D vision-language data to support grounded learning; and (iii) the absence of a unified learning framework to distill knowledge from grounded 3D data.In this work, we aim to address these three major challenges in 3D vision-language by examining the potential of systematically upscaling 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse, encompassing about 68K 3D indoor scenes and comprising 2.5M vision-language pairs derived from both human annotations and our scalable scene-graph-based generation approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.917</span></span>We demonstrate that this scaling allows for a unified pre-training framework, Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), for 3D vision-language learning.Through extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of GPS by achieving state-of-the-art performance on all existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks.The vast potential of SceneVerse and GPS is unveiled through zero-shot transfer experiments in the challenging 3D vision-language tasks.Project website: https://scene-verse.github.io .</p>

This process was guided by our ontology and involved a thorough automatic and manual filtering process, yielding a set of 216 maths problems.We conducted comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs on MORE.The results show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions.This strongly suggests that current LLMs lack robust mathematical skills and deep reasoning abilities.This research not only identifies multiple gaps in the capabilities of current models, but also highlights multiple potential directions for future development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset will be made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/GSM8k_MORE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span></p>

                  <p>Document Layout Analysis, which is the task of identifying different semantic regions inside of a document page, is a subject of great interest for both computer scientists and humanities scholars as it represents a fundamental step towards further analysis tasks for the former and a powerful tool to improve and facilitate the study of the documents for the latter.However, many of the works currently present in the literature, especially when it comes to the available datasets, fail to meet the needs of both worlds and, in particular, tend to lean towards the needs and common practices of the computer science side, leading to resources that are not representative of the humanities real needs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For this reason, the present paper introduces U-DIADS-Bib, a novel, pixel-precise, non-overlapping and noiseless document layout analysis dataset developed in close collaboration between specialists in the fields of computer vision and humanities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>Furthermore, we propose a novel, computer-aided, segmentation pipeline in order to alleviate the burden represented by the time-consuming process of manual annotation, necessary for the generation of the ground truth segmentation maps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we present a standardized few-shot version of the dataset (U-DIADS-BibFS), with the aim of encouraging the development of models and solutions able to address this task with as few samples as possible, which would allow for more effective use in a real-world scenario, where collecting a large number of segmentations is not always feasible. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span></p>

                  <p>There are two common ways in which developers are incorporating proprietary and domain-specific data when building applications of Large Language Models (LLMs): Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-Tuning.RAG augments the prompt with the external data, while fine-Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself.However, the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood.In this paper, we propose a pipeline for fine-tuning and RAG, and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs, including Llama2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.Our pipeline consists of multiple stages, including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers, using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results.We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine-Tuning pipeline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p.when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further.In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%.Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.</p>

                  <p>The evolution of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been significantly influenced by six core challenges (Koehn and Knowles, 2017), which have acted as benchmarks for progress in this field.This study revisits these challenges, offering insights into their ongoing relevance in the context of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): domain mismatch, amount of parallel data, rare word prediction, translation of long sentences, attention model as word alignment, and sub-optimal beam search.Our empirical findings indicate that LLMs effectively lessen the reliance on parallel data for major languages in the pretraining phase.Additionally, the LLM-based translation system significantly enhances the translation of long sentences that contain approximately 80 words and shows the capability to translate documents of up to 512 words.However, despite these significant improvements, the challenges of domain mismatch and prediction of rare words persist.While the challenges of word alignment and beam search, specifically associated with NMT, may not apply to LLMs, we identify three new challenges for LLMs in translation tasks: inference efficiency, translation of low-resource languages in the pretraining phase, and human-aligned evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets and models are released at https://github.com/pangjh3/LLM4MT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span></p>

                  <p>With a 676% growth rate in HIV incidence between 2010 and 2021, the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Philippines is the one that is spreading the quickest in the western Pacific.Although the full effects of COVID-19 on HIV services and development are still unknown, it is predicted that such disruptions could lead to a significant increase in HIV casualties.Therefore, the nation needs some modeling and forecasting techniques to foresee the spread pattern and enhance the governments prevention, treatment, testing, and care program.In this study, the researcher uses Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network to forecast time series during the period when the COVID-19 pandemic strikes the nation, using statistics taken from the HIV/AIDS and ART Registry of the Philippines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>After training, validation, and testing of data, the study finds that the predicted cumulative cases in the nation by 2030 will reach 145,273. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>Additionally, there is very little difference between observed and anticipated HIV epidemic levels, as evidenced by reduced RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values as well as a greater coefficient of determination.Further research revealed that the Philippines seems far from achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 of Project 2030 due to an increase in the nations rate of new HIV infections.Despite the detrimental effects of COVID-19 spread on HIV/AIDS efforts nationwide, the Philippine government, under the Marcos administration, must continue to adhere to the United Nations 90-90-90 targets by enhancing its ART program and ensuring that all vital health services are readily accessible and available.</p>

                  <p>Large archival collections, such as email or government documents, must be manually reviewed to identify any sensitive information before the collection can be released publicly.Sensitivity classification has received a lot of attention in the literature.However, more recently, there has been increasing interest in developing sensitivity-aware search engines that can provide users with relevant search results, while ensuring that no sensitive documents are returned to the user.Sensitivity-aware search would mitigate the need for a manual sensitivity review prior to collections being made available publicly.To develop such systems, there is a need for test collections that contain relevance assessments for a set of information needs as well as ground-truth labels for a variety of sensitivity categories.The well-known Enron email collection contains a classification ground-truth that can be used to represent sensitive information, e.g., the Purely Personal and Personal but in Professional Context categories can be used to represent sensitive personal information.However, the existing Enron collection does not contain a set of information needs and relevance assessments.In this work, we present a collection of fifty information needs (topics) with crowdsourced query formulations (3 per topic) and relevance assessments (11,471 in total) for the Enron collection (mean number of relevant documents per topic = 11, variance = 34.7).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The developed information needs, queries and relevance judgements are available on GitHub and will be available along with the existing Enron collection through the popular ir_datasets library. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>Our proposed collection results in the first freely available test collection for developing sensitivity-aware search systems.</p>

                  <p>The argument sufficiency assessment task aims to determine if the premises of a given argument support its conclusion.To tackle this task, existing works often train a classifier on data annotated by humans.However, annotating data is laborious, and annotations are often inconsistent due to subjective criteria.Motivated by the probability of sufficiency (PS) definition in the causal literature, we propose CASA, a zero-shot causality-driven argument sufficiency assessment framework.PS measures how likely introducing the premise event would lead to the conclusion, when both the premise and conclusion events are absent.To estimate this probability, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to generate contexts that are inconsistent with the premise and conclusion, and revise them by injecting the premise event.Experiments on two logical fallacy detection datasets demonstrate that CASA accurately identifies insufficient arguments.We further deploy CASA in a writing assistance application, and find that suggestions generated by CASA enhance the sufficiency of student-written arguments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/xxxiaol/CASA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span></p>

                  <p>Charts play a vital role in data visualization, understanding data patterns, and informed decision-making.However, their unique combination of graphical elements (e.g., bars, lines) and textual components (e.g., labels, legends) poses challenges for general-purpose multimodal models.While vision-language models trained on chart data excel in comprehension, they struggle with generalization and require task-specific fine-tuning.To address these challenges, we propose ChartAssistant, a chart-based vision-language model for universal chart comprehension and reasoning.ChartAssistant leverages ChartSFT, a comprehensive dataset covering diverse chart-related tasks with basic and specialized chart types.It undergoes a two-stage training process, starting with pre-training on chart-to-table parsing to align chart and text, followed by multitask instruction-following fine-tuning.This approach enables ChartAssistant to achieve competitive performance across various chart tasks without task-specific fine-tuning.Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains over the state-of-the-art UniChart method, outperforming OpenAI's GPT-4V(ision) on real-world chart data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and data are available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ChartAst. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span></p>

                  <p>Wireless Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, particularly gaining momentum in domains with confidential and private data on mobile clients.However, the location-dependent performance, in terms of transmission rates and susceptibility to transmission errors, poses major challenges for wireless FL's convergence speed and accuracy.The challenge is more acute for hostile environments without a metric that authenticates the data quality and security profile of the clients.In this context, this paper proposes a novel risk-aware accelerated FL framework that accounts for the clients heterogeneity in the amount of possessed data, transmission rates, transmission errors, and trustworthiness.Classifying clients according to their location-dependent performance and trustworthiness profiles, we propose a dynamic risk-aware global model aggregation scheme that allows clients to participate in descending order of their transmission rates and an ascending trustworthiness constraint.In particular, the transmission rate is the dominant participation criterion for initial rounds to accelerate the convergence speed.Our model then progressively relaxes the transmission rate restriction to explore more training data at cell-edge clients.The aggregation rounds incorporate a debiasing factor that accounts for transmission errors.Risk-awareness is enabled by a validation set, where the base station eliminates non-trustworthy clients at the fine-tuning stage.The proposed scheme is benchmarked against a conservative scheme (i.e., only allowing trustworthy devices) and an aggressive scheme (i.e., oblivious to the trust metric).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The numerical results highlight the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of accuracy and convergence speed when compared to both benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span></p>

Due to its worst-case nature, there is an almost-linear $\Omega(|I|^{1-\epsilon})$ regret lower bound, when only one query per round is allowed [Daniely el al, ICML 2015].Surprisingly, with just two queries per round, we give Strongly Adaptive Bandit Learner (StABL) that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n|I|})$ adaptive regret for multi-armed bandits with $n$ arms.The bound is tight and cannot be improved in general.Our algorithm leverages a multiplicative update scheme of varying stepsizes and a carefully chosen observation distribution to control the variance.Furthermore, we extend our results and provide optimal algorithms in the bandit convex optimization setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms under volatile environments and for downstream tasks, such as algorithm selection for hyperparameter optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>Two-dimensional Delaunay triangulation is a fundamental aspect of computational geometry.This paper presents a novel algorithm that is specifically designed to ensure the correctness of 2D Delaunay triangulation, namely the Polygonal Sequence-driven Triangulation Validator (PSTV).Our research highlights the paramount importance of proper triangulation and the often overlooked, yet profound, impact of rounding errors in numerical computations on the precision of triangulation.The primary objective of the PSTV algorithm is to identify these computational errors and ensure the accuracy of the triangulation output.In addition to validating the correctness of triangulation, this study underscores the significance of the Delaunay property for the quality of finite element methods.Effective strategies are proposed to verify this property for a triangulation and correct it when necessary.While acknowledging the difficulty of rectifying complex triangulation errors such as overlapping triangles, these strategies provide valuable insights on identifying the locations of these errors and remedying them.The unique feature of the PSTV algorithm lies in its adoption of floating-point filters in place of interval arithmetic, striking an effective balance between computational efficiency and precision.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research sets a vital precedent for error reduction and precision enhancement in computational geometry. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

Specifically, when $f$ is monotone and $\gamma$-weakly DR-submodular, we propose an auxiliary function $F$ whose stationary points can provide a better $(1-e^{-\gamma})$-approximation than the $(\gamma^2/(1+\gamma^2))$-approximation guaranteed by the stationary points of $f$ itself.Similarly, for the non-monotone case, we devise another auxiliary function $F$ whose stationary points can achieve an optimal $\frac{1-\min_{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathcal{C}}\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_{\infty}}{4}$-approximation guarantee where $\mathcal{C}$ is a convex constraint set.In contrast, the stationary points of the original non-monotone DR-submodular function can be arbitrarily bad~\citep{chen2023continuous}.Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of our boosting technique on four problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In all of these four problems, our resulting variants of boosting PGA algorithm beat the previous standard PGA in several aspects such as approximation ratio and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our boosting PGA methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

                  <p>The performance of machine learning models often degrades after deployment due to data distribution shifts.In many use cases, it is impossible to calculate the post-deployment performance because labels are unavailable or significantly delayed.Proxy methods for evaluating model performance stability, like drift detection techniques, do not properly quantify data distribution shift impact.As a solution, we propose a robust and accurate performance estimation method for evaluating ML classification models on unlabeled data that accurately quantifies the impact of covariate shift on model performance.We call it multi-calibrated confidence-based performance estimation (M-CBPE).It is model and data-type agnostic and works for any performance metric.It does not require access to the monitored model - it uses the model predictions and probability estimates.M-CBPE does not need user input on the nature of the covariate shift as it fully learns from the data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate it with over 600 dataset-model pairs from US census data and compare it with multiple benchmarks using several evaluation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show that M-CBPE is the best method to estimate the performance of classification models in any evaluation context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models trained on massive corpora of data from the web can memorize and reproduce sensitive or private data raising both legal and ethical concerns.Unlearning, or tuning models to forget information present in their training data, provides us with a way to protect private data after training.Although several methods exist for such unlearning, it is unclear to what extent they result in models equivalent to those where the data to be forgotten was never learned in the first place.To address this challenge, we present TOFU, a Task of Fictitious Unlearning, as a benchmark aimed at helping deepen our understanding of unlearning.We offer a dataset of 200 diverse synthetic author profiles, each consisting of 20 question-answer pairs, and a subset of these profiles called the forget set that serves as the target for unlearning.We compile a suite of metrics that work together to provide a holistic picture of unlearning efficacy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we provide a set of baseline results from existing unlearning algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Importantly, none of the baselines we consider show effective unlearning motivating continued efforts to develop approaches for unlearning that effectively tune models so that they truly behave as if they were never trained on the forget data at all.</p>

                  <p>Purpose: Body composition measurements from routine abdominal CT can yield personalized risk assessments for asymptomatic and diseased patients.In particular, attenuation and volume measures of muscle and fat are associated with important clinical outcomes, such as cardiovascular events, fractures, and death.This study evaluates the reliability of an Internal tool for the segmentation of muscle and fat (subcutaneous and visceral) as compared to the well-established public TotalSegmentator tool.   Methods: We assessed the tools across 900 CT series from the publicly available SAROS dataset, focusing on muscle, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat.The Dice score was employed to assess accuracy in subcutaneous fat and muscle segmentation.Due to the lack of ground truth segmentations for visceral fat, Cohen's Kappa was utilized to assess segmentation agreement between the tools.   Results:Our Internal tool achieved a 3% higher Dice (83.8 vs. 80.8) for subcutaneous fat and a 5% improvement (87.6 vs. 83.2) for muscle segmentation respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that our results were statistically different with p<0.01. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>For visceral fat, the Cohen's kappa score of 0.856 indicated near-perfect agreement between the two tools.Our internal tool also showed very strong correlations for muscle volume (R^2=0.99), muscle attenuation (R^2=0.93), and subcutaneous fat volume (R^2=0.99) with a moderate correlation for subcutaneous fat attenuation (R^2=0.45).   Conclusion: Our findings indicated that our Internal tool outperformed TotalSegmentator in measuring subcutaneous fat and muscle.The high Cohen's Kappa score for visceral fat suggests a reliable level of agreement between the two tools.These results demonstrate the potential of our tool in advancing the accuracy of body composition analysis.</p>

                  <p>Existing photorealistic relightable hand models require extensive identity-specific observations in different views, poses, and illuminations, and face challenges in generalizing to natural illuminations and novel identities.To bridge this gap, we present URHand, the first universal relightable hand model that generalizes across viewpoints, poses, illuminations, and identities.Our model allows few-shot personalization using images captured with a mobile phone, and is ready to be photorealistically rendered under novel illuminations.To simplify the personalization process while retaining photorealism, we build a powerful universal relightable prior based on neural relighting from multi-view images of hands captured in a light stage with hundreds of identities.The key challenge is scaling the cross-identity training while maintaining personalized fidelity and sharp details without compromising generalization under natural illuminations.To this end, we propose a spatially varying linear lighting model as the neural renderer that takes physics-inspired shading as input feature.By removing non-linear activations and bias, our specifically designed lighting model explicitly keeps the linearity of light transport.This enables single-stage training from light-stage data while generalizing to real-time rendering under arbitrary continuous illuminations across diverse identities.In addition, we introduce the joint learning of a physically based model and our neural relighting model, which further improves fidelity and generalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of both quality and generalizability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>We also demonstrate quick personalization of URHand from a short phone scan of an unseen identity.</p>

                  <p>The objective of sign language recognition is to bridge the communication gap between the deaf and the hearing.Numerous previous works train their models using the well-established connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss.During the inference stage, the CTC-based models typically take the entire sign video as input to make predictions.This type of inference scheme is referred to as offline recognition.In contrast, while mature speech recognition systems can efficiently recognize spoken words on the fly, sign language recognition still falls short due to the lack of practical online solutions.In this work, we take the first step towards filling this gap.Our approach comprises three phases: 1) developing a sign language dictionary encompassing all glosses present in a target sign language dataset; 2) training an isolated sign language recognition model on augmented signs using both conventional classification loss and our novel saliency loss; 3) employing a sliding window approach on the input sign sequence and feeding each sign clip to the well-optimized model for online recognition.Furthermore, our online recognition model can be extended to boost the performance of any offline model, and to support online translation by appending a gloss-to-text network onto the recognition model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By integrating our online framework with the previously best-performing offline model, TwoStream-SLR, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks: Phoenix-2014, Phoenix-2014T, and CSL-Daily. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Code and models will be available at https://github.com/FangyunWei/SLRT</p>

                  <p>Data races are egregious parallel programming bugs on CPUs.They are even worse on GPUs due to the hierarchical thread and memory structure, which makes it possible to write code that is correctly synchronized within a thread group while not being correct across groups.Thus far, all major data-race checkers for GPUs suffer from at least one of the following problems: they do not check races in global memory, do not work on recent GPUs, scale poorly, have not been extensively tested, miss simple data races, or are not dependable without detailed knowledge of the compiler.   Our new data-race detection tool, HiRace, overcomes these limitations.Its key novelty is an innovative parallel finite-state machine that condenses an arbitrarily long access history into a constant-length state, thus allowing it to handle large and long-running programs.HiRace is a dynamic tool that checks for thread-group shared memory and global device memory races.It utilizes source-code instrumentation, thus avoiding driver, compiler, and hardware dependencies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate it on a modern calibrated data-race benchmark suite. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>On the 580 tested CUDA kernels, 346 of which contain data races, HiRace finds races missed by other tools without false alarms and is more than 10 times faster on average than the current state of the art, while incurring only half the memory overhead.</p>

We build upon the recommender that has been in production since 2018, RevRecV1.We found that reviewers were being assigned based on prior authorship of files.We reviewed the literature for successful features and experimented with them with RevRecV2 in production.The most important feature in our new model was the familiarity of the author and reviewer, we saw an overall improvement in accuracy of 14 percentage points.   Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

We conduct historical analyses to understand the natural concentration of review workload and the degree of knowledge spreading that is inherent in code review.Even though review workload is highly concentrated, we show that code review natural spreads knowledge thereby reducing the files at risk to turnover.   Using simulation, we evaluate existing code review recommenders and develop novel recommenders to understand their impact on the level of expertise during review, the workload of reviewers, and the files at risk to turnover.Our simulations use seeded random replacement of reviewers to allow us to compare the reviewer recommenders without the confounding variation of different reviewers being replaced for each recommender.   Combining recommenders, we develop the SofiaWL recommender that suggests experts with low active review workload when none of the files under review are known by only one developer.In contrast, when knowledge is concentrated on one developer, it sends the review to other reviewers to spread knowledge.For the projects we study, we are able to globally increase expertise during reviews, +3%, reduce workload concentration, -12%, and reduce the files at risk, -28%.We make our scripts and data available in our replication package.Developers can optimize for a particular outcome measure based on the needs of their project, or use our GitHub bot to automatically balance the outcomes.</p>
