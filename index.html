                  <p>Task-oriented grasping (TOG) refers to the problem of predicting grasps on an object that enable subsequent manipulation tasks.To model the complex relationships between objects, tasks, and grasps, existing methods incorporate semantic knowledge as priors into TOG pipelines.However, the existing semantic knowledge is typically constructed based on closed-world concept sets, restraining the generalization to novel concepts out of the pre-defined sets.To address this issue, we propose GraspGPT, a large language model (LLM) based TOG framework that leverages the open-end semantic knowledge from an LLM to achieve zero-shot generalization to novel concepts.We conduct experiments on Language Augmented TaskGrasp (LA-TaskGrasp) dataset and demonstrate that GraspGPT outperforms existing TOG methods on different held-out settings when generalizing to novel concepts out of the training set.The effectiveness of GraspGPT is further validated in real-robot experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, data, appendix, and video are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/graspgpt/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>Code coverage is a widely used metric for quantifying the extent to which program elements, such as statements or branches, are executed during testing.Calculating code coverage is resource-intensive, requiring code building and execution with additional overhead for the instrumentation.Furthermore, computing coverage of any snippet of code requires the whole program context.Using Machine Learning to amortize this expensive process could lower the cost of code coverage by requiring only the source code context, and the task of code coverage prediction can be a novel benchmark for judging the ability of models to understand code.We propose a novel benchmark task called Code Coverage Prediction for Large Language Models (LLMs).We formalize this task to evaluate the capability of LLMs in understanding code execution by determining which lines of a method are executed by a given test case and inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We curate and release a dataset we call COVERAGEEVAL by executing tests and code from the HumanEval dataset and collecting code coverage information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.91</span></span>We report the performance of four state-of-the-art LLMs used for code-related tasks, including OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, Google's BARD, and Anthropic's Claude, on the Code Coverage Prediction task.Finally, we argue that code coverage as a metric and pre-training data source are valuable for overall LLM performance on software engineering tasks.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance of various computer vision applications.However, discovering novel categories in an incremental learning scenario remains a challenging problem due to the lack of prior knowledge about the number and nature of new categories.Existing methods for novel category discovery are limited by their reliance on labeled datasets and prior knowledge about the number of novel categories and the proportion of novel samples in the batch.To address the limitations and more accurately reflect real-world scenarios, in this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised class incremental learning approach for discovering novel categories on unlabeled sets without prior knowledge.The proposed method fine-tunes the feature extractor and proxy anchors on labeled sets, then splits samples into old and novel categories and clusters on the unlabeled dataset.Furthermore, the proxy anchors-based exemplar generates representative category vectors to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on fine-grained datasets under real-world scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span></p>

                  <p>Prompt learning has emerged as an efficient alternative for fine-tuning foundational models, such as CLIP, for various downstream tasks.Conventionally trained using the task-specific objective, i.e., cross-entropy loss, prompts tend to overfit downstream data distributions and find it challenging to capture task-agnostic general features from the frozen CLIP.This leads to the loss of the model's original generalization capability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, our work introduces a self-regularization framework for prompting called PromptSRC (Prompting with Self-regulating Constraints). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>PromptSRC guides the prompts to optimize for both task-specific and task-agnostic general representations using a three-pronged approach by: (a) regulating {prompted} representations via mutual agreement maximization with the frozen model, (b) regulating with self-ensemble of prompts over the training trajectory to encode their complementary strengths, and (c) regulating with textual diversity to mitigate sample diversity imbalance with the visual branch.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first regularization framework for prompt learning that avoids overfitting by jointly attending to pre-trained model features, the training trajectory during prompting, and the textual diversity.PromptSRC explicitly steers the prompts to learn a representation space that maximizes performance on downstream tasks without compromising CLIP generalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform extensive experiments on 4 benchmarks where PromptSRC overall performs favorably well compared to the existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/muzairkhattak/PromptSRC.</p>

                  <p>Performance issues permeate large-scale cloud service systems, which can lead to huge revenue losses.To ensure reliable performance, it's essential to accurately identify and localize these issues using service monitoring metrics.Given the complexity and scale of modern cloud systems, this task can be challenging and may require extensive expertise and resources beyond the capacity of individual humans.Some existing methods tackle this problem by analyzing each metric independently to detect anomalies.However, this could incur overwhelming alert storms that are difficult for engineers to diagnose manually.To pursue better performance, not only the temporal patterns of metrics but also the correlation between metrics (i.e., relational patterns) should be considered, which can be formulated as a multivariate metrics anomaly detection problem.However, most of the studies fall short of extracting these two types of features explicitly.Moreover, there exist some unlabeled anomalies mixed in the training data, which may hinder the detection performance.To address these limitations, we propose the Relational- Temporal Anomaly Detection Model (RTAnomaly) that combines the relational and temporal information of metrics.RTAnomaly employs a graph attention layer to learn the dependencies among metrics, which will further help pinpoint the anomalous metrics that may cause the anomaly effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we exploit the concept of positive unlabeled learning to address the issue of potential anomalies in the training data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>To evaluate our method, we conduct experiments on a public dataset and two industrial datasets.RTAnomaly outperforms all the baseline models by achieving an average F1 score of 0.929 and Hit@3 of 0.920, demonstrating its superiority.</p>

                  <p>Recently, deep learning models have been widely applied in program understanding tasks, and these models achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmark datasets.A major challenge of deep learning for program understanding is that the effectiveness of these approaches depends on the quality of their datasets, and these datasets often contain noisy data samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A typical kind of noise in program understanding datasets is label noises, which means that the target outputs for some inputs are mislabeled.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Label noises may have a negative impact on the performance of deep learning models, so researchers have proposed various approaches to alleviate the impact of noisy labels, and formed a new research topic: noisy label learning (NLL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on the effectiveness of noisy label learning on deep learning for program understanding datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate various noisy label learning approaches and deep learning models on two tasks: program classification and code summarization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>From the evaluation results, we find that the impact of label noise and NLL approaches on small deep learning models and large pre-trained models are different: small models are prone to label noises in program classification and NLL approaches can improve their robustness, while large pre-trained models are robust against label noises and NLL does not significantly improve their performances.On the other hand, NLL approaches have shown satisfying results in identifying noisy labeled samples for both tasks, indicating that these techniques can benefit researchers in building high-quality program understanding datasets.</p>

This paper presents the first study on the problem of assembly clone search with unseen architectures and libraries.We propose incorporating human common knowledge through large-scale pre-trained natural language models, in the form of transfer learning, into current learning-based approaches for assembly clone search.Transfer learning can aid in addressing the limitations of the existing approaches, as it can bring in broader knowledge from human experts in assembly code.We further address the sequence limit issue by proposing a reinforcement learning agent to remove unnecessary and redundant tokens.Coupled with a new Variational Information Bottleneck learning strategy, the proposed system minimizes the reliance on potential indicators of architectures and optimization settings, for a better generalization of unseen architectures.We simulate the unseen architecture clone search scenarios and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a highly effective paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative training among different parties.Unlike traditional centralized learning, which requires collecting data from each party, FL allows clients to share privacy-preserving information without exposing private datasets.This approach not only guarantees enhanced privacy protection but also facilitates more efficient and secure collaboration among multiple participants.Therefore, FL has gained considerable attention from researchers, promoting numerous surveys to summarize the related works.However, the majority of these surveys concentrate on methods sharing model parameters during the training process, while overlooking the potential of sharing other forms of local information.In this paper, we present a systematic survey from a new perspective, i.e., what to share in FL, with an emphasis on the model utility, privacy leakage, and communication efficiency.This survey differs from previous ones due to four distinct contributions.First, we present a new taxonomy of FL methods in terms of the sharing methods, which includes three categories of shared information: model sharing, synthetic data sharing, and knowledge sharing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we analyze the vulnerability of different sharing methods to privacy attacks and review the defense mechanisms that provide certain privacy guarantees. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.795</span></span>Third, we conduct extensive experiments to compare the performance and communication overhead of various sharing methods in FL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, we assess the potential privacy leakage through model inversion and membership inference attacks, while comparing the effectiveness of various defense approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>Finally, we discuss potential deficiencies in current methods and outline future directions for improvement.</p>

                  <p>Existing customization methods require access to multiple reference examples to align pre-trained diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) with user-provided concepts.This paper aims to address the challenge of DPM customization when the only available supervision is a differentiable metric defined on the generated contents.Since the sampling procedure of DPMs involves recursive calls to the denoising UNet, na\"ive gradient backpropagation requires storing the intermediate states of all iterations, resulting in extremely high memory consumption.To overcome this issue, we propose a novel method AdjointDPM, which first generates new samples from diffusion models by solving the corresponding probability-flow ODEs.It then uses the adjoint sensitivity method to backpropagate the gradients of the loss to the models' parameters (including conditioning signals, network weights, and initial noises) by solving another augmented ODE.To reduce numerical errors in both the forward generation and gradient backpropagation processes, we further reparameterize the probability-flow ODE and augmented ODE as simple non-stiff ODEs using exponential integration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AdjointDPM on three interesting tasks: converting visual effects into identification text embeddings, finetuning DPMs for specific types of stylization, and optimizing initial noise to generate adversarial samples for security auditing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Collaborative inference has been a promising solution to enable resource-constrained edge devices to perform inference using state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs).In collaborative inference, the edge device first feeds the input to a partial DNN locally and then uploads the intermediate result to the cloud to complete the inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, recent research indicates model inversion attacks (MIAs) can reconstruct input data from intermediate results, posing serious privacy concerns for collaborative inference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>Existing perturbation and cryptography techniques are inefficient and unreliable in defending against MIAs while performing accurate inference.This paper provides a viable solution, named PATROL, which develops privacy-oriented pruning to balance privacy, efficiency, and utility of collaborative inference.PATROL takes advantage of the fact that later layers in a DNN can extract more task-specific features.Given limited local resources for collaborative inference, PATROL intends to deploy more layers at the edge based on pruning techniques to enforce task-specific features for inference and reduce task-irrelevant but sensitive features for privacy preservation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To achieve privacy-oriented pruning, PATROL introduces two key components: Lipschitz regularization and adversarial reconstruction training, which increase the reconstruction errors by reducing the stability of MIAs and enhance the target inference model by adversarial training, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span></p>
