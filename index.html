                  <p>Computational argumentation has become an essential tool in various fields, including artificial intelligence, law, and public policy.It is an emerging research field in natural language processing (NLP) that attracts increasing attention.Research on computational argumentation mainly involves two types of tasks: argument mining and argument generation.As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong abilities in understanding context and generating natural language, it is worthwhile to evaluate the performance of LLMs on various computational argumentation tasks.This work aims to embark on an assessment of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Flan models and LLaMA2 models, under zero-shot and few-shot settings within the realm of computational argumentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We organize existing tasks into 6 main classes and standardise the format of 14 open-sourced datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.882</span></span>In addition, we present a new benchmark dataset on counter speech generation, that aims to holistically evaluate the end-to-end performance of LLMs on argument mining and argument generation.Extensive experiments show that LLMs exhibit commendable performance across most of these datasets, demonstrating their capabilities in the field of argumentation.We also highlight the limitations in evaluating computational argumentation and provide suggestions for future research directions in this field.</p>

                  <p>Recent benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) have mostly focused on application-driven tasks such as complex reasoning and code generation, and this has led to a scarcity in purely linguistic evaluation of LLMs.Against this background, we introduce Multilingual Evaluation of Linguistic Acceptability -- MELA, the first multilingual benchmark on linguistic acceptability with 48K samples covering 10 languages from a diverse set of language families.We establish baselines of commonly used LLMs along with supervised models, and conduct cross-lingual transfer and multi-task learning experiments with XLM-R. In pursuit of multilingual interpretability, we analyze the weights of fine-tuned XLM-R to explore the possibility of identifying transfer difficulty between languages.Our results show that ChatGPT benefits much from in-context examples but still lags behind fine-tuned XLM-R, while the performance of GPT-4 is on par with fine-tuned XLM-R even in zero-shot setting.Cross-lingual and multi-task learning experiments show that unlike semantic tasks, in-language training data is crucial in acceptability judgements.Results in layerwise probing indicate that the upper layers of XLM-R become a task-specific but language-agnostic region for multilingual acceptability judgment.We also introduce the concept of conflicting weight, which could be a potential indicator for the difficulty of cross-lingual transfer between languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data will be available at https://github.com/sjtu-compling/MELA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the last decade, the United States has lost more than 500,000 people from an overdose involving prescription and illicit opioids (https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html) making it a national public health emergency (USDHHS, 2017).To more effectively prevent unintentional opioid overdoses, medical practitioners require robust and timely tools that can effectively identify at-risk patients.Community-based social media platforms such as Reddit allow self-disclosure for users to discuss otherwise sensitive drug-related behaviors, often acting as indicators for opioid use disorder.Towards this, we present a moderate size corpus of 2500 opioid-related posts from various subreddits spanning 6 different phases of opioid use: Medical Use, Misuse, Addiction, Recovery, Relapse, Not Using.For every post, we annotate span-level extractive explanations and crucially study their role both in annotation quality and model development.We evaluate several state-of-the-art models in a supervised, few-shot, or zero-shot setting.Experimental results and error analysis show that identifying the phases of opioid use disorder is highly contextual and challenging.However, we find that using explanations during modeling leads to a significant boost in classification accuracy demonstrating their beneficial role in a high-stakes domain such as studying the opioid use disorder continuum.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset will be made available for research on Github in the formal version. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span></p>

                  <p>A crucial reason for the success of existing NeRF-based methods is to build a neural density field for the geometry representation via multiple perceptron layers (MLPs).MLPs are continuous functions, however, real geometry or density field is frequently discontinuous at the interface between the air and the surface.Such a contrary brings the problem of unfaithful geometry representation.To this end, this paper proposes spiking NeRF, which leverages spiking neuron and a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-Spiking Neural Network (SNN) framework to build a discontinuous density field for faithful geometry representation.Specifically, we first demonstrate the reason why continuous density fields will bring inaccuracy.Then, we propose to use the spiking neurons to build a discontinuous density field.We conduct comprehensive analysis for the problem of existing spiking neuron models and then provide the numerical relationship between the parameter of spiking neuron and the theoretical accuracy of geometry, Based on this, we propose a bounded spiking neuron to build the discontinuous density field.Our results achieve SOTA performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be released to the public. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span></p>

                  <p>Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems aim to achieve specific goals through interactive dialogue.Such tasks usually involve following specific workflows, i.e. executing a sequence of actions in a particular order.While prior work has focused on supervised learning methods to condition on past actions, they do not explicitly optimize for compliance to a desired workflow.In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) to generate dialogue responses that are aligned with a given workflow.Our framework consists of ComplianceScorer, a metric designed to evaluate how well a generated response executes the specified action, combined with an RL opimization process that utilizes an interactive sampling technique.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach on two TOD datasets, Action-Based Conversations Dataset (ABCD) (Chen et al., 2021a) and MultiWOZ 2.2 (Zang et al., 2020) on a range of automated and human evaluation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>Our findings indicate that our RL-based framework outperforms baselines and is effective at enerating responses that both comply with the intended workflows while being expressed in a natural and fluent manner.</p>

                  <p>Context: An assurance case is a structured hierarchy of claims aiming at demonstrating that a given mission-critical system supports specific requirements (e.g., safety, security, privacy).The presence of assurance weakeners (i.e., assurance deficits, logical fallacies) in assurance cases reflects insufficient evidence, knowledge, or gaps in reasoning.These weakeners can undermine confidence in assurance arguments, potentially hindering the verification of mission-critical system capabilities.   Objectives:As a stepping stone for future research on assurance weakeners, we aim to initiate the first comprehensive systematic mapping study on this subject.Methods: We followed the well-established PRISMA 2020 and SEGRESS guidelines to conduct our systematic mapping study.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We searched for primary studies in five digital libraries and focused on the 2012-2023 publication year range. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>Our selection criteria focused on studies addressing assurance weakeners at the modeling level, resulting in the inclusion of 39 primary studies in our systematic review.   Results: Our systematic mapping study reports a taxonomy (map) that provides a uniform categorization of assurance weakeners and approaches proposed to manage them at the modeling level.   Conclusion: Our study findings suggest that the SACM (Structured Assurance Case Metamodel) -- a standard specified by the OMG (Object Management Group) -- may be the best specification to capture structured arguments and reason about their potential assurance weakeners.</p>

                  <p>Are Large language models (LLMs) temporally grounded?Since LLMs cannot perceive and interact with the environment, it is impossible to answer this question directly.Instead, we provide LLMs with textual narratives and probe them with respect to their common-sense knowledge of the structure and duration of events, their ability to order events along a timeline, and self-consistency within their temporal model (e.g., temporal relations such as after and before are mutually exclusive for any pair of events).We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs (such as LLaMA 2 and GPT-4) on three tasks reflecting these abilities.Generally, we find that LLMs lag significantly behind both human performance as well as small-scale, specialised LMs.In-context learning, instruction tuning, and chain-of-thought prompting reduce this gap only to a limited degree.Crucially, LLMs struggle the most with self-consistency, displaying incoherent behaviour in at least 27.23% of their predictions.Contrary to expectations, we also find that scaling the model size does not guarantee positive gains in performance.To explain these results, we study the sources from which LLMs may gather temporal information: we find that sentence ordering in unlabelled texts, available during pre-training, is only weakly correlated with event ordering.Moreover, public instruction tuning mixtures contain few temporal tasks.Hence, we conclude that current LLMs lack a consistent temporal model of textual narratives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, datasets, and LLM outputs are available at https://github.com/yfqiu-nlp/temporal-llms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been a rapid advancement in research on Large Language Models (LLMs), resulting in significant progress in several Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.Consequently, there has been a surge in LLM evaluation research to comprehend the models' capabilities and limitations.However, much of this research has been confined to the English language, leaving LLM building and evaluation for non-English languages relatively unexplored.There has been an introduction of several new LLMs, necessitating their evaluation on non-English languages.This study aims to expand our MEGA benchmarking suite by including six new datasets to form the MEGAVERSE benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The benchmark comprises 22 datasets covering 81 languages, including low-resource African languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT4, PaLM2, and Llama2 on the MEGAVERSE datasets.Additionally, we include two multimodal datasets in the benchmark and assess the performance of the LLaVa-v1.5 model.Our experiments suggest that GPT4 and PaLM2 outperform the Llama models on various tasks, notably on low-resource languages, with GPT4 outperforming PaLM2 on more datasets than vice versa.However, issues such as data contamination must be addressed to obtain an accurate assessment of LLM performance on non-English languages.</p>

                  <p>3D content creation via text-driven stylization has played a fundamental challenge to multimedia and graphics community.Recent advances of cross-modal foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have made this problem feasible.Those approaches commonly leverage CLIP to align the holistic semantics of stylized mesh with the given text prompt.Nevertheless, it is not trivial to enable more controllable stylization of fine-grained details in 3D meshes solely based on such semantic-level cross-modal supervision.In this work, we propose a new 3DStyle-Diffusion model that triggers fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes with additional controllable appearance and geometric guidance from 2D Diffusion models.Technically, 3DStyle-Diffusion first parameterizes the texture of 3D mesh into reflectance properties and scene lighting using implicit MLP networks.Meanwhile, an accurate depth map of each sampled view is achieved conditioned on 3D mesh.Then, 3DStyle-Diffusion leverages a pre-trained controllable 2D Diffusion model to guide the learning of rendered images, encouraging the synthesized image of each view semantically aligned with text prompt and geometrically consistent with depth map.This way elegantly integrates both image rendering via implicit MLP networks and diffusion process of image synthesis in an end-to-end fashion, enabling a high-quality fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also build a new dataset derived from Objaverse and the evaluation protocol for this task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we validate the capability of our 3DStyle-Diffusion.Source code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/yanghb22-fdu/3DStyle-Diffusion-Official}.</p>

                  <p>Identifying root causes for unexpected or undesirable behavior in complex systems is a prevalent challenge.This issue becomes especially crucial in modern cloud applications that employ numerous microservices.Although the machine learning and systems research communities have proposed various techniques to tackle this problem, there is currently a lack of standardized datasets for quantitative benchmarking.Consequently, research groups are compelled to create their own datasets for experimentation.This paper introduces a dataset specifically designed for evaluating root cause analyses in microservice-based applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset encompasses latency, requests, and availability metrics emitted in 5-minute intervals from a distributed application. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>In addition to normal operation metrics, the dataset includes 68 injected performance issues, which increase latency and reduce availability throughout the system.We showcase how this dataset can be used to evaluate the accuracy of a variety of methods spanning different causal and non-causal characterisations of the root cause analysis problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope the new dataset, available at https://github.com/amazon-science/petshop-root-cause-analysis/ enables further development of techniques in this important area. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently proposed long-form question answering (QA) systems, supported by large language models (LLMs), have shown promising capabilities.Yet, attributing and verifying their generated abstractive answers can be difficult, and automatically evaluating their accuracy remains an ongoing challenge.   In this work, we introduce a new QA task for answering multi-answer questions by summarizing multiple diverse sources in a semi-extractive fashion.Specifically, Semi-extractive Multi-source QA (SEMQA) requires models to output a comprehensive answer, while mixing factual quoted spans -- copied verbatim from given input sources -- and non-factual free-text connectors that glue these spans together into a single cohesive passage.This setting bridges the gap between the outputs of well-grounded but constrained extractive QA systems and more fluent but harder to attribute fully abstractive answers.Particularly, it enables a new mode for language models that leverages their advanced language generation capabilities, while also producing fine in-line attributions by-design that are easy to verify, interpret, and evaluate.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To study this task, we create the first dataset of this kind, QuoteSum, with human-written semi-extractive answers to natural and generated questions, and define text-based evaluation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span>Experimenting with several LLMs in various settings, we find this task to be surprisingly challenging, demonstrating the importance of QuoteSum for developing and studying such consolidation capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Recently, pretrained language models have shown state-of-the-art performance on the vulnerability detection task.These models are pretrained on a large corpus of source code, then fine-tuned on a smaller supervised vulnerability dataset.Due to the different training objectives and the performance of the models, it is interesting to consider whether the models have learned the semantics of code relevant to vulnerability detection, namely bug semantics, and if so, how the alignment to bug semantics relates to model performance.In this paper, we analyze the models using three distinct methods: interpretability tools, attention analysis, and interaction matrix analysis.We compare the models' influential feature sets with the bug semantic features which define the causes of bugs, including buggy paths and Potentially Vulnerable Statements (PVS).We find that (1) better-performing models also aligned better with PVS, (2) the models failed to align strongly to PVS, and (3) the models failed to align at all to buggy paths.Based on our analysis, we developed two annotation methods which highlight the bug semantics inside the model's inputs.We evaluated our approach on four distinct transformer models and four vulnerability datasets and found that our annotations improved the models' performance in the majority of settings - 11 out of 16, with up to 9.57 points improvement in F1 score compared to conventional fine-tuning.We further found that with our annotations, the models aligned up to 232% better to potentially vulnerable statements.Our findings indicate that it is helpful to provide the model with information of the bug semantics, that the model can attend to it, and motivate future work in learning more complex path-based bug semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at https://figshare.com/s/4a16a528d6874aad51a0. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models to the vision domain.Initial efforts towards LMMs used holistic images and text prompts to generate ungrounded textual responses.Very recently, region-level LMMs have been used to generate visually grounded responses.However, they are limited to only referring a single object category at a time, require users to specify the regions in inputs, or cannot offer dense pixel-wise object grounding.In this work, we present Grounding LMM (GLaMM), the first model that can generate natural language responses seamlessly intertwined with corresponding object segmentation masks.GLaMM not only grounds objects appearing in the conversations but is flexible enough to accept both textual and optional visual prompts (region of interest) as input.This empowers users to interact with the model at various levels of granularity, both in textual and visual domains.Due to the lack of standard benchmarks for the novel setting of generating visually grounded detailed conversations, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol with our curated grounded conversations.Our proposed Grounded Conversation Generation (GCG) task requires densely grounded concepts in natural scenes at a large-scale.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we propose a densely annotated Grounding-anything Dataset (GranD) using our proposed automated annotation pipeline that encompasses 7.5M unique concepts grounded in a total of 810M regions available with segmentation masks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>Besides GCG, GLaMM also performs effectively on several downstream tasks e.g., referring expression segmentation, image and region-level captioning and vision-language conversations.Project Page: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/groundingLMM.</p>

                  <p>Recently, pretrained language models have shown state-of-the-art performance on the vulnerability detection task.These models are pretrained on a large corpus of source code, then fine-tuned on a smaller supervised vulnerability dataset.Due to the different training objectives and the performance of the models, it is interesting to consider whether the models have learned the semantics of code relevant to vulnerability detection, namely bug semantics, and if so, how the alignment to bug semantics relates to model performance.In this paper, we analyze the models using three distinct methods: interpretability tools, attention analysis, and interaction matrix analysis.We compare the models' influential feature sets with the bug semantic features which define the causes of bugs, including buggy paths and Potentially Vulnerable Statements (PVS).We find that (1) better-performing models also aligned better with PVS, (2) the models failed to align strongly to PVS, and (3) the models failed to align at all to buggy paths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on our analysis, we developed two annotation methods which highlight the bug semantics inside the model's inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>We evaluated our approach on four distinct transformer models and four vulnerability datasets and found that our annotations improved the models' performance in the majority of settings - 11 out of 16, with up to 9.57 points improvement in F1 score compared to conventional fine-tuning.We further found that with our annotations, the models aligned up to 232% better to potentially vulnerable statements.Our findings indicate that it is helpful to provide the model with information of the bug semantics, that the model can attend to it, and motivate future work in learning more complex path-based bug semantics.Our code and data are available at https://figshare.com/s/4a16a528d6874aad51a0.</p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, either improving existing recommendation models or serving as the backbone.However, there exists a large semantic gap between LLMs and recommender systems, since items to be recommended are often indexed by discrete identifiers (item ID) out of the LLM's vocabulary.In essence, LLMs capture language semantics while recommender systems imply collaborative semantics, making it difficult to sufficiently leverage the model capacity of LLMs for recommendation.To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a new LLM-based recommendation model called LC-Rec, which can better integrate language and collaborative semantics for recommender systems.Our approach can directly generate items from the entire item set for recommendation, without relying on candidate items.Specifically, we make two major contributions in our approach.For item indexing, we design a learning-based vector quantization method with uniform semantic mapping, which can assign meaningful and non-conflicting IDs (called item indices) for items.For alignment tuning, we propose a series of specially designed tuning tasks to enhance the integration of collaborative semantics in LLMs.Our fine-tuning tasks enforce LLMs to deeply integrate language and collaborative semantics (characterized by the learned item indices), so as to achieve an effective adaptation to recommender systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing that our approach can outperform a number of competitive baselines including traditional recommenders and existing LLM-based recommenders. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/LC-Rec/.</p>

                  <p>Recent research has shown that transformer networks can be used as differentiable search indexes by representing each document as a sequences of document ID tokens.These generative retrieval models cast the retrieval problem to a document ID generation problem for each given query.Despite their elegant design, existing generative retrieval models only perform well on artificially-constructed and small-scale collections.This has led to serious skepticism in the research community on their real-world impact.This paper represents an important milestone in generative retrieval research by showing, for the first time, that generative retrieval models can be trained to perform effectively on large-scale standard retrieval benchmarks.For doing so, we propose RIPOR-an optimization framework for generative retrieval that can be adopted by any encoder-decoder architecture.RIPOR is designed based on two often-overlooked fundamental design considerations in generative retrieval.First, given the sequential decoding nature of document ID generation, assigning accurate relevance scores to documents based on the whole document ID sequence is not sufficient.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, RIPOR introduces a novel prefix-oriented ranking optimization algorithm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Second, initial document IDs should be constructed based on relevance associations between queries and documents, instead of the syntactic and semantic information in the documents.RIPOR addresses this issue using a relevance-based document ID construction approach that quantizes relevance-based representations learned for documents.Evaluation on MSMARCO and TREC Deep Learning Track reveals that RIPOR surpasses state-of-the-art generative retrieval models by a large margin (e.g., 30.5% MRR improvements on MS MARCO Dev Set), and perform better on par with popular dense retrieval models.</p>

                  <p>We revisit the problem of efficiently learning the underlying parameters of Ising models from data.Current algorithmic approaches achieve essentially optimal sample complexity when given i.i.d. samples from the stationary measure and the underlying model satisfies "width" bounds on the total $\ell_1$ interaction involving each node.We show that a simple existing approach based on node-wise logistic regression provably succeeds at recovering the underlying model in several new settings where these assumptions are violated:   (1) Given dynamically generated data from a wide variety of local Markov chains, like block or round-robin dynamics, logistic regression recovers the parameters with optimal sample complexity up to $\log\log n$ factors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This generalizes the specialized algorithm of Bresler, Gamarnik, and <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Shah [IEEE Trans.Inf.Theory'18] for structure recovery in bounded degree graphs from Glauber dynamics.   (2) For the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin glasses, given $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ independent samples, logistic regression recovers the parameters in most of the known high-temperature regime via a simple reduction to weaker structural properties of the measure.This improves on recent work of Anari, Jain, Koehler, Pham, and Vuong[ArXiv'23] which gives distribution learning at higher temperature.   (3) As a simple byproduct of our techniques, logistic regression achieves an exponential improvement in learning from samples in the M-regime of data considered by Dutt, Lokhov, Vuffray, and Misra[ICML'21] as well as novel guarantees for learning from the adversarial Glauber dynamics of Chin, Moitra, Mossel, and Sandon [ArXiv'23].   Our approach thus significantly generalizes the elegant analysis of Wu, Sanghavi, and Dimakis[Neurips'19] without any algorithmic modification.</p>

                  <p>Comparative reasoning plays a crucial role in text preference prediction; however, large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies in their reasoning.While approaches like Chain-of-Thought improve accuracy in many other settings, they struggle to consistently distinguish the similarities and differences of complex texts.We introduce SC, a prompting approach that predicts text preferences by generating structured intermediate comparisons.SC begins by proposing aspects of comparison, followed by generating textual comparisons under each aspect.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We select consistent comparisons with a pairwise consistency comparator that ensures each aspect's comparisons clearly distinguish differences between texts, significantly reducing hallucination and improving consistency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Our comprehensive evaluations across various NLP tasks, including summarization, retrieval, and automatic rating, demonstrate that SC equips LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance in text preference prediction.</p>

                  <p>Text-based Person Search (TBPS) aims to retrieve images of target pedestrian indicated by textual descriptions.It is essential for TBPS to extract fine-grained local features and align them crossing modality.Existing methods utilize external tools or heavy cross-modal interaction to achieve explicit alignment of cross-modal fine-grained features, which is inefficient and time-consuming.In this work, we propose a Vision-Guided Semantic-Group Network (VGSG) for text-based person search to extract well-aligned fine-grained visual and textual features.In the proposed VGSG, we develop a Semantic-Group Textual Learning (SGTL) module and a Vision-guided Knowledge Transfer (VGKT) module to extract textual local features under the guidance of visual local clues.In SGTL, in order to obtain the local textual representation, we group textual features from the channel dimension based on the semantic cues of language expression, which encourages similar semantic patterns to be grouped implicitly without external tools.In VGKT, a vision-guided attention is employed to extract visual-related textual features, which are inherently aligned with visual cues and termed vision-guided textual features.Furthermore, we design a relational knowledge transfer, including a vision-language similarity transfer and a class probability transfer, to adaptively propagate information of the vision-guided textual features to semantic-group textual features.With the help of relational knowledge transfer, VGKT is capable of aligning semantic-group textual features with corresponding visual features without external tools and complex pairwise interaction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent approaches have explored language-guided classifiers capable of classifying examples from novel tasks when provided with task-specific natural language explanations, instructions or prompts (Sanh et al., 2022; R. Menon et al., 2022).While these classifiers can generalize in zero-shot settings, their task performance often varies substantially between different language explanations in unpredictable ways (Lu et al., 2022; Gonen et al., 2022).Also, current approaches fail to leverage unlabeled examples that may be available in many scenarios.Here, we introduce TALC, a framework that uses data programming to adapt a language-guided classifier for a new task during inference when provided with explanations from multiple teachers and unlabeled test examples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that TALC consistently outperforms a competitive baseline from prior work by an impressive 9.3% (relative improvement). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>Further, we demonstrate the robustness of TALC to variations in the quality and quantity of provided explanations, highlighting its potential in scenarios where learning from multiple teachers or a crowd is involved.Our code is available at: https://github.com/WeiKangda/TALC.git.</p>

                  <p>Current approaches for collision avoidance and space traffic management face many challenges, mainly due to the continuous increase in the number of objects in orbit and the lack of scalable and automated solutions.To avoid catastrophic incidents, satellite owners/operators must be aware of their assets' collision risk to decide whether a collision avoidance manoeuvre needs to be performed.This process is typically executed through the use of warnings issued in the form of CDMs which contain information about the event, such as the expected TCA and the probability of collision.Our previous work presented a statistical learning model that allowed us to answer two important questions: (1) Will any new conjunctions be issued in the next specified time interval?(2) When and with what uncertainty will the next CDM arrive?However, the model was based on an empirical Bayes homogeneous Poisson process, which assumes that the arrival rates of CDMs are constant over time.In fact, the rate at which the CDMs are issued depends on the behaviour of the objects as well as on the screening process performed by third parties.Thus, in this work, we extend the previous study and propose a Bayesian non-homogeneous Poisson process implemented with high precision using a Probabilistic Programming Language to fully describe the underlying phenomena.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare the proposed solution with a baseline model to demonstrate the added value of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>The results show that this problem can be successfully modelled by our Bayesian non-homogeneous Poisson Process with greater accuracy, contributing to the development of automated collision avoidance systems and helping operators react timely but sparingly with satellite manoeuvres.</p>

                  <p>Mixup refers to interpolation-based data augmentation, originally motivated as a way to go beyond empirical risk minimization (ERM).Its extensions mostly focus on the definition of interpolation and the space (input or feature) where it takes place, while the augmentation process itself is less studied.In most methods, the number of generated examples is limited to the mini-batch size and the number of examples being interpolated is limited to two (pairs), in the input space.   We make progress in this direction by introducing MultiMix, which generates an arbitrarily large number of interpolated examples beyond the mini-batch size and interpolates the entire mini-batch in the embedding space.Effectively, we sample on the entire convex hull of the mini-batch rather than along linear segments between pairs of examples.   On sequence data, we further extend to Dense MultiMix.We densely interpolate features and target labels at each spatial location and also apply the loss densely.To mitigate the lack of dense labels, we inherit labels from examples and weight interpolation factors by attention as a measure of confidence.   Overall, we increase the number of loss terms per mini-batch by orders of magnitude at little additional cost.This is only possible because of interpolating in the embedding space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We empirically show that our solutions yield significant improvement over state-of-the-art mixup methods on four different benchmarks, despite interpolation being only linear. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>By analyzing the embedding space, we show that the classes are more tightly clustered and uniformly spread over the embedding space, thereby explaining the improved behavior.</p>

                  <p>Contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising approach for learning data representations that discover and disentangle the explanatory factors of the data.Previous analyses of such approaches have largely focused on individual contrastive losses, such as noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) and InfoNCE, and rely on specific assumptions about the data generating process.This paper extends the theoretical guarantees for disentanglement to a broader family of contrastive methods, while also relaxing the assumptions about the data distribution.Specifically, we prove identifiability of the true latents for four contrastive losses studied in this paper, without imposing common independence assumptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The theoretical findings are validated on several benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>Finally, practical limitations of these methods are also investigated.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, computer vision has transformed fields such as medical imaging, object recognition, and geospatial analytics.One of the fundamental tasks in computer vision is semantic image segmentation, which is vital for precise object delineation.Autonomous driving represents one of the key areas where computer vision algorithms are applied.The task of road surface segmentation is crucial in self-driving systems, but it requires a labor-intensive annotation process in several data domains.The work described in this paper aims to improve the efficiency of image segmentation using a convolutional neural network in a multi-sensor setup.This approach leverages lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) annotations to directly train image segmentation models on RGB images.Lidar supplements the images by emitting laser pulses and measuring reflections to provide depth information.However, lidar's sparse point clouds often create difficulties for accurate object segmentation.Segmentation of point clouds requires time-consuming preliminary data preparation and a large amount of computational resources.The key innovation of our approach is the masked loss, addressing sparse ground-truth masks from point clouds.By calculating loss exclusively where lidar points exist, the model learns road segmentation on images by using lidar points as ground truth.This approach allows for blending of different ground-truth data types during model training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental validation of the approach on benchmark datasets shows comparable performance to a high-quality image segmentation model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Incorporating lidar reduces the load on annotations and enables training of image-segmentation models without loss of segmentation quality.The methodology is tested on diverse datasets, both publicly available and proprietary.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method are also discussed in the paper. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span></p>

                  <p>Tucker decomposition is a powerful tensor model to handle multi-aspect data.It demonstrates the low-rank property by decomposing the grid-structured data as interactions between a core tensor and a set of object representations (factors).A fundamental assumption of such decomposition is that there were finite objects in each aspect or mode, corresponding to discrete indexes of data entries.However, many real-world data are not naturally posed in the setting.For example, geographic data is represented as continuous indexes of latitude and longitude coordinates, and cannot fit tensor models directly.To generalize Tucker decomposition to such scenarios, we propose Functional Bayesian Tucker Decomposition (FunBaT).We treat the continuous-indexed data as the interaction between the Tucker core and a group of latent functions.We use Gaussian processes (GP) as functional priors to model the latent functions, and then convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE) to reduce computational cost.An efficient inference algorithm is further developed for scalable posterior approximation based on advanced message-passing techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The advantage of our method is shown in both synthetic data and several real-world applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>Semi-structured tables are ubiquitous.There has been a variety of tasks that aim to automatically interpret, augment, and query tables.Current methods often require pretraining on tables or special model architecture design, are restricted to specific table types, or have simplifying assumptions about tables and tasks.This paper makes the first step towards developing open-source large language models (LLMs) as generalists for a diversity of table-based tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Towards that end, we construct TableInstruct, a new dataset with a variety of realistic tables and tasks, for instruction tuning and evaluating LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>We further develop the first open-source generalist model for tables, TableLlama, by fine-tuning Llama 2 (7B) with LongLoRA to address the long context challenge.We experiment under both in-domain setting and out-of-domain setting.On 7 out of 8 in-domain tasks, TableLlama achieves comparable or better performance than the SOTA for each task, despite the latter often has task-specific design.On 6 out-of-domain datasets, it achieves 6-48 absolute point gains compared with the base model, showing that training on TableInstruct enhances the model's generalizability.We will open-source our dataset and trained model to boost future work on developing open generalist models for tables.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) represent a substantial advancement in the capabilities of large language models, notably in reducing factual hallucination by leveraging external knowledge sources.However, the reliability of the retrieved information is not always guaranteed.The retrieval of irrelevant data can lead to misguided responses, and potentially causing the model to overlook its inherent knowledge, even when it possesses adequate information to address the query.Moreover, standard RALMs often struggle to assess whether they possess adequate knowledge, both intrinsic and retrieved, to provide an accurate answer.In situations where knowledge is lacking, these systems should ideally respond with "unknown" when the answer is unattainable.In response to these challenges, we introduces Chain-of-Noting (CoN), a novel approach aimed at improving the robustness of RALMs in facing noisy, irrelevant documents and in handling unknown scenarios.The core idea of CoN is to generate sequential reading notes for retrieved documents, enabling a thorough evaluation of their relevance to the given question and integrating this information to formulate the final answer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We employed ChatGPT to create training data for CoN, which was subsequently trained on an LLaMa-2 7B model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Our experiments across four open-domain QA benchmarks show that RALMs equipped with CoN significantly outperform standard RALMs.Notably, CoN achieves an average improvement of +7.9 in EM score given entirely noisy retrieved documents and +10.5 in rejection rates for real-time questions that fall outside the pre-training knowledge scope.</p>
