                  <p>Multi-tenancy in public clouds may lead to co-location interference on shared resources, which possibly results in performance degradation of cloud applications.Cloud providers want to know when such events happen and how serious the degradation is, to perform interference-aware migrations and alleviate the problem.However, virtual machines (VM) in Infrastructure-as-a-Service public clouds are black-boxes to providers, where application-level performance information cannot be acquired.This makes performance monitoring intensely challenging as cloud providers can only rely on low-level metrics such as CPU usage and hardware counters.   We propose a novel machine learning framework, Alioth, to monitor the performance degradation of cloud applications.To feed the data-hungry models, we first elaborate interference generators and conduct comprehensive co-location experiments on a testbed to build Alioth-dataset which reflects the complexity and dynamicity in real-world scenarios.Then we construct Alioth by (1) augmenting features via recovering low-level metrics under no interference using denoising auto-encoders, (2) devising a transfer learning model based on domain adaptation neural network to make models generalize on test cases unseen in offline training, and (3) developing a SHAP explainer to automate feature selection and enhance model interpretability.Experiments show that Alioth achieves an average mean absolute error of 5.29% offline and 10.8% when testing on applications unseen in the training stage, outperforming the baseline methods.Alioth is also robust in signaling quality-of-service violation under dynamicity.Finally, we demonstrate a possible application of Alioth's interpretability, providing insights to benefit the decision-making of cloud operators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code of Alioth have been released on GitHub.</span></p>

                  <p>The goal of Text-to-image person retrieval is to retrieve person images from a large gallery that match the given textual descriptions.The main challenge of this task lies in the significant differences in information representation between the visual and textual modalities.The textual modality conveys abstract and precise information through vocabulary and grammatical structures, while the visual modality conveys concrete and intuitive information through images.To fully leverage the expressive power of textual representations, it is essential to accurately map abstract textual descriptions to specific images.   To address this issue, we propose a novel framework to Unleash the Imagination of Text (UIT) in text-to-image person retrieval, aiming to fully explore the power of words in sentences.Specifically, the framework employs the pre-trained full CLIP model as a dual encoder for the images and texts , taking advantage of prior cross-modal alignment knowledge.The Text-guided Image Restoration auxiliary task is proposed with the aim of implicitly mapping abstract textual entities to specific image regions, facilitating alignment between textual and visual embeddings.Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal triplet loss tailored for handling hard samples, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish minor differences.   To focus the model on the key components within sentences, we propose a novel text data augmentation technique.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results on three popular benchmark datasets, and the source code will be made publicly available shortly.</span></p>

                  <p>In safety-critical classification tasks, conformal prediction allows to perform rigorous uncertainty quantification by providing confidence sets including the true class with a user-specified probability.This generally assumes the availability of a held-out calibration set with access to ground truth labels.Unfortunately, in many domains, such labels are difficult to obtain and usually approximated by aggregating expert opinions.In fact, this holds true for almost all datasets, including well-known ones such as CIFAR and ImageNet.Applying conformal prediction using such labels underestimates uncertainty.Indeed, when expert opinions are not resolvable, there is inherent ambiguity present in the labels.That is, we do not have ``crisp'', definitive ground truth labels and this uncertainty should be taken into account during calibration.In this paper, we develop a conformal prediction framework for such ambiguous ground truth settings which relies on an approximation of the underlying posterior distribution of labels given inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate our methodology on synthetic and real datasets, including a case study of skin condition classification in dermatology.</span></p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Trajectory data collection is a common task with many applications in our daily lives.</span>Analyzing trajectory data enables service providers to enhance their services, which ultimately benefits users.However, directly collecting trajectory data may give rise to privacy-related issues that cannot be ignored.Local differential privacy (LDP), as the de facto privacy protection standard in a decentralized setting, enables users to perturb their trajectories locally and provides a provable privacy guarantee.Existing approaches to private trajectory data collection in a local setting typically use relaxed versions of LDP, which cannot provide a strict privacy guarantee, or require some external knowledge that is impractical to obtain and update in a timely manner.To tackle these problems, we propose a novel trajectory perturbation mechanism that relies solely on an underlying location set and satisfies pure $\epsilon$-LDP to provide a stringent privacy guarantee.In the proposed mechanism, each point's adjacent direction information in the trajectory is used in its perturbation process.Such information serves as an effective clue to connect neighboring points and can be used to restrict the possible region of a perturbed point in order to enhance utility.To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to use direction information for trajectory perturbation under LDP.Furthermore, based on this mechanism, we present an anchor-based method that adaptively restricts the region of each perturbed trajectory, thereby significantly boosting performance without violating the privacy constraint.Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms.</p>

                  <p>Researchers have invested considerable effort into ensuring that large language models (LLMs) align with human values, using various training techniques, such as instruction tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human or AI Feedback (RLHF/RLAIF), to guard against text unsafety.However, these defenses remain incredibly vulnerable to some jailbreak attacks, which can cause the model to become overly defensive to sensitive topics or still generate harmful content, leaving the model performance particularly fragile.Therefore, to comprehensively study text safety and output robustness, we propose a latent jailbreak prompt dataset, each involving malicious instruction embedding.Specifically, we instruct the model to complete a regular task, such as translation, where the text to be translated contains malicious instructions.To further analyze the safety and robustness, we design a hierarchical annotation framework.We present a systematic analysis of the safety and robustness of LLMs concerning the position of explicit normal instructions, word replacement (verbs in explicit normal instructions, target groups in malicious instructions, cue words in malicious instructions), and instruction replacement (different explicit normal instructions).Our results show that current LLMs not only have a preference for certain instruction verbs, but also exhibit different jailbreak rates for different instruction verbs in explicit normal instructions.In other words, the probability of generating unsafe content by the model will be reinforced to varying degrees depending on the instruction verb in explicit normal instructions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/qiuhuachuan/latent-jailbreak.</span></p>

                  <p>We propose the In-context Autoencoder (ICAE) for context compression in a large language model (LLM).The ICAE has two modules: a learnable encoder adapted with LoRA from an LLM for compressing a long context into a limited number of memory slots, and a fixed decoder which is the target LLM that can condition on the memory slots for various purposes.We first pretrain the ICAE using both autoencoding and language modeling objectives on massive text data, enabling it to generate memory slots that accurately and comprehensively represent the original context.Then, we fine-tune the pretrained ICAE on a small amount of instruct data to enhance its interaction with various prompts for producing desirable responses.Our experimental results demonstrate that the ICAE learned with our proposed pretraining and fine-tuning paradigm can effectively produce memory slots with $4\times$ context compression, which can be well conditioned on by the target LLM to respond to various prompts.The promising results demonstrate significant implications of the ICAE for its novel approach to the long context problem and its potential to reduce computation and memory overheads for LLM inference in practice, suggesting further research effort in context management for an LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be released shortly.</span></p>

                  <p>Python is a popular dynamic programming language, evidenced by its ranking as the second most commonly used language on GitHub.However, its dynamic type system can lead to potential type errors, leading researchers to explore automatic type inference approaches for Python programs.The rule-based type inference approaches can ensure the accuracy of predicted variable types, but they suffer from low coverage problems.Supervised type inference approaches, while feature-agnostic, require large, high-quality annotated datasets and are limited to pre-defined types.As zero-shot approaches, the cloze-style approaches reformulate the type inference problem into a fill-in-the-blank problem.However, their performance is limited.   This paper introduces TypeGen, a few-shot generative type inference approach that incorporates static domain knowledge from static analysis.TypeGen creates chain-of-thought (COT) prompts by translating the type inference steps of static analysis into prompts based on the type dependency graphs (TDGs), enabling language models to learn from how static analysis infers types.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By combining COT prompts with code slices and type hints, TypeGen constructs example prompts from human annotations.</span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TypeGen only requires very few annotated examples to teach language models to generate similar COT prompts via in-context learning.</span>Moreover, TypeGen enhances the interpretability of results through the use of the input-explanation-output strategy.Experiments show that TypeGen outperforms the best baseline Type4Py by 10.0% for argument type prediction and 22.5% in return value type prediction in terms of top-1 Exact Match by using only five examples.Furthermore, TypeGen achieves substantial improvements of 27% to 84% compared to the zero-shot performance of large language models with parameter sizes ranging from 1.3B to 175B in terms of top-1 Exact Match.</p>

                  <p>Developers often face challenges in code understanding, which is crucial for building and maintaining high-quality software systems.Code comments and documentation can provide some context for the code, but are often scarce or missing.This challenge has become even more pressing with the rise of large language model (LLM) based code generation tools.To understand unfamiliar code, most software developers rely on general-purpose search engines to search through various programming information resources, which often requires multiple iterations of query rewriting and information foraging.More recently, developers have turned to online chatbots powered by LLMs, such as ChatGPT, which can provide more customized responses but also incur more overhead as developers need to communicate a significant amount of context to the LLM via a textual interface.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we provide the investigation of an LLM-based conversational UI in the IDE.</span>We aim to understand the promises and obstacles for tools powered by LLMs that are contextually aware, in that they automatically leverage the developer's programming context to answer queries.To this end, we develop an IDE Plugin that allows users to query back-ends such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with high-level requests, like: explaining a highlighted section of code, explaining key domain-specific terms, or providing usage examples for an API.We conduct an exploratory user study with 32 participants to understand the usefulness and effectiveness, as well as individual preferences in the usage of, this LLM-powered information support tool.The study confirms that this approach can aid code understanding more effectively than web search, but the degree of the benefit differed by participants' experience levels.</p>

We implemented two metrics based on counterfactual simulatability: precision and generality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We generated diverse counterfactuals automatically using LLMs.</span>We then used these metrics to evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) on two tasks: multi-hop factual reasoning and reward modeling.We found that LLM's explanations have low precision and that precision does not correlate with plausibility.Therefore, naively optimizing human approvals (e.g., RLHF) may not be a sufficient solution.</p>

                  <p>There is a strong incentive to develop computational pathology models to i) ease the burden of tissue typology annotation from whole slide histological images; ii) transfer knowledge, e.g., tissue class separability from the withheld source domain to the distributionally shifted unlabeled target domain, and simultaneously iii) detect Open Set samples, i.e., unseen novel categories not present in the training source domain.This paper proposes a highly practical setting by addressing the abovementioned challenges in one fell swoop, i.e., source-free Open Set domain adaptation (SF-OSDA), which addresses the situation where a model pre-trained on the inaccessible source dataset can be adapted on the unlabeled target dataset containing Open Set samples.The central tenet of our proposed method is distilling knowledge from a self-supervised vision transformer trained in the target domain.We propose a novel style-based data augmentation used as hard positives for self-training a vision transformer in the target domain, yielding strongly contextualized embedding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, semantically similar target images are clustered while the source model provides their corresponding weak pseudo-labels with unreliable confidence.</span>Furthermore, we propose cluster relative maximum logit score (CRMLS) to rectify the confidence of the weak pseudo-labels and compute weighted class prototypes in the contextualized embedding space that are utilized for adapting the source model on the target domain.Our method significantly outperforms the previous methods, including open set detection, test-time adaptation, and SF-OSDA methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on three public histopathological datasets of colorectal cancer (CRC) assessment-Kather-16, Kather-19, and CRCTP.Our code is available at https://github.com/LTS5/Proto-SF-OSDA.</p>

                  <p>Medical image classification is a challenging task due to the scarcity of labeled samples and class imbalance caused by the high variance in disease prevalence.Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods can mitigate these challenges by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data.However, SSL methods for medical image classification need to address two key challenges: (1) estimating reliable pseudo-labels for the images in the unlabeled dataset and (2) reducing biases caused by class imbalance.In this paper, we propose a novel SSL approach, SPLAL, that effectively addresses these challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SPLAL leverages class prototypes and a weighted combination of classifiers to predict reliable pseudo-labels over a subset of unlabeled images.</span>Additionally, we introduce alignment loss to mitigate model biases toward majority classes.To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we conduct experiments on two publicly available medical image classification benchmark datasets: the skin lesion classification (ISIC 2018) and the blood cell classification dataset (BCCD).The experimental results empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art SSL methods over various evaluation metrics.Specifically, our proposed approach achieves a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art approach on the ISIC 2018 dataset in both Accuracy and F1 score, with relative margins of 2.24\% and 11.40\%, respectively.Finally, we conduct extensive ablation experiments to examine the contribution of different components of our approach, validating its effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Developers often face challenges in code understanding, which is crucial for building and maintaining high-quality software systems.Code comments and documentation can provide some context for the code, but are often scarce or missing.This challenge has become even more pressing with the rise of large language model (LLM) based code generation tools.To understand unfamiliar code, most software developers rely on general-purpose search engines to search through various programming information resources, which often requires multiple iterations of query rewriting and information foraging.More recently, developers have turned to online chatbots powered by LLMs, such as ChatGPT, which can provide more customized responses but also incur more overhead as developers need to communicate a significant amount of context to the LLM via a textual interface.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we provide the investigation of an LLM-based conversational UI in the IDE.</span>We aim to understand the promises and obstacles for tools powered by LLMs that are contextually aware, in that they automatically leverage the developer's programming context to answer queries.To this end, we develop an IDE Plugin that allows users to query back-ends such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with high-level requests, like: explaining a highlighted section of code, explaining key domain-specific terms, or providing usage examples for an API.We conduct an exploratory user study with 32 participants to understand the usefulness and effectiveness, as well as individual preferences in the usage of, this LLM-powered information support tool.The study confirms that this approach can aid code understanding more effectively than web search, but the degree of the benefit differed by participants' experience levels.</p>

                  <p>Wireless networks are vulnerable to physical layer spoofing attacks due to the wireless broadcast nature, thus, integrating communications and security (ICAS) is urgently needed for 6G endogenous security.In this letter, we propose an environment semantics enabled physical layer authentication network based on deep learning, namely EsaNet, to authenticate the spoofing from the underlying wireless protocol.Specifically, the frequency independent wireless channel fingerprint (FiFP) is extracted from the channel state information (CSI) of a massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system based on environment semantics knowledge.Then, we transform the received signal into a two-dimensional red green blue (RGB) image and apply the you only look once (YOLO), a single-stage object detection network, to quickly capture the FiFP.Next, a lightweight classification network is designed to distinguish the legitimate from the illegitimate users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed EsaNet can effectively detect physical layer spoofing attacks and is robust in time-varying wireless environments.</span></p>

                  <p>It is universally acknowledged that Wi-Fi communications are important to secure.Thus, the Wi-Fi Alliance published WPA3 in 2018 with a distinctive security feature: it leverages a Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol to protect users' passwords from offline dictionary attacks.Unfortunately, soon after its release, several attacks were reported against its implementations, in response to which the protocol was updated in a best-effort manner.   In this paper, we show that the proposed mitigations are not enough, especially for a complex protocol to implement even for savvy developers.Indeed, we present **Dragondoom**, a collection of side-channel vulnerabilities of varying strength allowing attackers to recover users' passwords in widely deployed Wi-Fi daemons, such as hostap in its default settings.Our findings target both password conversion methods, namely the default probabilistic hunting-and-pecking and its newly standardized deterministic alternative based on SSWU.We successfully exploit our leakage in practice through microarchitectural mechanisms, and overcome the limited spatial resolution of Flush+Reload.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our attacks outperform previous works in terms of required measurements.   </span>Then, driven by the need to end the spiral of patch-and-hack in Dragonfly implementations, we propose **Dragonstar**, an implementation of Dragonfly leveraging a formally verified implementation of the underlying mathematical operations, thereby removing all the related leakage vector.Our implementation relies on HACL*, a formally verified crypto library guaranteeing secret-independence.We design Dragonstar, so that its integration within hostap requires minimal modifications to the existing project.Our experiments show that the performance of HACL*-based hostap is comparable to OpenSSL-based, implying that Dragonstar is both efficient and proved to be leakage-free.</p>

                  <p>Due to the immutable and decentralized nature of Ethereum (ETH) platform, smart contracts are prone to security risks that can result in financial loss.While existing machine learning-based vulnerability detection algorithms achieve high accuracy at the contract level, they require developers to manually inspect source code to locate bugs.To this end, we present G-Scan, the first end-to-end fine-grained line-level vulnerability detection system evaluated on the first-of-its-kind real world dataset.G-Scan first converts smart contracts to code graphs in a dependency and hierarchy preserving manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we train a graph neural network to identify vulnerable nodes and assess security risks.</span>Finally, the code graphs with node vulnerability predictions are mapped back to the smart contracts for line-level localization.We train and evaluate G-Scan on a collected real world smart contracts dataset with line-level annotations on reentrancy vulnerability, one of the most common and severe types of smart contract vulnerabilities.With the well-designed graph representation and high-quality dataset, G-Scan achieves 93.02% F1-score in contract-level vulnerability detection and 93.69% F1-score in line-level vulnerability localization.Additionally, the lightweight graph neural network enables G-Scan to localize vulnerabilities in 6.1k lines of code smart contract within 1.2 seconds.</p>

The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that Tor not only allows resource sharing but, according to recent reports, even promotes it.</p>
