                  <p>Sketch-based terrain generation seeks to create realistic landscapes for virtual environments in various applications such as computer games, animation and virtual reality.Recently, deep learning based terrain generation has emerged, notably the ones based on generative adversarial networks (GAN).However, these methods often struggle to fulfill the requirements of flexible user control and maintain generative diversity for realistic terrain.Therefore, we propose a novel diffusion-based method, namely terrain diffusion network (TDN), which actively incorporates user guidance for enhanced controllability, taking into account terrain features like rivers, ridges, basins, and peaks.Instead of adhering to a conventional monolithic denoising process, which often compromises the fidelity of terrain details or the alignment with user control, a multi-level denoising scheme is proposed to generate more realistic terrains by taking into account fine-grained details, particularly those related to climatic patterns influenced by erosion and tectonic activities.Specifically, three terrain synthesisers are designed for structural, intermediate, and fine-grained level denoising purposes, which allow each synthesiser concentrate on a distinct terrain aspect.Moreover, to maximise the efficiency of our TDN, we further introduce terrain and sketch latent spaces for the synthesizers with pre-trained terrain autoencoders.Comprehensive experiments on a new dataset constructed from NASA Topology Images clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset will be publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.925</span></span></p>

                  <p>Binary silhouettes and keypoint-based skeletons have dominated human gait recognition studies for decades since they are easy to extract from video frames.Despite their success in gait recognition for in-the-lab environments, they usually fail in real-world scenarios due to their low information entropy for gait representations.To achieve accurate gait recognition in the wild, this paper presents a novel gait representation, named Gait Parsing Sequence (GPS).GPSs are sequences of fine-grained human segmentation, i.e., human parsing, extracted from video frames, so they have much higher information entropy to encode the shapes and dynamics of fine-grained human parts during walking.Moreover, to effectively explore the capability of the GPS representation, we propose a novel human parsing-based gait recognition framework, named ParsingGait.ParsingGait contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based backbone and two light-weighted heads.The first head extracts global semantic features from GPSs, while the other one learns mutual information of part-level features through Graph Convolutional Networks to model the detailed dynamics of human walking.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, due to the lack of suitable datasets, we build the first parsing-based dataset for gait recognition in the wild, named Gait3D-Parsing, by extending the large-scale and challenging Gait3D dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>Based on Gait3D-Parsing, we comprehensively evaluate our method and existing gait recognition methods.The experimental results show a significant improvement in accuracy brought by the GPS representation and the superiority of ParsingGait.The code and dataset are available at https://gait3d.github.io/gait3d-parsing-hp .</p>

                  <p>Amodal object segmentation is a challenging task that involves segmenting both visible and occluded parts of an object.In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Coarse-to-Fine Segmentation (C2F-Seg), that addresses this problem by progressively modeling the amodal segmentation.C2F-Seg initially reduces the learning space from the pixel-level image space to the vector-quantized latent space.This enables us to better handle long-range dependencies and learn a coarse-grained amodal segment from visual features and visible segments.However, this latent space lacks detailed information about the object, which makes it difficult to provide a precise segmentation directly.To address this issue, we propose a convolution refine module to inject fine-grained information and provide a more precise amodal object segmentation based on visual features and coarse-predicted segmentation.To help the studies of amodal object segmentation, we create a synthetic amodal dataset, named as MOViD-Amodal (MOViD-A), which can be used for both image and video amodal object segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We extensively evaluate our model on two benchmark datasets: KINS and COCO-A.

                  <p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently witnessed rapid advancements, exhibiting a remarkable capacity for perceiving, understanding, and processing visual information by connecting visual receptor with large language models (LLMs).However, current assessments mainly focus on recognizing and reasoning abilities, lacking direct evaluation of conversational skills and neglecting visual storytelling abilities.In this paper, we propose an evaluation method that uses strong LLMs as judges to comprehensively evaluate the various abilities of LVLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, we construct a comprehensive visual dialogue dataset TouchStone, consisting of open-world images and questions, covering five major categories of abilities and 27 subtasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset not only covers fundamental recognition and comprehension but also extends to literary creation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>Secondly, by integrating detailed image annotations we effectively transform the multimodal input content into a form understandable by LLMs.This enables us to employ advanced LLMs for directly evaluating the quality of the multimodal dialogue without requiring human intervention.Through validation, we demonstrate that powerful LVLMs, such as GPT-4, can effectively score dialogue quality by leveraging their textual capabilities alone, aligning with human preferences.We hope our work can serve as a touchstone for LVLMs' evaluation and pave the way for building stronger LVLMs.The evaluation code is available at https://github.com/OFA-Sys/TouchStone.</p>

                  <p>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for securing face recognition systems.However, existing FAS methods with handcrafted binary or pixel-wise labels have limitations due to diverse presentation attacks (PAs).In this paper, we propose an attack type robust face anti-spoofing framework under light flash, called ATR-FAS.Due to imaging differences caused by various attack types, traditional FAS methods based on single binary classification network may result in excessive intra-class distance of spoof faces, leading to a challenge of decision boundary learning.Therefore, we employed multiple networks to reconstruct multi-frame depth maps as auxiliary supervision, and each network experts in one type of attack.A dual gate module (DGM) consisting of a type gate and a frame-attention gate is introduced, which perform attack type recognition and multi-frame attention generation, respectively.The outputs of DGM are utilized as weight to mix the result of multiple expert networks.The multi-experts mixture enables ATR-FAS to generate spoof-differentiated depth maps, and stably detects spoof faces without being affected by different types of PAs.Moreover, we design a differential normalization procedure to convert original flash frames into differential frames.This simple but effective processing enhances the details in flash frames, aiding in the generation of depth maps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To verify the effectiveness of our framework, we collected a large-scale dataset containing 12,660 live and spoof videos with diverse PAs under dynamic flash from the smartphone screen. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span>Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ATR-FAS significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/Chaochao-Lin/ATR-FAS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span></p>

                  <p>The robustness of object detection models is a major concern when applied to real-world scenarios.However, the performance of most object detection models degrades when applied to images subjected to corruptions, since they are usually trained and evaluated on clean datasets.Enhancing the robustness of object detection models is of utmost importance, especially for those designed for aerial images, which feature complex backgrounds, substantial variations in scales and orientations of objects.This paper addresses the challenge of assessing the robustness of object detection models in aerial images, with a specific emphasis on scenarios where images are affected by clouds.In this study, we introduce two novel benchmarks based on DOTA-v1.0.The first benchmark encompasses 19 prevalent corruptions, while the second focuses on cloud-corrupted images-a phenomenon uncommon in natural pictures yet frequent in aerial photography.We systematically evaluate the robustness of mainstream object detection models and perform numerous ablation experiments.Through our investigations, we find that enhanced model architectures, larger networks, well-crafted modules, and judicious data augmentation strategies collectively enhance the robustness of aerial object detection models.The benchmarks we propose and our comprehensive experimental analyses can facilitate research on robust object detection in aerial images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Codes and datasets are available at: (https://github.com/hehaodong530/DOTA-C) <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p>The emergence of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) emphasizes the need for accurate and efficient prompting approaches.LLMs are often applied in Few-Shot Learning (FSL) contexts, where tasks are executed with minimal training data.FSL has become popular in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) subdomains, including AI for health.Rare diseases, affecting a small fraction of the population, inherently require FSL techniques due to limited data availability, though manual data collection and annotation is costly and time-consuming.In this paper, we propose Models-Vote Prompting (MVP), a flexible prompting approach for improving the performance of LLM queries in FSL settings.MVP works by prompting numerous LLMs to perform the same tasks and then conducting a majority vote on the resulting outputs.This method achieves improved results to any one model in the ensemble on one-shot rare disease identification and classification tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also release a novel rare disease dataset for FSL, available to those who agreed to the MIMIC-IV Data Use Agreement (DUA). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Furthermore, in using MVP, each model is prompted multiple times, substantially increasing the time needed for manual annotation, and to address this, we assess the feasibility of using JSON for automating generative LLM evaluation.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Issue-commit links, as a type of software traceability links, play a vital role in various software development and maintenance tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>However, they are typically deficient, as developers often forget or fail to create tags when making commits.Existing studies have deployed deep learning techniques, including pretrained models, to improve automatic issue-commit link recovery.Despite their promising performance, we argue that previous approaches have four main problems, hindering them from recovering links in large software projects.To overcome these problems, we propose an efficient and accurate pre-trained framework called EALink for issue-commit link recovery.EALink requires much fewer model parameters than existing pre-trained methods, bringing efficient training and recovery.Moreover, we design various techniques to improve the recovery accuracy of EALink.We construct a large-scale dataset and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the power of EALink.Results show that EALink outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (15.23%-408.65%) on various evaluation metrics.Meanwhile, its training and inference overhead is orders of magnitude lower than existing methods.</p>
