                  <p>Reconstructing an avatar from a portrait image has many applications in multimedia, but remains a challenging research problem.Extracting reflectance maps and geometry from one image is ill-posed: recovering geometry is a one-to-many mapping problem and reflectance and light are difficult to disentangle.Accurate geometry and reflectance can be captured under the controlled conditions of a light stage, but it is costly to acquire large datasets in this fashion.Moreover, training solely with this type of data leads to poor generalization with in-the-wild images.This motivates the introduction of MoSAR, a method for 3D avatar generation from monocular images.We propose a semi-supervised training scheme that improves generalization by learning from both light stage and in-the-wild datasets.This is achieved using a novel differentiable shading formulation.We show that our approach effectively disentangles the intrinsic face parameters, producing relightable avatars.As a result, MoSAR estimates a richer set of skin reflectance maps, and generates more realistic avatars than existing state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also introduce a new dataset, named FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics, the first public dataset providing intrisic face attributes at scale (diffuse, specular, ambient occlusion and translucency maps) for a total of 10k subjects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.916</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The project website and the dataset are available on the following link: https://ubisoftlaforge.github.io/character/mosar <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.814</span></span></p>

                  <p>Public dataset limitations have significantly hindered the development and benchmarking of learning to defer (L2D) algorithms, which aim to optimally combine human and AI capabilities in hybrid decision-making systems.In such systems, human availability and domain-specific concerns introduce difficulties, while obtaining human predictions for training and evaluation is costly.Financial fraud detection is a high-stakes setting where algorithms and human experts often work in tandem; however, there are no publicly available datasets for L2D concerning this important application of human-AI teaming.To fill this gap in L2D research, we introduce the Financial Fraud Alert Review Dataset (FiFAR), a synthetic bank account fraud detection dataset, containing the predictions of a team of 50 highly complex and varied synthetic fraud analysts, with varied bias and feature dependence.We also provide a realistic definition of human work capacity constraints, an aspect of L2D systems that is often overlooked, allowing for extensive testing of assignment systems under real-world conditions.We use our dataset to develop a capacity-aware L2D method and rejection learning approach under realistic data availability conditions, and benchmark these baselines under an array of 300 distinct testing scenarios.We believe that this dataset will serve as a pivotal instrument in facilitating a systematic, rigorous, reproducible, and transparent evaluation and comparison of L2D methods, thereby fostering the development of more synergistic human-AI collaboration in decision-making systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The public dataset and detailed synthetic expert information are available at: https://github.com/feedzai/fifar-dataset <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models have shown impressive results for multi-hop mathematical reasoning when the input question is only textual.Many mathematical reasoning problems, however, contain both text and image.With the ever-increasing adoption of vision language models (VLMs), understanding their reasoning abilities for such problems is crucial.In this paper, we evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs along various axes through the lens of geometry problems.We procedurally create a synthetic dataset of geometry questions with controllable difficulty levels along multiple axes, thus enabling a systematic evaluation.The empirical results obtained using our benchmark for state-of-the-art VLMs indicate that these models are not as capable in subjects like geometry (and, by generalization, other topics requiring similar reasoning) as suggested by previous benchmarks.This is made especially clear by the construction of our benchmark at various depth levels, since solving higher-depth problems requires long chains of reasoning rather than additional memorized knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the dataset for further research in this area. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.928</span></span></p>

                  <p>Instance shape reconstruction from a 3D scene involves recovering the full geometries of multiple objects at the semantic instance level.Many methods leverage data-driven learning due to the intricacies of scene complexity and significant indoor occlusions.Training these methods often requires a large-scale, high-quality dataset with aligned and paired shape annotations with real-world scans.Existing datasets are either synthetic or misaligned, restricting the performance of data-driven methods on real data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce LASA, a Large-scale Aligned Shape Annotation Dataset comprising 10,412 high-quality CAD annotations aligned with 920 real-world scene scans from ArkitScenes, created manually by professional artists. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span>On this top, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Cross-Modal Shape Reconstruction (DisCo) method.It is empowered by a hybrid feature aggregation design to fuse multi-modal inputs and recover high-fidelity object geometries.Besides, we present an Occupancy-Guided 3D Object Detection (OccGOD) method and demonstrate that our shape annotations provide scene occupancy clues that can further improve 3D object detection.Supported by LASA, extensive experiments show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance in both instance-level scene reconstruction and 3D object detection tasks.</p>

                  <p>Online learning is a rapidly growing industry due to its convenience.However, a major challenge in online learning is whether students are as engaged as they are in face-to-face classes.An engagement recognition system can significantly improve the learning experience in online classes.Current challenges in engagement detection involve poor label quality in the dataset, intra-class variation, and extreme data imbalance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these problems, we present the CMOSE dataset, which contains a large number of data in different engagement levels and high-quality labels generated according to the psychological advice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>We demonstrate the advantage of transferability by analyzing the model performance on other engagement datasets.We also developed a training mechanism, MocoRank, to handle the intra-class variation, the ordinal relationship between different classes, and the data imbalance problem.MocoRank outperforms prior engagement detection losses, achieving a 1.32% enhancement in overall accuracy and 5.05% improvement in average accuracy.We further demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-modality by conducting ablation studies on features such as pre-trained video features, high-level facial features, and audio features.</p>

                  <p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) for RGB images has achieved significant success, yet there is still limited research on SSL for infrared images, primarily due to three prominent challenges: 1) the lack of a suitable large-scale infrared pre-training dataset, 2) the distinctiveness of non-iconic infrared images rendering common pre-training tasks like masked image modeling (MIM) less effective, and 3) the scarcity of fine-grained textures making it particularly challenging to learn general image features.To address these issues, we construct a Multi-Scene Infrared Pre-training (MSIP) dataset comprising 178,756 images, and introduce object-sensitive random RoI cropping, an image preprocessing method, to tackle the challenge posed by non-iconic images.To alleviate the impact of weak textures on feature learning, we propose a pre-training paradigm called Pre-training with ADapter (PAD), which uses adapters to learn domain-specific features while freezing parameters pre-trained on ImageNet to retain the general feature extraction capability.This new paradigm is applicable to any transformer-based SSL method.Furthermore, to achieve more flexible coordination between pre-trained and newly-learned features in different layers and patches, a patchwise-scale adapter with dynamically learnable scale factors is introduced.Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks show that PAD, with only 1.23M pre-trainable parameters, outperforms other baseline paradigms including continual full pre-training on MSIP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/casiatao/PAD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite significant recent progress in the field of autonomous driving, modern methods still struggle and can incur serious accidents when encountering long-tail unforeseen events and challenging urban scenarios.On the one hand, large language models (LLM) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities that approach "Artificial General Intelligence".On the other hand, previous autonomous driving methods tend to rely on limited-format inputs (e.g. sensor data and navigation waypoints), restricting the vehicle's ability to understand language information and interact with humans.To this end, this paper introduces LMDrive, a novel language-guided, end-to-end, closed-loop autonomous driving framework.LMDrive uniquely processes and integrates multi-modal sensor data with natural language instructions, enabling interaction with humans and navigation software in realistic instructional settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate further research in language-based closed-loop autonomous driving, we also publicly release the corresponding dataset which includes approximately 64K instruction-following data clips, and the LangAuto benchmark that tests the system's ability to handle complex instructions and challenging driving scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.872</span></span>Extensive closed-loop experiments are conducted to demonstrate LMDrive's effectiveness.To the best of our knowledge, we're the very first work to leverage LLMs for closed-loop end-to-end autonomous driving.Codes can be found at https://github.com/opendilab/LMDrive</p>

                  <p>While there are numerous benchmarks comparing the performance of modern language models (LMs), end-task evaluations often conflate notions of *factual accuracy* ("truth") and *reasoning ability* ("rationality", or "honesty" in the sense of correctly reporting implications of beliefs).Our goal is a dataset that clearly distinguishes these two notions.Our approach is to leverage and extend a collection of human-annotated *entailment trees*, engineered to express both good and bad chains of reasoning, and using a mixture of true and false facts, in particular including counterfactual examples, to avoid belief bias (also known as the "content effect").<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The resulting dataset, called BaRDa, contains 3000 entailments (1787 valid, 1213 invalid), using 6681 true and 2319 false statements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span>Testing on four GPT-series models, GPT3(curie)/GPT3(davinici)/3.5/4, we find factual accuracy (truth) scores of 74.1/80.6/82.6/87.1 and reasoning accuracy scores of 63.1/78.0/71.8/79.2.This shows the clear progression of models towards improved factual accuracy and entailment reasoning, and the dataset provides a new benchmark that more cleanly separates and quantifies these two notions.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in diffusion-based models have demonstrated significant success in generating images from text.However, video editing models have not yet reached the same level of visual quality and user control.To address this, we introduce RAVE, a zero-shot video editing method that leverages pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models without additional training.RAVE takes an input video and a text prompt to produce high-quality videos while preserving the original motion and semantic structure.It employs a novel noise shuffling strategy, leveraging spatio-temporal interactions between frames, to produce temporally consistent videos faster than existing methods.It is also efficient in terms of memory requirements, allowing it to handle longer videos.RAVE is capable of a wide range of edits, from local attribute modifications to shape transformations.In order to demonstrate the versatility of RAVE, we create a comprehensive video evaluation dataset ranging from object-focused scenes to complex human activities like dancing and typing, and dynamic scenes featuring swimming fish and boats.Our qualitative and quantitative experiments highlight the effectiveness of RAVE in diverse video editing scenarios compared to existing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, dataset and videos can be found in https://rave-video.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.853</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools for open-ended image understanding tasks, including open vocabulary segmentation.Yet, direct application of such VLMs to segmentation is non-trivial, since VLMs are trained with image-text pairs and naturally lack pixel-level granularity.Recent works have made advancements in bridging this gap, often by leveraging the shared image-text space in which the image and a provided text prompt are represented.In this paper, we challenge the capabilities of VLMs further and tackle open-vocabulary segmentation without the need for any textual input.To this end, we propose a novel Self-Guided Semantic Segmentation (Self-Seg) framework.Self-Seg is capable of automatically detecting relevant class names from clustered BLIP embeddings and using these for accurate semantic segmentation.In addition, we propose an LLM-based Open-Vocabulary Evaluator (LOVE) to effectively assess predicted open-vocabulary class names.We achieve state-of-the-art results on Pascal VOC, ADE20K and CityScapes for open-vocabulary segmentation without given class names, as well as competitive performance with methods where class names are given.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and data will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the commercial abundance of UAVs, aerial data acquisition remains challenging, and the existing Asia and North America-centric open-source UAV datasets are small-scale or low-resolution and lack diversity in scene contextuality.Additionally, the color content of the scenes, solar-zenith angle, and population density of different geographies influence the data diversity.These two factors conjointly render suboptimal aerial-visual perception of the deep neural network (DNN) models trained primarily on the ground-view data, including the open-world foundational models.   To pave the way for a transformative era of aerial detection, we present Multiview Aerial Visual RECognition or MAVREC, a video dataset where we record synchronized scenes from different perspectives -- ground camera and drone-mounted camera.MAVREC consists of around 2.5 hours of industry-standard 2.7K resolution video sequences, more than 0.5 million frames, and 1.1 million annotated bounding boxes.This makes MAVREC the largest ground and aerial-view dataset, and the fourth largest among all drone-based datasets across all modalities and tasks.Through our extensive benchmarking on MAVREC, we recognize that augmenting object detectors with ground-view images from the corresponding geographical location is a superior pre-training strategy for aerial detection.Building on this strategy, we benchmark MAVREC with a curriculum-based semi-supervised object detection approach that leverages labeled (ground and aerial) and unlabeled (only aerial) images to enhance the aerial detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We publicly release the MAVREC dataset: https://mavrec.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

We show that using gradient boosting decision trees at the Knowledge Neuron layer, i.e., at the hidden layer of the feed-forward network of the transformer as a probing classifier for recognizing parts of a sentence is more advantageous than using logistic regression on the output representations of the transformer layer.This approach is also preferable to many other methods.The gain in error rate, depending on the preset, ranges from 9-54%</p>

                  <p>In modern machine learning, the trend of harnessing self-supervised learning to derive high-quality representations without label dependency has garnered significant attention.However, the absence of label information, coupled with the inherently high-dimensional nature, improves the difficulty for the interpretation of learned representations.Consequently, indirect evaluations become the popular metric for evaluating the quality of these features, leading to a biased validation of the learned representation rationale.To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Concept-based Explainable Image Representation (CEIR).Initially, using the Concept-based Model (CBM) incorporated with pretrained CLIP and concepts generated by GPT-4, we project input images into a concept vector space.Subsequently, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) learns the latent representation from these projected concepts, which serves as the final image representation.Due to the capability of the representation to encapsulate high-level, semantically relevant concepts, the model allows for attributions to a human-comprehensible concept space.This not only enhances interpretability but also preserves the robustness essential for downstream tasks.For instance, our method exhibits state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering performance on benchmarks such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10.Furthermore, capitalizing on the universality of human conceptual understanding, CEIR can seamlessly extract the related concept from open-world images without fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This offers a fresh approach to automatic label generation and label manipulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD) based on deep learning has proven to be an effective and flexible solution, attracting extensive research.Deep neural networks can learn rich representations from vast amounts of representative labeled data for various applications.In IFD, they achieve high classification performance from signals in an end-to-end manner, without requiring extensive domain knowledge.However, deep learning models usually only perform well on the data distribution they have been trained on.When applied to a different distribution, they may experience performance drops.This is also observed in IFD, where assets are often operated in working conditions different from those in which labeled data have been collected.Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) deals with the scenario where labeled data are available in a source domain, and only unlabeled data are available in a target domain, where domains may correspond to operating conditions.Recent methods rely on training with confident pseudo-labels for target samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the confidence-based selection of pseudo-labels is hindered by poorly calibrated confidence estimates in the target domain, primarily due to over-confident predictions, which limits the quality of pseudo-labels and leads to error accumulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>In this paper, we propose a novel UDA method called Calibrated Adaptive Teacher (CAT), where we propose to calibrate the predictions of the teacher network throughout the self-training process, leveraging post-hoc calibration techniques.We evaluate CAT on domain-adaptive IFD and perform extensive experiments on the Paderborn benchmark for bearing fault diagnosis under varying operating conditions.Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most transfer tasks.</p>

                  <p>Software debloating tools seek to improve the program security and performance by removing unnecessary code, called bloat.While many techniques have been proposed, several barriers to their adoption have emerged.Namely, debloating tools are highly specialized, making it difficult for adopters to find the right type of tool for their needs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is further hindered by a lack of established metrics and comparative evaluations between tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>To close this gap, we surveyed of 10 years of debloating literature and several tools currently under commercial development to systematize the debloating ecosystem's knowledge.We then conducted a broad comparative evaluation of 10 debloating tools to determine their relative strengths and weaknesses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation, conducted on a diverse set of 20 benchmark programs, measures tools across 16 performance, security, correctness, and usability metrics.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Our evaluation surfaces several concerning findings that contradict the prevailing narrative in debloating literature.First, debloating tools lack the required maturity to be used on real-world software, evidenced by a slim 21% overall success rate for creating passable debloated versions of medium- and high-complexity benchmarks.Second, debloating tools struggle to produce sound and robust programs.Using our novel differential fuzzing tool, DIFFER, we discovered that only 13% of our debloating attempts produced a sound and robust debloated program.Finally, our results indicate that debloating tools typically do not improve the performance or security posture of debloated programs by a significant degree.We believe that our contributions in this paper will help potential adopters better understand the landscape of tools and will motivate future research and development of more capable debloating tools.To this end, we have made our benchmark set, data, and custom tools publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Sequential recommendation aims to infer user preferences from historical interaction sequences and predict the next item that users may be interested in the future.The current mainstream design approach is to represent items as fixed vectors, capturing the underlying relationships between items and user preferences based on the order of interactions.However, relying on a single fixed-item embedding may weaken the modeling capability of the system, and the global dynamics and local saliency exhibited by user preferences need to be distinguished.To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel diffusion recommendation algorithm based on multi-scale cnn and residual lstm (AREAL).We introduce diffusion models into the recommend system, representing items as probability distributions instead of fixed vectors.This approach enables adaptive reflection of multiple aspects of the items and generates item distributions in a denoising manner.We use multi-scale cnn and residual lstm methods to extract the local and global dependency features of user history interactions, and use attention mechanism to distinguish weights as the guide features of reverse diffusion recovery.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments conducted on two real-world datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, AREAL obtains improvements over the best baselines by 2.63% and 4.25% in terms of HR@20 and 5.05% and 3.94% in terms of NDCG@20 on all datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>The substantial success of Vision Transformer (ViT) in computer vision tasks is largely attributed to the architecture design.This underscores the necessity of efficient architecture search for designing better ViTs automatically.As training-based architecture search methods are computationally intensive, there is a growing interest in training-free methods that use zero-cost proxies to score ViTs.However, existing training-free approaches require expert knowledge to manually design specific zero-cost proxies.Moreover, these zero-cost proxies exhibit limitations to generalize across diverse domains.In this paper, we introduce Auto-Prox, an automatic proxy discovery framework, to address the problem.First, we build the ViT-Bench-101, which involves different ViT candidates and their actual performance on multiple datasets.Utilizing ViT-Bench-101, we can evaluate zero-cost proxies based on their score-accuracy correlation.Then, we represent zero-cost proxies with computation graphs and organize the zero-cost proxy search space with ViT statistics and primitive operations.To discover generic zero-cost proxies, we propose a joint correlation metric to evolve and mutate different zero-cost proxy candidates.We introduce an elitism-preserve strategy for search efficiency to achieve a better trade-off between exploitation and exploration.Based on the discovered zero-cost proxy, we conduct a ViT architecture search in a training-free manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generalizes well to different datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results both in ranking correlation and final accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>Codes can be found at https://github.com/lilujunai/Auto-Prox-AAAI24.</p>

We then propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm whose outputs are provably no worse than those of the trivial algorithm, but often substantially better.A family of problem instances is presented for which our improved algorithm produces optimal solutions, while, for any $\varepsilon$, the trivial algorithm can\emph{not}\/ attain a $(2-\varepsilon)$-approximation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results may lead to the first polynomial-time approximation algorithm that solves the CP-net aggregation problem for swaps with an approximation ratio substantially better than $2$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep learning models are known to suffer from the problem of bias, and researchers have been exploring methods to address this issue.However, most of these methods require prior knowledge of the bias and are not always practical.In this paper, we focus on a more practical setting with no prior information about the bias.Generally, in this setting, there are a large number of bias-aligned samples that cause the model to produce biased predictions and a few bias-conflicting samples that do not conform to the bias.If the training data is limited, the influence of the bias-aligned samples may become even stronger on the model predictions, and we experimentally demonstrate that existing debiasing techniques suffer severely in such cases.In this paper, we examine the effects of unknown bias in small dataset regimes and present a novel approach to mitigate this issue.The proposed approach directly addresses the issue of the extremely low occurrence of bias-conflicting samples in limited data settings through the synthesis of hybrid samples that can be used to reduce the effect of bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in addressing any unknown bias in the presence of limited data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, our approach outperforms the vanilla, LfF, LDD, and DebiAN debiasing methods by absolute margins of 10.39%, 9.08%, 8.07%, and 9.67% when only 10% of the Corrupted CIFAR-10 Type 1 dataset is available with a bias-conflicting sample ratio of 0.05. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human Pose and Shape Estimation (HPSE) from RGB images can be broadly categorized into two main groups: parametric and non-parametric approaches.Parametric techniques leverage a low-dimensional statistical body model for realistic results, whereas recent non-parametric methods achieve higher precision by directly regressing the 3D coordinates of the human body.Despite their strengths, both approaches face limitations: the parameters of statistical body models pose challenges as regression targets, and predicting 3D coordinates introduces computational complexities and issues related to smoothness.In this work, we take a novel approach to address the HPSE problem.We introduce a unique method involving a low-dimensional discrete latent representation of the human mesh, framing HPSE as a classification task.Instead of predicting body model parameters or 3D vertex coordinates, our focus is on forecasting the proposed discrete latent representation, which can be decoded into a registered human mesh.This innovative paradigm offers two key advantages: firstly, predicting a low-dimensional discrete representation confines our predictions to the space of anthropomorphic poses and shapes; secondly, by framing the problem as a classification task, we can harness the discriminative power inherent in neural networks.Our proposed model, VQ-HPS, a transformer-based architecture, forecasts the discrete latent representation of the mesh, trained through minimizing a cross-entropy loss.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that VQ-HPS outperforms the current state-of-the-art non-parametric approaches while yielding results as realistic as those produced by parametric methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>This highlights the significant potential of the classification approach for HPSE.</p>

                  <p>In practice, preference learning from human feedback depends on incomplete data with hidden context.Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model.This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria.We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called Borda count.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function.A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF.As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference learning (DPL).DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context.Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/hidden-context</p>

                  <p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in online recommendation platforms as it involves estimating the probability of user engagement with advertisements or items by clicking on them.Given the availability of various services like online shopping, ride-sharing, food delivery, and professional services on commercial platforms, recommendation systems in these platforms are required to make CTR predictions across multiple domains rather than just a single domain.However, multi-domain click-through rate (MDCTR) prediction remains a challenging task in online recommendation due to the complex mutual influence between domains.Traditional MDCTR models typically encode domains as discrete identifiers, ignoring rich semantic information underlying.Consequently, they can hardly generalize to new domains.Besides, existing models can be easily dominated by some specific domains, which results in significant performance drops in the other domains (\ie the ``seesaw phenomenon``).In this paper, we propose a novel solution Uni-CTR to address the above challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Uni-CTR leverages a backbone Large Language Model (LLM) to learn layer-wise semantic representations that capture commonalities between domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Uni-CTR also uses several domain-specific networks to capture the characteristics of each domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Note that we design a masked loss strategy so that these domain-specific networks are decoupled from backbone LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>This allows domain-specific networks to remain unchanged when incorporating new or removing domains, thereby enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the system significantly.Experimental results on three public datasets show that Uni-CTR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MDCTR models significantly.Furthermore, Uni-CTR demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in zero-shot prediction.We have applied Uni-CTR in industrial scenarios, confirming its efficiency.</p>

In this work, we propose JailGuard, the first mutation-based jailbreaking detection framework which supports both image and text modalities.Our key observation is that attack queries inherently possess less robustness compared to benign queries.Specifically, to confuse the model, attack queries are usually crafted with well-designed templates or complicate perturbations, leading to a fact that a slight disturbance in input may result in a drastic change in the response.This lack of robustness can be utilized in attack detection.Based on this intuition, we designed and implemented a detection framework comprising 19 different mutators and a divergence-based detection formula.To fully understand the effectiveness of our framework, we built the first multi-modal LLM jailbreaking attack dataset, which has 304 items of data, covering ten types of known jailbreaking attacks on image and text modalities.The evaluation suggests that JailGuard achieves the best detection accuracy of 89.38%/85.42% on image and text inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art defense methods by 15.28%.</p>

Our work studies how high-quality datasets may be the key for small language models to acquire mathematical reasoning.We introduce \texttt{TinyGSM}, a synthetic dataset of 12.3M grade school math problems paired with Python solutions, generated fully by GPT-3.5.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>After finetuning on \texttt{TinyGSM}, we find that a duo of a 1.3B generation model and a 1.3B verifier model can achieve 81.5\% accuracy, outperforming existing models that are orders of magnitude larger. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>This also rivals the performance of the GPT-3.5 ``teacher'' model (77.4\%), from which our model's training data is generated.Our approach is simple and has two key components: 1) the high-quality dataset \texttt{TinyGSM}, 2) the use of a verifier, which selects the final outputs from multiple candidate generations.</p>
