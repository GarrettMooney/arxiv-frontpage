                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in understanding and responding to user intents.However, their performance lag behind general use cases in some expertise domains, such as Chinese medicine.Existing efforts to incorporate Chinese medicine into LLMs rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with single-turn and distilled dialogue data.These models lack the ability for doctor-like proactive inquiry and multi-turn comprehension and cannot always align responses with safety and professionalism experts.In this work, we introduce Zhongjing, the first Chinese medical LLaMA-based LLM that implements an entire training pipeline from pre-training to reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we introduce a Chinese multi-turn medical dialogue dataset of 70,000 authentic doctor-patient dialogues, CMtMedQA, which significantly enhances the model's capability for complex dialogue and proactive inquiry initiation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>We define a refined annotation rule and evaluation criteria given the biomedical domain's unique characteristics.Results show that our model outperforms baselines in various capacities and matches the performance of ChatGPT in a few abilities, despite having 50x training data with previous best model and 100x parameters with ChatGPT.RLHF further improves the model's instruction-following ability and safety.We also release our code, datasets and model for further research.</p>

                  <p>A fundamental challenge in the current NLP context, dominated by language models, comes from the inflexibility of current architectures to 'learn' new information.While model-centric solutions like continual learning or parameter-efficient fine tuning are available, the question still remains of how to reliably identify changes in language or in the world.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose WikiTiDe, a dataset derived from pairs of timestamped definitions extracted from Wikipedia. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>We argue that such resource can be helpful for accelerating diachronic NLP, specifically, for training models able to scan knowledge resources for core updates concerning a concept, an event, or a named entity.Our proposed end-to-end method is fully automatic, and leverages a bootstrapping algorithm for gradually creating a high-quality dataset.Our results suggest that bootstrapping the seed version of WikiTiDe leads to better fine-tuned models.We also leverage fine-tuned models in a number of downstream tasks, showing promising results with respect to competitive baselines.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of natural language tasks.However, as these models continue to grow in size, they face significant challenges in terms of computational costs.Additionally, LLMs often lack efficient domain-specific understanding, which is particularly crucial in specialized fields such as aviation and healthcare.To boost the domain-specific understanding, we propose, KITLM, a novel knowledge base integration approach into language model through relevant information infusion.By integrating pertinent knowledge, not only the performance of the language model is greatly enhanced, but the model size requirement is also significantly reduced while achieving comparable performance.Our proposed knowledge-infused model surpasses the performance of both GPT-3.5-turbo and the state-of-the-art knowledge infusion method, SKILL, achieving over 1.5 times improvement in exact match scores on the MetaQA.KITLM showed a similar performance boost in the aviation domain with AeroQA.The drastic performance improvement of KITLM over the existing methods can be attributed to the infusion of relevant knowledge while mitigating noise.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we release two curated datasets to accelerate knowledge infusion research in specialized fields: a) AeroQA, a new benchmark dataset designed for multi-hop question-answering within the aviation domain, and b) Aviation Corpus, a dataset constructed from unstructured text extracted from the National Transportation Safety Board reports. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>Our research contributes to advancing the field of domain-specific language understanding and showcases the potential of knowledge infusion techniques in improving the performance of language models on question-answering.</p>

                  <p>Fusarium head blight is a devastating disease that causes significant economic losses annually on small grains.Efficiency, accuracy, and timely detection of FHB in the resistance screening are critical for wheat and barley breeding programs.In recent years, various image processing techniques have been developed using supervised machine learning algorithms for the early detection of FHB.The state-of-the-art convolutional neural network-based methods, such as U-Net, employ a series of encoding blocks to create a local representation and a series of decoding blocks to capture the semantic relations.However, these methods are not often capable of long-range modeling dependencies inside the input data, and their ability to model multi-scale objects with significant variations in texture and shape is limited.Vision transformers as alternative architectures with innate global self-attention mechanisms for sequence-to-sequence prediction, due to insufficient low-level details, may also limit localization capabilities.To overcome these limitations, a new Context Bridge is proposed to integrate the local representation capability of the U-Net network in the transformer model.In addition, the standard attention mechanism of the original transformer is replaced with Efficient Self-attention, which is less complicated than other state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To train the proposed network, 12,000 wheat images from an FHB-inoculated wheat field at the SDSU research farm in Volga, SD, were captured. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>In addition to healthy and unhealthy plants, these images encompass various stages of the disease.A team of expert pathologists annotated the images for training and evaluating the developed model.As a result, the effectiveness of the transformer-based method for FHB-disease detection, through extensive experiments across typical tasks for plant image segmentation, is demonstrated.</p>

                  <p>LiDAR-based fully sparse architecture has garnered increasing attention.FSDv1 stands out as a representative work, achieving impressive efficacy and efficiency, albeit with intricate structures and handcrafted designs.In this paper, we present FSDv2, an evolution that aims to simplify the previous FSDv1 while eliminating the inductive bias introduced by its handcrafted instance-level representation, thus promoting better general applicability.To this end, we introduce the concept of \textbf{virtual voxels}, which takes over the clustering-based instance segmentation in FSDv1.Virtual voxels not only address the notorious issue of the Center Feature Missing problem in fully sparse detectors but also endow the framework with a more elegant and streamlined approach.Consequently, we develop a suite of components to complement the virtual voxel concept, including a virtual voxel encoder, a virtual voxel mixer, and a virtual voxel assignment strategy.Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that the virtual voxel mechanism is functionally similar to the handcrafted clustering in FSDv1 while being more general.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct experiments on three large-scale datasets: Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2 dataset, and nuScenes dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.839</span></span>Our results showcase state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets, highlighting the superiority of FSDv2 in long-range scenarios and its general applicability to achieve competitive performance across diverse scenarios.Moreover, we provide comprehensive experimental analysis to elucidate the workings of FSDv2.To foster reproducibility and further research, we have open-sourced FSDv2 at https://github.com/tusen-ai/SST.</p>

                  <p>Next basket recommendation (NBR) is the task of predicting the next set of items based on a sequence of already purchased baskets.It is a recommendation task that has been widely studied, especially in the context of grocery shopping.In next basket recommendation (NBR), it is useful to distinguish between repeat items, i.e., items that a user has consumed before, and explore items, i.e., items that a user has not consumed before.Most NBR work either ignores this distinction or focuses on repeat items.We formulate the next novel basket recommendation (NNBR) task, i.e., the task of recommending a basket that only consists of novel items, which is valuable for both real-world application and NBR evaluation.We evaluate how existing NBR methods perform on the NNBR task and find that, so far, limited progress has been made w.r.t.the NNBR task.To address the NNBR task, we propose a simple bi-directional transformer basket recommendation model (BTBR), which is focused on directly modeling item-to-item correlations within and across baskets instead of learning complex basket representations.To properly train BTBR, we propose and investigate several masking strategies and training objectives: (i) item-level random masking, (ii) item-level select masking, (iii) basket-level all masking, (iv) basket-level explore masking, and (v) joint masking.In addition, an item-basket swapping strategy is proposed to enrich the item interactions within the same baskets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on three open datasets with various characteristics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>The results demonstrate the effectiveness of BTBR and our masking and swapping strategies for the NNBR task.BTBR with a properly selected masking and swapping strategy can substantially improve NNBR performance.</p>

                  <p>3D human pose estimation in outdoor environments has garnered increasing attention recently.However, prevalent 3D human pose datasets pertaining to outdoor scenes lack diversity, as they predominantly utilize only one type of modality (RGB image or pointcloud), and often feature only one individual within each scene.This limited scope of dataset infrastructure considerably hinders the variability of available data.In this article, we propose Human-M3, an outdoor multi-modal multi-view multi-person human pose database which includes not only multi-view RGB videos of outdoor scenes but also corresponding pointclouds.In order to obtain accurate human poses, we propose an algorithm based on multi-modal data input to generate ground truth annotation.This benefits from robust pointcloud detection and tracking, which solves the problem of inaccurate human localization and matching ambiguity that may exist in previous multi-view RGB videos in outdoor multi-person scenes, and generates reliable ground truth annotations.Evaluation of multiple different modalities algorithms has shown that this database is challenging and suitable for future research.Furthermore, we propose a 3D human pose estimation algorithm based on multi-modal data input, which demonstrates the advantages of multi-modal data input for 3D human pose estimation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data will be released on https://github.com/soullessrobot/Human-M3-Dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.902</span></span></p>

                  <p>Segmentation is a fundamental problem in surgical scene analysis using artificial intelligence.However, the inherent data scarcity in this domain makes it challenging to adapt traditional segmentation techniques for this task.To tackle this issue, current research employs pretrained models and finetunes them on the given data.Even so, these require training deep networks with millions of parameters every time new data becomes available.A recently published foundation model, Segment-Anything (SAM), generalizes well to a large variety of natural images, hence tackling this challenge to a reasonable extent.However, SAM does not generalize well to the medical domain as is without utilizing a large amount of compute resources for fine-tuning and using task-specific prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, these prompts are in the form of bounding-boxes or foreground/background points that need to be annotated explicitly for every image, making this solution increasingly tedious with higher data size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>In this work, we propose AdaptiveSAM - an adaptive modification of SAM that can adjust to new datasets quickly and efficiently, while enabling text-prompted segmentation.For finetuning AdaptiveSAM, we propose an approach called bias-tuning that requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than SAM (less than 2\%).At the same time, AdaptiveSAM requires negligible expert intervention since it uses free-form text as prompt and can segment the object of interest with just the label name as prompt.Our experiments show that AdaptiveSAM outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on various medical imaging datasets including surgery, ultrasound and X-ray.Code is available at https://github.com/JayParanjape/biastuning</p>

                  <p>Multi-label image recognition in the low-label regime is a task of great challenge and practical significance.Previous works have focused on learning the alignment between textual and visual spaces to compensate for limited image labels, yet may suffer from reduced accuracy due to the scarcity of high-quality multi-label annotations.In this research, we leverage the powerful alignment between textual and visual features pretrained with millions of auxiliary image-text pairs.We introduce an efficient and effective framework called Evidence-guided Dual Context Optimization (DualCoOp++), which serves as a unified approach for addressing partial-label and zero-shot multi-label recognition.In DualCoOp++ we separately encode evidential, positive, and negative contexts for target classes as parametric components of the linguistic input (i.e., prompts).The evidential context aims to discover all the related visual content for the target class, and serves as guidance to aggregate positive and negative contexts from the spatial domain of the image, enabling better distinguishment between similar categories.Additionally, we introduce a Winner-Take-All module that promotes inter-class interaction during training, while avoiding the need for extra parameters and costs.As DualCoOp++ imposes minimal additional learnable overhead on the pretrained vision-language framework, it enables rapid adaptation to multi-label recognition tasks with limited annotations and even unseen classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on standard multi-label recognition benchmarks across two challenging low-label settings demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a well-known method for exposing bugs/vulnerabilities in software systems.Popular fuzzers, such as AFL, use a biased random search over the domain of program inputs, where 100s or 1000s of inputs (test cases) are executed per second in order to expose bugs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If a bug is discovered, it can either be fixed manually by the developer or fixed automatically using an Automated Program Repair (APR) tool. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Like fuzzing, many existing APR tools are search-based, but over the domain of patches rather than inputs.   In this paper, we propose search-based program repair as patch-level fuzzing.The basic idea is to adapt a fuzzer (AFL) to fuzz over the patch space rather than the input space.Thus we use a patch-space fuzzer to explore a patch space, while using a traditional input level fuzzer to rule out patch candidates and help in patch selection.To improve the throughput, we propose a compilation-free patch validation methodology, where we execute the original (unpatched) program natively, then selectively interpret only the specific patched statements and expressions.Since this avoids (re)compilation, we show that compilation-free patch validation can achieve a similar throughput as input-level fuzzing (100s or 1000s of execs/sec).We show that patch-level fuzzing and input-level fuzzing can be combined, for a co-exploration of both spaces in order to find better quality patches.Such a collaboration between input-level fuzzing and patch-level fuzzing is then employed to search over candidate fix locations, as well as patch candidates in each fix location.</p>

                  <p>The aggregation of multiple opinions plays a crucial role in decision-making, such as in hiring and loan review, and in labeling data for supervised learning.Although majority voting and existing opinion aggregation models are effective for simple tasks, they are inappropriate for tasks without objectively true labels in which disagreements may occur.In particular, when voter attributes such as gender or race introduce bias into opinions, the aggregation results may vary depending on the composition of voter attributes.A balanced group of voters is desirable for fair aggregation results but may be difficult to prepare.In this study, we consider methods to achieve fair opinion aggregation based on voter attributes and evaluate the fairness of the aggregated results.To this end, we consider an approach that combines opinion aggregation models such as majority voting and the Dawid and Skene model (D&S model) with fairness options such as sample weighting.To evaluate the fairness of opinion aggregation, probabilistic soft labels are preferred over discrete class labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we address the problem of soft label estimation without considering voter attributes and identify some issues with the D&S model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>To address these limitations, we propose a new Soft D&S model with improved accuracy in estimating soft labels.Moreover, we evaluated the fairness of an opinion aggregation model, including Soft D&S, in combination with different fairness options using synthetic and semi-synthetic data.The experimental results suggest that the combination of Soft D&S and data splitting as a fairness option is effective for dense data, whereas weighted majority voting is effective for sparse data.These findings should prove particularly valuable in supporting decision-making by human and machine-learning models with balanced opinion aggregation.</p>

This paper presents the first study on the problem of assembly clone search with unseen architectures and libraries.We propose incorporating human common knowledge through large-scale pre-trained natural language models, in the form of transfer learning, into current learning-based approaches for assembly clone search.Transfer learning can aid in addressing the limitations of the existing approaches, as it can bring in broader knowledge from human experts in assembly code.We further address the sequence limit issue by proposing a reinforcement learning agent to remove unnecessary and redundant tokens.Coupled with a new Variational Information Bottleneck learning strategy, the proposed system minimizes the reliance on potential indicators of architectures and optimization settings, for a better generalization of unseen architectures.We simulate the unseen architecture clone search scenarios and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

                  <p>Images are loaded with semantic information that pertains to real-world ontologies: dog breeds share mammalian similarities, food pictures are often depicted in domestic environments, and so on.However, when training machine learning models for image classification, the relative similarities amongst object classes are commonly paired with one-hot-encoded labels.According to this logic, if an image is labelled as 'spoon', then 'tea-spoon' and 'shark' are equally wrong in terms of training loss.To overcome this limitation, we explore the integration of additional goals that reflect ontological and semantic knowledge, improving model interpretability and trustworthiness.We suggest a generic approach that allows to derive an additional loss term starting from any kind of semantic information about the classification label.First, we show how to apply our approach to ontologies and word embeddings, and discuss how the resulting information can drive a supervised learning process.Second, we use our semantically enriched loss to train image classifiers, and analyse the trade-offs between accuracy, mistake severity, and learned internal representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we discuss how this approach can be further exploited in terms of explainability and adversarial robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Code repository: https://github.com/S1M0N38/semantic-encodings</p>
