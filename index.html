                  <p>Tool tracking in surgical videos is vital in computer-assisted intervention for tasks like surgeon skill assessment, safety zone estimation, and human-machine collaboration during minimally invasive procedures.The lack of large-scale datasets hampers Artificial Intelligence implementation in this domain.Current datasets exhibit overly generic tracking formalization, often lacking surgical context: a deficiency that becomes evident when tools move out of the camera's scope, resulting in rigid trajectories that hinder realistic surgical representation.This paper addresses the need for a more precise and adaptable tracking formalization tailored to the intricacies of endoscopic procedures by introducing CholecTrack20, an extensive dataset meticulously annotated for multi-class multi-tool tracking across three perspectives representing the various ways of considering the temporal duration of a tool trajectory: (1) intraoperative, (2) intracorporeal, and (3) visibility within the camera's scope.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset comprises 20 laparoscopic videos with over 35,000 frames and 65,000 annotated tool instances with details on spatial location, category, identity, operator, phase, and surgical visual conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span>This detailed dataset caters to the evolving assistive requirements within a procedure.</p>

                  <p>Recently, the evaluation of Large Language Models has emerged as a popular area of research.The three crucial questions for LLM evaluation are ``what, where, and how to evaluate''.However, the existing research mainly focuses on the first two questions, which are basically what tasks to give the LLM during testing and what kind of knowledge it should deal with.As for the third question, which is about what standards to use, the types of evaluators, how to score, and how to rank, there hasn't been much discussion.In this paper, we analyze evaluation methods by comparing various criteria with both manual and automatic evaluation, utilizing onsite, crowd-sourcing, public annotators and GPT-4, with different scoring methods and ranking systems.We propose a new dataset, LLMEval and conduct evaluations on 20 LLMs.A total of 2,186 individuals participated, leading to the generation of 243,337 manual annotations and 57,511 automatic evaluation results.We perform comparisons and analyses of different settings and conduct 10 conclusions that can provide some insights for evaluating LLM in the future.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and the results are publicly available at https://github.com/llmeval . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite significant recent progress in the field of autonomous driving, modern methods still struggle and can incur serious accidents when encountering long-tail unforeseen events and challenging urban scenarios.On the one hand, large language models (LLM) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities that approach "Artificial General Intelligence".On the other hand, previous autonomous driving methods tend to rely on limited-format inputs (e.g. sensor data and navigation waypoints), restricting the vehicle's ability to understand language information and interact with humans.To this end, this paper introduces LMDrive, a novel language-guided, end-to-end, closed-loop autonomous driving framework.LMDrive uniquely processes and integrates multi-modal sensor data with natural language instructions, enabling interaction with humans and navigation software in realistic instructional settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate further research in language-based closed-loop autonomous driving, we also publicly release the corresponding dataset which includes approximately 64K instruction-following data clips, and the LangAuto benchmark that tests the system's ability to handle complex instructions and challenging driving scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.872</span></span>Extensive closed-loop experiments are conducted to demonstrate LMDrive's effectiveness.To the best of our knowledge, we're the very first work to leverage LLMs for closed-loop end-to-end autonomous driving.Codes can be found at https://github.com/opendilab/LMDrive</p>

                  <p>Despite the commercial abundance of UAVs, aerial data acquisition remains challenging, and the existing Asia and North America-centric open-source UAV datasets are small-scale or low-resolution and lack diversity in scene contextuality.Additionally, the color content of the scenes, solar-zenith angle, and population density of different geographies influence the data diversity.These two factors conjointly render suboptimal aerial-visual perception of the deep neural network (DNN) models trained primarily on the ground-view data, including the open-world foundational models.   To pave the way for a transformative era of aerial detection, we present Multiview Aerial Visual RECognition or MAVREC, a video dataset where we record synchronized scenes from different perspectives -- ground camera and drone-mounted camera.MAVREC consists of around 2.5 hours of industry-standard 2.7K resolution video sequences, more than 0.5 million frames, and 1.1 million annotated bounding boxes.This makes MAVREC the largest ground and aerial-view dataset, and the fourth largest among all drone-based datasets across all modalities and tasks.Through our extensive benchmarking on MAVREC, we recognize that augmenting object detectors with ground-view images from the corresponding geographical location is a superior pre-training strategy for aerial detection.Building on this strategy, we benchmark MAVREC with a curriculum-based semi-supervised object detection approach that leverages labeled (ground and aerial) and unlabeled (only aerial) images to enhance the aerial detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We publicly release the MAVREC dataset: https://mavrec.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Semantic part segmentation provides an intricate and interpretable understanding of an object, thereby benefiting numerous downstream tasks.However, the need for exhaustive annotations impedes its usage across diverse object types.This paper focuses on learning part segmentation from synthetic animals, leveraging the Skinned Multi-Animal Linear (SMAL) models to scale up existing synthetic data generated by computer-aided design (CAD) animal models.Compared to CAD models, SMAL models generate data with a wider range of poses observed in real-world scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, our first contribution is to construct a synthetic animal dataset of tigers and horses with more pose diversity, termed Synthetic Animal Parts (SAP). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>We then benchmark Syn-to-Real animal part segmentation from SAP to PartImageNet, namely SynRealPart, with existing semantic segmentation domain adaptation methods and further improve them as our second contribution.Concretely, we examine three Syn-to-Real adaptation methods but observe relative performance drop due to the innate difference between the two tasks.To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method called Class-Balanced Fourier Data Mixing (CB-FDM).Fourier Data Mixing aligns the spectral amplitudes of synthetic images with real images, thereby making the mixed images have more similar frequency content to real images.We further use Class-Balanced Pseudo-Label Re-Weighting to alleviate the imbalanced class distribution.We demonstrate the efficacy of CB-FDM on SynRealPart over previous methods with significant performance improvements.Remarkably, our third contribution is to reveal that the learned parts from synthetic tiger and horse are transferable across all quadrupeds in PartImageNet, further underscoring the utility and potential applications of animal part segmentation.</p>

                  <p>We address the problem of synthesizing multi-view optical illusions: images that change appearance upon a transformation, such as a flip or rotation.We propose a simple, zero-shot method for obtaining these illusions from off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion models.During the reverse diffusion process, we estimate the noise from different views of a noisy image.We then combine these noise estimates together and denoise the image.A theoretical analysis suggests that this method works precisely for views that can be written as orthogonal transformations, of which permutations are a subset.This leads to the idea of a visual anagram--an image that changes appearance under some rearrangement of pixels.This includes rotations and flips, but also more exotic pixel permutations such as a jigsaw rearrangement.Our approach also naturally extends to illusions with more than two views.We provide both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness and flexibility of our method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Please see our project webpage for additional visualizations and results: https://dangeng.github.io/visual_anagrams/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper we tackle the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).Specifically, given a dataset with labelled and unlabelled images, the task is to cluster all images in the unlabelled subset, whether or not they belong to the labelled categories.Our first contribution is to recognize that most existing GCD benchmarks only contain labels for a single clustering of the data, making it difficult to ascertain whether models are using the available labels to solve the GCD task, or simply solving an unsupervised clustering problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As such, we present a synthetic dataset, named 'Clevr-4', for category discovery. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>Clevr-4 contains four equally valid partitions of the data, i.e based on object shape, texture, color or count.To solve the task, models are required to extrapolate the taxonomy specified by the labelled set, rather than simply latching onto a single natural grouping of the data.We use this dataset to demonstrate the limitations of unsupervised clustering in the GCD setting, showing that even very strong unsupervised models fail on Clevr-4.We further use Clevr-4 to examine the weaknesses of existing GCD algorithms, and propose a new method which addresses these shortcomings, leveraging consistent findings from the representation learning literature to do so.Our simple solution, which is based on 'mean teachers' and termed $\mu$GCD, substantially outperforms implemented baselines on Clevr-4.Finally, when we transfer these findings to real data on the challenging Semantic Shift Benchmark (SSB), we find that $\mu$GCD outperforms all prior work, setting a new state-of-the-art.For the project webpage, see https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/clevr4/</p>

                  <p>Contrastive learning has proven to be an effective method for pre-training models using weakly labeled data in the vision domain.Sentence transformers are the NLP counterparts to this architecture, and have been growing in popularity due to their rich and effective sentence representations.Having effective sentence representations is paramount in multiple tasks, such as information retrieval, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and sentence comparison.Keeping in mind the deployability factor of transformers, evaluating the robustness of sentence transformers is of utmost importance.This work focuses on evaluating the robustness of the sentence encoders.We employ several adversarial attacks to evaluate its robustness.This system uses character-level attacks in the form of random character substitution, word-level attacks in the form of synonym replacement, and sentence-level attacks in the form of intra-sentence word order shuffling.The results of the experiments strongly undermine the robustness of sentence encoders.The models produce significantly different predictions as well as embeddings on perturbed datasets.The accuracy of the models can fall up to 15 percent on perturbed datasets as compared to unperturbed datasets.Furthermore, the experiments demonstrate that these embeddings does capture the semantic and syntactic structure (sentence order) of sentences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing supervised classification strategies fail to leverage this information, and merely function as n-gram detectors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of latent variable models is often recast as an optimization problem over the extended space of parameters and probability distributions.For example, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm can be interpreted as coordinate descent applied to a suitable free energy functional over this space.Recently, this perspective has been combined with insights from optimal transport and Wasserstein gradient flows to develop particle-based algorithms applicable to wider classes of models than standard EM.   Drawing inspiration from prior works which interpret `momentum-enriched' optimisation algorithms as discretizations of ordinary differential equations, we propose an analogous dynamical systems-inspired approach to minimizing the free energy functional over the extended space of parameters and probability distributions.The result is a dynamic system that blends elements of Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient method, the underdamped Langevin diffusion, and particle methods.   Under suitable assumptions, we establish quantitative convergence of the proposed system to the unique minimiser of the functional in continuous time.We then propose a numerical discretization of this system which enables its application to parameter estimation in latent variable models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting algorithm converges faster than existing methods and compares favourably with other (approximate) MLE algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span></p>

                  <p>The field of 4D point cloud understanding is rapidly developing with the goal of analyzing dynamic 3D point cloud sequences.However, it remains a challenging task due to the sparsity and lack of texture in point clouds.Moreover, the irregularity of point cloud poses a difficulty in aligning temporal information within video sequences.To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-modal knowledge transfer framework, called X4D-SceneFormer.This framework enhances 4D-Scene understanding by transferring texture priors from RGB sequences using a Transformer architecture with temporal relationship mining.Specifically, the framework is designed with a dual-branch architecture, consisting of an 4D point cloud transformer and a Gradient-aware Image Transformer (GIT).During training, we employ multiple knowledge transfer techniques, including temporal consistency losses and masked self-attention, to strengthen the knowledge transfer between modalities.This leads to enhanced performance during inference using single-modal 4D point cloud inputs.Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our framework on various 4D point cloud video understanding tasks, including action recognition, action segmentation and semantic segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results achieve 1st places, i.e., 85.3% (+7.9%) accuracy and 47.3% (+5.0%) <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>mIoU for 4D action segmentation and semantic segmentation, on the HOI4D challenge\footnote{\url{http://www.hoi4d.top/}.}, outperforming previous state-of-the-art by a large margin.We release the code at https://github.com/jinglinglingling/X4D</p>

                  <p>We present an algorithm for creating an n-level ray-space hierarchy (RSH) of coherent rays that runs on the GPU.Our algorithm uses rasterization to process the primary rays, then uses those results as the inputs for a RSH, that processes the secondary rays.The RSH algorithm generates bundles of rays; hashes them, according to their attributes; and sorts them.Thus we generate a ray list with adjacent coherent rays.To improve the rendering performance of the RSH vs a more classical approach.In addition the scenes geometry is partitioned into a set of bounding spheres, intersected with the RSH, to further decrease the amount of false ray bundle-primitive intersection tests.We show that our technique notably reduces the amount of ray-primitive intersection tests, required to render an image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, it performs up to 50% better in this metric than other algorithms in this class. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span></p>

                  <p>Knowing how many and where are people in various indoor spaces is critical for reducing HVAC energy waste, space management, spatial analytics and in emergency scenarios.While a range of technologies have been proposed to detect and track people in large indoor spaces, ceiling-mounted fisheye cameras have recently emerged as strong contenders.Currently, RAPiD is the SOTA algorithm for people detection in images captured by fisheye cameras.However, in large spaces several overhead fisheye cameras are needed to assure high accuracy of counting and thus multiple instances of RAPiD must be executed simultaneously.This report evaluates inference time when multiple instances of RAPiD run in parallel on an Ubuntu NUC PC with Intel I7 8559U CPU.We consider three mechanisms of CPU-resource allocation to handle multiple instances of RAPiD: 1) managed by Ubuntu, 2) managed by user via operating-system calls to assign logical cores, and 3) managed by user via PyTorch-library calls to limit the number of threads used by PyTorch.Each scenario was evaluated on 300 images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results show, that when one or two instances of RAPiD are executed in parallel all three approaches result in similar inference times of 1.8sec and 3.2sec, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>However, when three or more instances of RAPiD run in parallel, limiting the number of threads used by PyTorch results in the shortest inference times.On average, RAPiD completes inference of 2 images simultaneously in about 3sec, 4 images in 6sec and 8 images in less than 14sec.This is important for real-time system design.In HVAC-application scenarios, with a typical reaction time of 10-15min, a latency of 14sec is negligible so a single 8559U CPU can support 8 camera streams thus reducing the system cost.However, in emergency scenarios, when time is of essence, a single CPU may be needed for each camera to reduce the latency to 1.8sec.</p>

                  <p>Flexible antenna systems (FASs) can reconfigure their locations freely within a spatially continuous space.To keep favorable antenna positions, the channel state information (CSI) acquisition for FASs is essential.While some techniques have been proposed, most existing FAS channel estimators require several channel assumptions, such as slow variation and angular-domain sparsity.When these assumptions are not reasonable, the model mismatch may lead to unpredictable performance loss.In this paper, we propose the successive Bayesian reconstructor (S-BAR) as a general solution to estimate FAS channels.Unlike model-based estimators, the proposed S-BAR is prior-aided, which builds the experiential kernel for CSI acquisition.Inspired by Bayesian regression, the key idea of S-BAR is to model the FAS channels as a stochastic process, whose uncertainty can be successively eliminated by kernel-based sampling and regression.In this way, the predictive mean of the regressed stochastic process can be viewed as the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimator of FAS channels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Simulation results verify that, in both model-mismatched and model-matched cases, the proposed S-BAR can achieve higher estimation accuracy than the existing schemes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a notorious alternative to address learning problems dealing with non-Euclidean datasets.However, although most works assume that the graph is perfectly known, the observed topology is prone to errors stemming from observational noise, graph-learning limitations, or adversarial attacks.If ignored, these perturbations may drastically hinder the performance of GNNs.To address this limitation, this work proposes a robust implementation of GNNs that explicitly accounts for the presence of perturbations in the observed topology.For any task involving GNNs, our core idea is to i) solve an optimization problem not only over the learnable parameters of the GNN but also over the true graph, and ii) augment the fitting cost with a term accounting for discrepancies on the graph.Specifically, we consider a convolutional GNN based on graph filters and follow an alternating optimization approach to handle the (non-differentiable and constrained) optimization problem by combining gradient descent and projected proximal updates.The resulting algorithm is not limited to a particular type of graph and is amenable to incorporating prior information about the perturbations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we assess the performance of the proposed method through several numerical experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.776</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multicasting is a vital information dissemination technique in Software-Defined Networking (SDN).With SDN, a multicast service can incorporate network functions implemented at different nodes, which is referred to as software-defined multicast.Emerging ubiquitous wireless networks for 5G and Beyond (B5G) inherently support multicast.However, the broadcast nature of wireless channels, especially in dense deployments, leads to neighborhood interference as a primary system degradation factor, which introduces a new challenge for software-defined multicast in wireless mesh networks.To tackle this, this paper introduces a novel approach, based on the idea of minimizing both the total length cost of the multicast tree and the interference at the same time.Accordingly, a bicriteria optimization problem is formulated, which is called \emph{Minimum Interference Steiner Tree (MIST)}.To solve the bicriteria problem, instead of resorting to heuristics, this paper employs an innovative approach that is an approximate algorithm for MIST but with guaranteed performance.Specifically, the approach is a two-stage relaxation algorithm by exploiting the monotone submodularity property of the interference metric and identifying Pareto optimal solutions for MIST.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Simulation results demonstrate and validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span></p>

                  <p>Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear (with respect to output length) inference complexity.Recent works such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and TransNormerLLM (Qin et al., 2023a) observe that adding a global decay term to the additive RNN update rule greatly improves performance, sometimes outperforming standard Transformers with softmax attention when trained at scale.In this work we show that adding a data-dependent gating mechanism further improves performance.We derive a parallel form of this gated linear attention layer that enables efficient training.However, a straightforward, numerically stable implementation of this parallel form requires generalized matrix multiplications in log-space for numerical stability, and thus cannot take advantage of tensor cores on modern GPUs which are optimized for standard matrix multiplications.We develop a hardware-efficient version of the parallel form that can still make use of tensor cores through block-parallel computations over sequence chunks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on moderate-scale language modeling (340M-parameter models trained on 15B tokens, 1.3B-parameter models trained on 100B tokens) show that gated linear attention (GLA) Transformers perform competitively against a strong LLaMA-architecture Transformer baseline (Touvron et al., 2023) as well as Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023), a recently introduced state-space model with a data-dependent state transition mechanism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>For training speed, our Triton-based implementation performs comparably to CUDA-optimized FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) under the regular 2048 training length setting, while outperforming FlashAttention-2when training on longer sequences beyond 4096.</p>
