                  <p>Capturing and annotating Sign language datasets is a time consuming and costly process.Current datasets are orders of magnitude too small to successfully train unconstrained \acf{slt} models.As a result, research has turned to TV broadcast content as a source of large-scale training data, consisting of both the sign language interpreter and the associated audio subtitle.However, lack of sign language annotation limits the usability of this data and has led to the development of automatic annotation techniques such as sign spotting.These spottings are aligned to the video rather than the subtitle, which often results in a misalignment between the subtitle and spotted signs.In this paper we propose a method for aligning spottings with their corresponding subtitles using large spoken language models.Using a single modality means our method is computationally inexpensive and can be utilized in conjunction with existing alignment techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the \acf{mdgs} and \acf{bobsl} datasets, recovering up to a 33.22 BLEU-1 score in word alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span></p>

                  <p>The abundant biodiversity of coral reefs in Indonesian waters is a valuable asset that needs to be preserved.Rapid climate change and uncontrolled human activities have led to the degradation of coral reef ecosystems, including coral bleaching, which is a critical indicator of coral health conditions.Therefore, this research aims to develop an accurate classification model to distinguish between healthy corals and corals experiencing bleaching.This study utilizes a specialized dataset consisting of 923 images collected from Flickr using the Flickr API.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset comprises two distinct classes: healthy corals (438 images) and bleached corals (485 images). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>These images have been resized to a maximum of 300 pixels in width or height, whichever is larger, to maintain consistent sizes across the dataset.   The method employed in this research involves the use of machine learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN), to recognize and differentiate visual patterns associated with healthy and bleached corals.In this context, the dataset can be used to train and test various classification models to achieve optimal results.By leveraging the ResNet model, it was found that a from-scratch ResNet model can outperform pretrained models in terms of precision and accuracy.The success in developing accurate classification models will greatly benefit researchers and marine biologists in gaining a better understanding of coral reef health.These models can also be employed to monitor changes in the coral reef environment, thereby making a significant contribution to conservation and ecosystem restoration efforts that have far-reaching impacts on life.</p>

                  <p>Event camera-based pattern recognition is a newly arising research topic in recent years.Current researchers usually transform the event streams into images, graphs, or voxels, and adopt deep neural networks for event-based classification.Although good performance can be achieved on simple event recognition datasets, however, their results may be still limited due to the following two issues.Firstly, they adopt spatial sparse event streams for recognition only, which may fail to capture the color and detailed texture information well.Secondly, they adopt either Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) for energy-efficient recognition with suboptimal results, or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for energy-intensive, high-performance recognition.However, seldom of them consider achieving a balance between these two aspects.In this paper, we formally propose to recognize patterns by fusing RGB frames and event streams simultaneously and propose a new RGB frame-event recognition framework to address the aforementioned issues.The proposed method contains four main modules, i.e., memory support Transformer network for RGB frame encoding, spiking neural network for raw event stream encoding, multi-modal bottleneck fusion module for RGB-Event feature aggregation, and prediction head.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Due to the scarce of RGB-Event based classification dataset, we also propose a large-scale PokerEvent dataset which contains 114 classes, and 27102 frame-event pairs recorded using a DVS346 event camera. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.903</span></span>Extensive experiments on two RGB-Event based classification datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.We hope this work will boost the development of pattern recognition by fusing RGB frames and event streams.Both our dataset and source code of this work will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/SSTFormer.</p>

                  <p>Wide-scale use of visual surveillance in public spaces puts individual privacy at stake while increasing resource consumption (energy, bandwidth, and computation).Neuromorphic vision sensors (event-cameras) have been recently considered a valid solution to the privacy issue because they do not capture detailed RGB visual information of the subjects in the scene.However, recent deep learning architectures have been able to reconstruct images from event cameras with high fidelity, reintroducing a potential threat to privacy for event-based vision applications.In this paper, we aim to anonymize event-streams to protect the identity of human subjects against such image reconstruction attacks.To achieve this, we propose an end-to-end network architecture jointly optimized for the twofold objective of preserving privacy and performing a downstream task such as person ReId.Our network learns to scramble events, enforcing the degradation of images recovered from the privacy attacker.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we also bring to the community the first ever event-based person ReId dataset gathered to evaluate the performance of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our approach with extensive experiments and report results on the synthetic event data simulated from the publicly available SoftBio dataset and our proposed Event-ReId dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in understanding and responding to user intents.However, their performance lag behind general use cases in some expertise domains, such as Chinese medicine.Existing efforts to incorporate Chinese medicine into LLMs rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with single-turn and distilled dialogue data.These models lack the ability for doctor-like proactive inquiry and multi-turn comprehension and cannot always align responses with safety and professionalism experts.In this work, we introduce Zhongjing, the first Chinese medical LLaMA-based LLM that implements an entire training pipeline from pre-training to reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we introduce a Chinese multi-turn medical dialogue dataset of 70,000 authentic doctor-patient dialogues, CMtMedQA, which significantly enhances the model's capability for complex dialogue and proactive inquiry initiation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>We define a refined annotation rule and evaluation criteria given the biomedical domain's unique characteristics.Results show that our model outperforms baselines in various capacities and matches the performance of ChatGPT in a few abilities, despite having 50x training data with previous best model and 100x parameters with ChatGPT.RLHF further improves the model's instruction-following ability and safety.We also release our code, datasets and model for further research.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of natural language tasks.However, as these models continue to grow in size, they face significant challenges in terms of computational costs.Additionally, LLMs often lack efficient domain-specific understanding, which is particularly crucial in specialized fields such as aviation and healthcare.To boost the domain-specific understanding, we propose, KITLM, a novel knowledge base integration approach into language model through relevant information infusion.By integrating pertinent knowledge, not only the performance of the language model is greatly enhanced, but the model size requirement is also significantly reduced while achieving comparable performance.Our proposed knowledge-infused model surpasses the performance of both GPT-3.5-turbo and the state-of-the-art knowledge infusion method, SKILL, achieving over 1.5 times improvement in exact match scores on the MetaQA.KITLM showed a similar performance boost in the aviation domain with AeroQA.The drastic performance improvement of KITLM over the existing methods can be attributed to the infusion of relevant knowledge while mitigating noise.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we release two curated datasets to accelerate knowledge infusion research in specialized fields: a) AeroQA, a new benchmark dataset designed for multi-hop question-answering within the aviation domain, and b) Aviation Corpus, a dataset constructed from unstructured text extracted from the National Transportation Safety Board reports. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>Our research contributes to advancing the field of domain-specific language understanding and showcases the potential of knowledge infusion techniques in improving the performance of language models on question-answering.</p>

                  <p>Fusarium head blight is a devastating disease that causes significant economic losses annually on small grains.Efficiency, accuracy, and timely detection of FHB in the resistance screening are critical for wheat and barley breeding programs.In recent years, various image processing techniques have been developed using supervised machine learning algorithms for the early detection of FHB.The state-of-the-art convolutional neural network-based methods, such as U-Net, employ a series of encoding blocks to create a local representation and a series of decoding blocks to capture the semantic relations.However, these methods are not often capable of long-range modeling dependencies inside the input data, and their ability to model multi-scale objects with significant variations in texture and shape is limited.Vision transformers as alternative architectures with innate global self-attention mechanisms for sequence-to-sequence prediction, due to insufficient low-level details, may also limit localization capabilities.To overcome these limitations, a new Context Bridge is proposed to integrate the local representation capability of the U-Net network in the transformer model.In addition, the standard attention mechanism of the original transformer is replaced with Efficient Self-attention, which is less complicated than other state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To train the proposed network, 12,000 wheat images from an FHB-inoculated wheat field at the SDSU research farm in Volga, SD, were captured. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>In addition to healthy and unhealthy plants, these images encompass various stages of the disease.A team of expert pathologists annotated the images for training and evaluating the developed model.As a result, the effectiveness of the transformer-based method for FHB-disease detection, through extensive experiments across typical tasks for plant image segmentation, is demonstrated.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces an approach that combines the language reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with the benefits of local training to tackle complex, domain-specific tasks.Specifically, the authors demonstrate their approach by extracting structured condition codes from pathology reports.The proposed approach utilizes local LLMs, which can be fine-tuned to respond to specific generative instructions and provide structured outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The authors collected a dataset of over 150k uncurated surgical pathology reports, containing gross descriptions, final diagnoses, and condition codes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span>They trained different model architectures, including LLaMA, BERT and LongFormer and evaluated their performance.The results show that the LLaMA-based models significantly outperform BERT-style models across all evaluated metrics, even with extremely reduced precision.The LLaMA models performed especially well with large datasets, demonstrating their ability to handle complex, multi-label tasks.Overall, this work presents an effective approach for utilizing LLMs to perform domain-specific tasks using accessible hardware, with potential applications in the medical domain, where complex data extraction and classification are required.</p>

                  <p>Segmentation is a fundamental problem in surgical scene analysis using artificial intelligence.However, the inherent data scarcity in this domain makes it challenging to adapt traditional segmentation techniques for this task.To tackle this issue, current research employs pretrained models and finetunes them on the given data.Even so, these require training deep networks with millions of parameters every time new data becomes available.A recently published foundation model, Segment-Anything (SAM), generalizes well to a large variety of natural images, hence tackling this challenge to a reasonable extent.However, SAM does not generalize well to the medical domain as is without utilizing a large amount of compute resources for fine-tuning and using task-specific prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, these prompts are in the form of bounding-boxes or foreground/background points that need to be annotated explicitly for every image, making this solution increasingly tedious with higher data size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>In this work, we propose AdaptiveSAM - an adaptive modification of SAM that can adjust to new datasets quickly and efficiently, while enabling text-prompted segmentation.For finetuning AdaptiveSAM, we propose an approach called bias-tuning that requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than SAM (less than 2\%).At the same time, AdaptiveSAM requires negligible expert intervention since it uses free-form text as prompt and can segment the object of interest with just the label name as prompt.Our experiments show that AdaptiveSAM outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on various medical imaging datasets including surgery, ultrasound and X-ray.Code is available at https://github.com/JayParanjape/biastuning</p>

                  <p>Multi-label image recognition in the low-label regime is a task of great challenge and practical significance.Previous works have focused on learning the alignment between textual and visual spaces to compensate for limited image labels, yet may suffer from reduced accuracy due to the scarcity of high-quality multi-label annotations.In this research, we leverage the powerful alignment between textual and visual features pretrained with millions of auxiliary image-text pairs.We introduce an efficient and effective framework called Evidence-guided Dual Context Optimization (DualCoOp++), which serves as a unified approach for addressing partial-label and zero-shot multi-label recognition.In DualCoOp++ we separately encode evidential, positive, and negative contexts for target classes as parametric components of the linguistic input (i.e., prompts).The evidential context aims to discover all the related visual content for the target class, and serves as guidance to aggregate positive and negative contexts from the spatial domain of the image, enabling better distinguishment between similar categories.Additionally, we introduce a Winner-Take-All module that promotes inter-class interaction during training, while avoiding the need for extra parameters and costs.As DualCoOp++ imposes minimal additional learnable overhead on the pretrained vision-language framework, it enables rapid adaptation to multi-label recognition tasks with limited annotations and even unseen classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on standard multi-label recognition benchmarks across two challenging low-label settings demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a well-known method for exposing bugs/vulnerabilities in software systems.Popular fuzzers, such as AFL, use a biased random search over the domain of program inputs, where 100s or 1000s of inputs (test cases) are executed per second in order to expose bugs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If a bug is discovered, it can either be fixed manually by the developer or fixed automatically using an Automated Program Repair (APR) tool. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Like fuzzing, many existing APR tools are search-based, but over the domain of patches rather than inputs.   In this paper, we propose search-based program repair as patch-level fuzzing.The basic idea is to adapt a fuzzer (AFL) to fuzz over the patch space rather than the input space.Thus we use a patch-space fuzzer to explore a patch space, while using a traditional input level fuzzer to rule out patch candidates and help in patch selection.To improve the throughput, we propose a compilation-free patch validation methodology, where we execute the original (unpatched) program natively, then selectively interpret only the specific patched statements and expressions.Since this avoids (re)compilation, we show that compilation-free patch validation can achieve a similar throughput as input-level fuzzing (100s or 1000s of execs/sec).We show that patch-level fuzzing and input-level fuzzing can be combined, for a co-exploration of both spaces in order to find better quality patches.Such a collaboration between input-level fuzzing and patch-level fuzzing is then employed to search over candidate fix locations, as well as patch candidates in each fix location.</p>

                  <p>The aggregation of multiple opinions plays a crucial role in decision-making, such as in hiring and loan review, and in labeling data for supervised learning.Although majority voting and existing opinion aggregation models are effective for simple tasks, they are inappropriate for tasks without objectively true labels in which disagreements may occur.In particular, when voter attributes such as gender or race introduce bias into opinions, the aggregation results may vary depending on the composition of voter attributes.A balanced group of voters is desirable for fair aggregation results but may be difficult to prepare.In this study, we consider methods to achieve fair opinion aggregation based on voter attributes and evaluate the fairness of the aggregated results.To this end, we consider an approach that combines opinion aggregation models such as majority voting and the Dawid and Skene model (D&S model) with fairness options such as sample weighting.To evaluate the fairness of opinion aggregation, probabilistic soft labels are preferred over discrete class labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we address the problem of soft label estimation without considering voter attributes and identify some issues with the D&S model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>To address these limitations, we propose a new Soft D&S model with improved accuracy in estimating soft labels.Moreover, we evaluated the fairness of an opinion aggregation model, including Soft D&S, in combination with different fairness options using synthetic and semi-synthetic data.The experimental results suggest that the combination of Soft D&S and data splitting as a fairness option is effective for dense data, whereas weighted majority voting is effective for sparse data.These findings should prove particularly valuable in supporting decision-making by human and machine-learning models with balanced opinion aggregation.</p>

We explore vulnerabilities in the design of DeFi platform's governance protocols and analyze different governance attacks, focusing on the transferable nature of voting rights via governance tokens.Following the movement and holdings of governance tokens, we show they are often used to perform a single action and then sold off.We present evidence of DeFi platforms using other platforms' governance protocols to promote their own agenda at the expense of the host platform.</p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) is a technique that allows multiple participants to collaboratively train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) without the need of centralizing their data.Among other advantages, it comes with privacy-preserving properties making it attractive for application in sensitive contexts, such as health care or the military.Although the data are not explicitly exchanged, the training procedure requires sharing information about participants' models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This makes the individual models vulnerable to theft or unauthorized distribution by malicious actors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the issue of ownership rights protection in the context of Machine Learning (ML), DNN Watermarking methods have been developed during the last five years. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>Most existing works have focused on watermarking in a centralized manner, but only a few methods have been designed for FL and its unique constraints.In this paper, we provide an overview of recent advancements in Federated Learning watermarking, shedding light on the new challenges and opportunities that arise in this field.</p>

                  <p>The adaptive immune system's T and B cells can be viewed as large populations of simple, diverse classifiers.Artificial immune systems (AIS) $\unicode{x2013}$ algorithmic models of T or B cell repertoires $\unicode{x2013}$ are used in both computational biology and natural computing to investigate how the immune system adapts to its changing environments.However, researchers have struggled to build such systems at scale.For string-based AISs, finite state machines (FSMs) can store cell repertoires in compressed representations that are orders of magnitude smaller than explicitly stored receptor sets.This strategy allows AISs with billions of receptors to be generated in a matter of seconds.However, to date, these FSM-based AISs have been unable to deal with multiplicity in input data.Here, we show how weighted FSMs can be used to represent cell repertoires and model immunological processes like negative and positive selection, while also taking into account the multiplicity of input data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We use our method to build simple immune-inspired classifier systems that solve various toy problems in anomaly detection, showing how weights can be crucial for both performance and robustness to parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>Our approach can potentially be extended to increase the scale of other population-based machine learning algorithms such as learning classifier systems.</p>
