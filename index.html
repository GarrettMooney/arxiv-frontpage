                  <p>Knowledge graph embeddings are dense numerical representations of entities in a knowledge graph (KG).While the majority of approaches concentrate only on relational information, i.e., relations between entities, fewer approaches exist which also take information about literal values (e.g., textual descriptions or numerical information) into account.Those which exist are typically tailored towards a particular modality of literal and a particular embedding method.In this paper, we propose a set of universal preprocessing operators which can be used to transform KGs with literals for numerical, temporal, textual, and image information, so that the transformed KGs can be embedded with any method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results on the kgbench dataset with three different embedding methods show promising results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.787</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current scene graph datasets suffer from strong long-tail distributions of their predicate classes.Due to a very low number of some predicate classes in the test sets, no reliable metrics can be retrieved for the rarest classes.We construct a new panoptic scene graph dataset and a set of metrics that are designed as a benchmark for the predictive performance especially on rare predicate classes.To construct the new dataset, we propose a model-assisted annotation pipeline that efficiently finds rare predicate classes that are hidden in a large set of images like needles in a haystack.   Contrary to prior scene graph datasets, Haystack contains explicit negative annotations, i.e. annotations that a given relation does not have a certain predicate class.Negative annotations are helpful especially in the field of scene graph generation and open up a whole new set of possibilities to improve current scene graph generation models.   Haystack is 100% compatible with existing panoptic scene graph datasets and can easily be integrated with existing evaluation pipelines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code can be found here: https://lorjul.github.io/haystack/.

                  <p>Estimating the transferability of publicly available pretrained models to a target task has assumed an important place for transfer learning tasks in recent years.Existing efforts propose metrics that allow a user to choose one model from a pool of pre-trained models without having to fine-tune each model individually and identify one explicitly.With the growth in the number of available pre-trained models and the popularity of model ensembles, it also becomes essential to study the transferability of multiple-source models for a given target task.The few existing efforts study transferability in such multi-source ensemble settings using just the outputs of the classification layer and neglect possible domain or task mismatch.Moreover, they overlook the most important factor while selecting the source models, viz., the cohesiveness factor between them, which can impact the performance and confidence in the prediction of the ensemble.To address these gaps, we propose a novel Optimal tranSport-based suBmOdular tRaNsferability metric (OSBORN) to estimate the transferability of an ensemble of models to a downstream task.OSBORN collectively accounts for image domain difference, task difference, and cohesiveness of models in the ensemble to provide reliable estimates of transferability.We gauge the performance of OSBORN on both image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our setup includes 28 source datasets, 11 target datasets, 5 model architectures, and 2 pre-training methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span>We benchmark our method against current state-of-the-art metrics MS-LEEP and E-LEEP, and outperform them consistently using the proposed approach.</p>

                  <p>Sketch-based terrain generation seeks to create realistic landscapes for virtual environments in various applications such as computer games, animation and virtual reality.Recently, deep learning based terrain generation has emerged, notably the ones based on generative adversarial networks (GAN).However, these methods often struggle to fulfill the requirements of flexible user control and maintain generative diversity for realistic terrain.Therefore, we propose a novel diffusion-based method, namely terrain diffusion network (TDN), which actively incorporates user guidance for enhanced controllability, taking into account terrain features like rivers, ridges, basins, and peaks.Instead of adhering to a conventional monolithic denoising process, which often compromises the fidelity of terrain details or the alignment with user control, a multi-level denoising scheme is proposed to generate more realistic terrains by taking into account fine-grained details, particularly those related to climatic patterns influenced by erosion and tectonic activities.Specifically, three terrain synthesisers are designed for structural, intermediate, and fine-grained level denoising purposes, which allow each synthesiser concentrate on a distinct terrain aspect.Moreover, to maximise the efficiency of our TDN, we further introduce terrain and sketch latent spaces for the synthesizers with pre-trained terrain autoencoders.Comprehensive experiments on a new dataset constructed from NASA Topology Images clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset will be publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.925</span></span></p>

                  <p>Amodal object segmentation is a challenging task that involves segmenting both visible and occluded parts of an object.In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Coarse-to-Fine Segmentation (C2F-Seg), that addresses this problem by progressively modeling the amodal segmentation.C2F-Seg initially reduces the learning space from the pixel-level image space to the vector-quantized latent space.This enables us to better handle long-range dependencies and learn a coarse-grained amodal segment from visual features and visible segments.However, this latent space lacks detailed information about the object, which makes it difficult to provide a precise segmentation directly.To address this issue, we propose a convolution refine module to inject fine-grained information and provide a more precise amodal object segmentation based on visual features and coarse-predicted segmentation.To help the studies of amodal object segmentation, we create a synthetic amodal dataset, named as MOViD-Amodal (MOViD-A), which can be used for both image and video amodal object segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We extensively evaluate our model on two benchmark datasets: KINS and COCO-A.

                  <p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently witnessed rapid advancements, exhibiting a remarkable capacity for perceiving, understanding, and processing visual information by connecting visual receptor with large language models (LLMs).However, current assessments mainly focus on recognizing and reasoning abilities, lacking direct evaluation of conversational skills and neglecting visual storytelling abilities.In this paper, we propose an evaluation method that uses strong LLMs as judges to comprehensively evaluate the various abilities of LVLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, we construct a comprehensive visual dialogue dataset TouchStone, consisting of open-world images and questions, covering five major categories of abilities and 27 subtasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset not only covers fundamental recognition and comprehension but also extends to literary creation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>Secondly, by integrating detailed image annotations we effectively transform the multimodal input content into a form understandable by LLMs.This enables us to employ advanced LLMs for directly evaluating the quality of the multimodal dialogue without requiring human intervention.Through validation, we demonstrate that powerful LVLMs, such as GPT-4, can effectively score dialogue quality by leveraging their textual capabilities alone, aligning with human preferences.We hope our work can serve as a touchstone for LVLMs' evaluation and pave the way for building stronger LVLMs.The evaluation code is available at https://github.com/OFA-Sys/TouchStone.</p>

                  <p>Robust and efficient learning remains a challenging problem in robotics, in particular with complex visual inputs.Inspired by human attention mechanism, with which we quickly process complex visual scenes and react to changes in the environment, we think that embedding auxiliary information about focus point into robot learning would enhance efficiency and robustness of the learning process.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model and emulate the human attention with an approximate prediction model.We then leverage this output and feed it as a structured auxiliary feature map into downstream learning tasks.We validate this idea by learning a prediction model from human-gaze recordings of manual driving in the real world.We test our approach on two learning tasks - object detection and imitation learning.Our experiments demonstrate that the inclusion of predicted human attention leads to improved robustness of the trained models to out-of-distribution samples and faster learning in low-data regime settings.Our work highlights the potential of incorporating structured auxiliary information in representation learning for robotics and opens up new avenues for research in this direction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and data are available online. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span></p>

                  <p>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for securing face recognition systems.However, existing FAS methods with handcrafted binary or pixel-wise labels have limitations due to diverse presentation attacks (PAs).In this paper, we propose an attack type robust face anti-spoofing framework under light flash, called ATR-FAS.Due to imaging differences caused by various attack types, traditional FAS methods based on single binary classification network may result in excessive intra-class distance of spoof faces, leading to a challenge of decision boundary learning.Therefore, we employed multiple networks to reconstruct multi-frame depth maps as auxiliary supervision, and each network experts in one type of attack.A dual gate module (DGM) consisting of a type gate and a frame-attention gate is introduced, which perform attack type recognition and multi-frame attention generation, respectively.The outputs of DGM are utilized as weight to mix the result of multiple expert networks.The multi-experts mixture enables ATR-FAS to generate spoof-differentiated depth maps, and stably detects spoof faces without being affected by different types of PAs.Moreover, we design a differential normalization procedure to convert original flash frames into differential frames.This simple but effective processing enhances the details in flash frames, aiding in the generation of depth maps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To verify the effectiveness of our framework, we collected a large-scale dataset containing 12,660 live and spoof videos with diverse PAs under dynamic flash from the smartphone screen. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span>Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ATR-FAS significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/Chaochao-Lin/ATR-FAS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span></p>

                  <p>The robustness of object detection models is a major concern when applied to real-world scenarios.However, the performance of most object detection models degrades when applied to images subjected to corruptions, since they are usually trained and evaluated on clean datasets.Enhancing the robustness of object detection models is of utmost importance, especially for those designed for aerial images, which feature complex backgrounds, substantial variations in scales and orientations of objects.This paper addresses the challenge of assessing the robustness of object detection models in aerial images, with a specific emphasis on scenarios where images are affected by clouds.In this study, we introduce two novel benchmarks based on DOTA-v1.0.The first benchmark encompasses 19 prevalent corruptions, while the second focuses on cloud-corrupted images-a phenomenon uncommon in natural pictures yet frequent in aerial photography.We systematically evaluate the robustness of mainstream object detection models and perform numerous ablation experiments.Through our investigations, we find that enhanced model architectures, larger networks, well-crafted modules, and judicious data augmentation strategies collectively enhance the robustness of aerial object detection models.The benchmarks we propose and our comprehensive experimental analyses can facilitate research on robust object detection in aerial images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Codes and datasets are available at: (https://github.com/hehaodong530/DOTA-C) <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Software developers often struggle to update APIs, leading to manual, time-consuming, and error-prone processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>We introduce MELT, a new approach that generates lightweight API migration rules directly from pull requests in popular library repositories.Our key insight is that pull requests merged into open-source libraries are a rich source of information sufficient to mine API migration rules.By leveraging code examples mined from the library source and automatically generated code examples based on the pull requests, we infer transformation rules in \comby, a language for structural code search and replace.Since inferred rules from single code examples may be too specific, we propose a generalization procedure to make the rules more applicable to client projects.MELT rules are syntax-driven, interpretable, and easily adaptable.Moreover, unlike previous work, our approach enables rule inference to seamlessly integrate into the library workflow, removing the need to wait for client code migrations.We evaluated MELT on pull requests from four popular libraries, successfully mining 461 migration rules from code examples in pull requests and 114 rules from auto-generated code examples.Our generalization procedure increases the number of matches for mined rules by 9x.We applied these rules to client projects and ran their tests, which led to an overall decrease in the number of warnings and fixing some test cases demonstrating MELT's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.</p>
