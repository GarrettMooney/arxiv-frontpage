                  <p>This paper presents a follow-up study to OpenAI's recent superalignment work on Weak-to-Strong Generalization (W2SG).Superalignment focuses on ensuring that high-level AI systems remain consistent with human values and intentions when dealing with complex, high-risk tasks.The W2SG framework has opened new possibilities for empirical research in this evolving field.Our study simulates two phases of superalignment under the W2SG framework: the development of general superhuman models and the progression towards superintelligence.In the first phase, based on human supervision, the quality of weak supervision is enhanced through a combination of scalable oversight and ensemble learning, reducing the capability gap between weak teachers and strong students.In the second phase, an automatic alignment evaluator is employed as the weak supervisor.By recursively updating this auto aligner, the capabilities of the weak teacher models are synchronously enhanced, achieving weak-to-strong supervision over stronger student models.We also provide an initial validation of the proposed approach for the first phase.Using the SciQ task as example, we explore ensemble learning for weak teacher models through bagging and boosting.Scalable oversight is explored through two auxiliary settings: human-AI interaction and AI-AI debate.Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of improved weak supervision on enhancing weak-to-strong generalization based on in-context learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiment code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/W2SG. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D neural implicit representations play a significant component in many robotic applications.However, reconstructing neural radiance fields (NeRF) from realistic event data remains a challenge due to the sparsities and the lack of information when only event streams are available.In this paper, we utilize motion, geometry, and density priors behind event data to impose strong physical constraints to augment NeRF training.The proposed novel pipeline can directly benefit from those priors to reconstruct 3D scenes without additional inputs.Moreover, we present a novel density-guided patch-based sampling strategy for robust and efficient learning, which not only accelerates training procedures but also conduces to expressions of local geometries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More importantly, we establish the first large dataset for event-based 3D reconstruction, which contains 101 objects with various materials and geometries, along with the groundtruth of images and depth maps for all camera viewpoints, which significantly facilitates other research in the related fields. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.903</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/Mercerai/PAEv3d. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span></p>

                  <p>Point-based object localization (POL), which pursues high-performance object sensing under low-cost data annotation, has attracted increased attention.However, the point annotation mode inevitably introduces semantic variance due to the inconsistency of annotated points.Existing POL heavily rely on strict annotation rules, which are difficult to define and apply, to handle the problem.In this study, we propose coarse point refinement (CPR), which to our best knowledge is the first attempt to alleviate semantic variance from an algorithmic perspective.CPR reduces the semantic variance by selecting a semantic centre point in a neighbourhood region to replace the initial annotated point.Furthermore, We design a sampling region estimation module to dynamically compute a sampling region for each object and use a cascaded structure to achieve end-to-end optimization.We further integrate a variance regularization into the structure to concentrate the predicted scores, yielding CPR++.We observe that CPR++ can obtain scale information and further reduce the semantic variance in a global region, thus guaranteeing high-performance object localization.Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets validate the effectiveness of both CPR and CPR++.We hope our work can inspire more research on designing algorithms rather than annotation rules to address the semantic variance problem in POL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code will be public at github.com/ucas-vg/PointTinyBenchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span></p>

                  <p>Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (DocRTE) is a fundamental task in information systems that aims to simultaneously extract entities with semantic relations from a document.Existing methods heavily rely on a substantial amount of fully labeled data.However, collecting and annotating data for newly emerging relations is time-consuming and labor-intensive.Recent advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, exhibit impressive long-text generation capabilities, inspiring us to explore an alternative approach for obtaining auto-labeled documents with new relations.In this paper, we propose a Zero-shot Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (ZeroDocRTE) framework, which generates labeled data by retrieval and denoising knowledge from LLMs, called GenRDK.Specifically, we propose a chain-of-retrieval prompt to guide ChatGPT to generate labeled long-text data step by step.To improve the quality of synthetic data, we propose a denoising strategy based on the consistency of cross-document knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging our denoised synthetic data, we proceed to fine-tune the LLaMA2-13B-Chat for extracting document-level relation triplets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>We perform experiments for both zero-shot document-level relation and triplet extraction on two public datasets.The experimental results illustrate that our GenRDK framework outperforms strong baselines.</p>

                  <p>Roadside unit (RSU) can significantly improve the safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication.Currently, the usage of a single RSU mainly focuses on real-time inference and V2X collaboration, while neglecting the potential value of the high-quality data collected by RSU sensors.Integrating the vast amounts of data from numerous RSUs can provide a rich source of data for model training.However, the absence of ground truth annotations and the difficulty of transmitting enormous volumes of data are two inevitable barriers to fully exploiting this hidden value.In this paper, we introduce FedRSU, an innovative federated learning framework for self-supervised scene flow estimation.In FedRSU, we present a recurrent self-supervision training paradigm, where for each RSU, the scene flow prediction of points at every timestamp can be supervised by its subsequent future multi-modality observation.Another key component of FedRSU is federated learning, where multiple devices collaboratively train an ML model while keeping the training data local and private.With the power of the recurrent self-supervised learning paradigm, FL is able to leverage innumerable underutilized data from RSU.To verify the FedRSU framework, we construct a large-scale multi-modality dataset RSU-SF.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset consists of 17 RSU clients, covering various scenarios, modalities, and sensor settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span>Based on RSU-SF, we show that FedRSU can greatly improve model performance in ITS and provide a comprehensive benchmark under diverse FL scenarios.To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first real-world LiDAR-camera multi-modal dataset and benchmark for the FL community.</p>

Additionally, we simply apply red teaming alignment to LLaVA-v1.5 with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) using RTVLM, and this bolsters the models' performance with 10% in RTVLM test set, 13% in MM-Hal, and without noticeable decline in MM-Bench, overpassing other LLaVA-based models with regular alignment data.This reveals that current open-sourced VLMs still lack red teaming alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets will be open-source. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their unparalleled ability to perform various natural language processing tasks.These models, benefiting from their advanced natural language understanding capabilities, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance.However, the pre-training data utilized in LLMs is often confined to a specific corpus, resulting in inherent freshness and temporal scope limitations.Consequently, this raises concerns regarding the effectiveness of LLMs for tasks involving temporal intents.In this study, we aim to investigate the underlying limitations of general-purpose LLMs when deployed for tasks that require a temporal understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We pay particular attention to handling factual temporal knowledge through three popular temporal QA datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>Specifically, we observe low performance on detailed questions about the past and, surprisingly, for rather new information.In manual and automatic testing, we find multiple temporal errors and characterize the conditions under which QA performance deteriorates.Our analysis contributes to understanding LLM limitations and offers valuable insights into developing future models that can better cater to the demands of temporally-oriented tasks.The code is available\footnote{https://github.com/jwallat/temporalblindspots}.</p>

                  <p>Background: Pain assessment in individuals with neurological conditions, especially those with limited self-report ability and altered facial expressions, presents challenges.Existing measures, relying on direct observation by caregivers, lack sensitivity and specificity.In cerebral palsy, pain is a common comorbidity and a reliable evaluation protocol is crucial.Thus, having an automatic system that recognizes facial expressions could be of enormous help when diagnosing pain in this type of patient.   Objectives: 1) to build a dataset of facial pain expressions in individuals with cerebral palsy, and 2) to develop an automated facial recognition system based on deep learning for pain assessment addressed to this population.   Methods: Ten neural networks were trained on three pain image databases, including the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database, the Multimodal Intensity Pain Dataset, and the Delaware Pain Database.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, a curated dataset (CPPAIN) was created, consisting of 109 preprocessed facial pain expression images from individuals with cerebral palsy, categorized by two physiotherapists using the Facial Action Coding System observational scale.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>Results: InceptionV3 exhibited promising performance on the CP-PAIN dataset, achieving an accuracy of 62.67% and an F1 score of 61.12%.Explainable artificial intelligence techniques revealed consistent essential features for pain identification across models.   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models for robust pain detection in populations with neurological conditions and communication disabilities.The creation of a larger dataset specific to cerebral palsy would further enhance model accuracy, offering a valuable tool for discerning subtle and idiosyncratic pain expressions.The insights gained could extend to other complex neurological conditions.</p>

                  <p>3D vision-language grounding, which focuses on aligning language with the 3D physical environment, stands as a cornerstone in the development of embodied agents.In comparison to recent advancements in the 2D domain, grounding language in 3D scenes faces several significant challenges: (i) the inherent complexity of 3D scenes due to the diverse object configurations, their rich attributes, and intricate relationships; (ii) the scarcity of paired 3D vision-language data to support grounded learning; and (iii) the absence of a unified learning framework to distill knowledge from grounded 3D data.In this work, we aim to address these three major challenges in 3D vision-language by examining the potential of systematically upscaling 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse, encompassing about 68K 3D indoor scenes and comprising 2.5M vision-language pairs derived from both human annotations and our scalable scene-graph-based generation approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.917</span></span>We demonstrate that this scaling allows for a unified pre-training framework, Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), for 3D vision-language learning.Through extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of GPS by achieving state-of-the-art performance on all existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks.The vast potential of SceneVerse and GPS is unveiled through zero-shot transfer experiments in the challenging 3D vision-language tasks.Project website: https://scene-verse.github.io .</p>

This process was guided by our ontology and involved a thorough automatic and manual filtering process, yielding a set of 216 maths problems.We conducted comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs on MORE.The results show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions.This strongly suggests that current LLMs lack robust mathematical skills and deep reasoning abilities.This research not only identifies multiple gaps in the capabilities of current models, but also highlights multiple potential directions for future development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset will be made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/GSM8k_MORE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span></p>

                  <p>Generating sufficient labeled data is a significant hurdle in the efficient execution of deep learning projects, especially in uncharted territories of image segmentation where labeling demands extensive time, unlike classification tasks.Our study confronts this challenge, operating in an environment constrained by limited hardware resources and the lack of extensive datasets or pre-trained models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the novel use of Inconsistency Masks (IM) to effectively filter uncertainty in image-pseudo-label pairs, substantially elevating segmentation quality beyond traditional semi-supervised learning techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>By integrating IM with other methods, we demonstrate remarkable binary segmentation performance on the ISIC 2018 dataset, starting with just 10% labeled data.Notably, three of our hybrid models outperform those trained on the fully labeled dataset.Our approach consistently achieves exceptional results across three additional datasets and shows further improvement when combined with other techniques.For comprehensive and robust evaluation, this paper includes an extensive analysis of prevalent semi-supervised learning strategies, all trained under identical starting conditions.The full code is available at: https://github.com/MichaelVorndran/InconsistencyMasks</p>

                  <p>Without human annotations, a typical Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection (UVAD) method needs to train two models that generate pseudo labels for each other.In previous work, the two models are closely entangled with each other, and it is not known how to upgrade their method without modifying their training framework significantly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, previous work usually adopts fixed thresholding to obtain pseudo labels, however the user-specified threshold is not reliable which inevitably introduces errors into the training process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>To alleviate these two problems, we propose a novel interleaved framework that alternately trains a One-Class Classification (OCC) model and a Weakly-Supervised (WS) model for UVAD.The OCC or WS models in our method can be easily replaced with other OCC or WS models, which facilitates our method to upgrade with the most recent developments in both fields.For handling the fixed thresholding problem, we break through the conventional cognitive boundary and propose a weighted OCC model that can be trained on both normal and abnormal data.We also propose an adaptive mechanism for automatically finding the optimal threshold for the WS model in a loose to strict manner.Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UVAD method outperforms previous approaches.</p>

                  <p>In an era where test-time adaptation methods increasingly rely on the nuanced manipulation of batch normalization (BN) parameters, one critical assumption often goes overlooked: that of independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>test batches with respect to unknown labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>This assumption culminates in biased estimates of BN statistics and jeopardizes system stability under non-i.i.d. conditions.This paper pioneers a departure from the i.i.d. paradigm by introducing a groundbreaking strategy termed "Un-Mixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics" (UnMix-TNS).UnMix-TNS re-calibrates the instance-wise statistics used to normalize each instance in a batch by mixing it with multiple unmixed statistics components, thus inherently simulating the i.i.d. environment.The key lies in our innovative online unmixing procedure, which persistently refines these statistics components by drawing upon the closest instances from an incoming test batch.Remarkably generic in its design, UnMix-TNS seamlessly integrates with an array of state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods and pre-trained architectures equipped with BN layers.Empirical evaluations corroborate the robustness of UnMix-TNS under varied scenarios ranging from single to continual and mixed domain shifts.UnMix-TNS stands out when handling test data streams with temporal correlation, including those with corrupted real-world non-i.i.d. streams, sustaining its efficacy even with minimal batch sizes and individual samples.Our results set a new standard for test-time adaptation, demonstrating significant improvements in both stability and performance across multiple benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>One of the most important challenges of Smart City Applications is to adapt the system to interact with non-expert users.Robot imitation frameworks aim to simplify and reduce times of robot programming by allowing users to program directly through demonstrations.In classical frameworks, actions are modeled using joint or Cartesian space trajectories.Other features, such as visual ones, are not always well represented with these pure geometrical approaches.Continuous Goal-Directed Actions (CGDA) is an alternative to these methods, as it encodes actions as changes of any feature that can be extracted from the environment.As a consequence of this, the robot joint trajectories for execution must be fully computed to comply with this feature-agnostic encoding.This is achieved using Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), which usually requires too many evaluations to perform this evolution step in the actual robot.Current strategies involve performing evaluations in a simulation, transferring the final joint trajectory to the actual robot.Smart City applications involve working in highly dynamic and complex environments, where having a precise model is not always achievable.Our goal is to study the tractability of performing these evaluations directly in a real-world scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Two different approaches to reduce the number of evaluations using EA, are proposed and compared. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>In the first approach, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based methods have been studied and compared within CGDA: naive PSO, Fitness Inheritance PSO (FI-PSO), and Adaptive Fuzzy Fitness Granulation with PSO (AFFG-PSO).The second approach studied the introduction of geometrical and velocity constraints within CGDA.The effects of both approaches were analyzed and compared in the wax and paint actions, two CGDA commonly studied use cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results from this paper depict an important reduction in the number of evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video diffusion models has been gaining increasing attention for its ability to produce videos that are both coherent and of high fidelity.However, the iterative denoising process makes it computationally intensive and time-consuming, thus limiting its applications.Inspired by the Consistency Model (CM) that distills pretrained image diffusion models to accelerate the sampling with minimal steps and its successful extension Latent Consistency Model (LCM) on conditional image generation, we propose AnimateLCM, allowing for high-fidelity video generation within minimal steps.Instead of directly conducting consistency learning on the raw video dataset, we propose a decoupled consistency learning strategy that decouples the distillation of image generation priors and motion generation priors, which improves the training efficiency and enhance the generation visual quality.Additionally, to enable the combination of plug-and-play adapters in stable diffusion community to achieve various functions (e.g., ControlNet for controllable generation).we propose an efficient strategy to adapt existing adapters to our distilled text-conditioned video consistency model or train adapters from scratch without harming the sampling speed.We validate the proposed strategy in image-conditioned video generation and layout-conditioned video generation, all achieving top-performing results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>Code and weights will be made public.More details are available at https://github.com/G-U-N/AnimateLCM.</p>

                  <p>Feature attribution methods (FAs), such as gradients and attention, are widely employed approaches to derive the importance of all input features to the model predictions.Existing work in natural language processing has mostly focused on developing and testing FAs for encoder-only language models (LMs) in classification tasks.However, it is unknown if it is faithful to use these FAs for decoder-only models on text generation, due to the inherent differences between model architectures and task settings respectively.Moreover, previous work has demonstrated that there is no `one-wins-all' FA across models and tasks.This makes the selection of a FA computationally expensive for large LMs since input importance derivation often requires multiple forward and backward passes including gradient computations that might be prohibitive even with access to large compute.To address these issues, we present a model-agnostic FA for generative LMs called Recursive Attribution Generator (ReAGent).Our method updates the token importance distribution in a recursive manner.For each update, we compute the difference in the probability distribution over the vocabulary for predicting the next token between using the original input and using a modified version where a part of the input is replaced with RoBERTa predictions.Our intuition is that replacing an important token in the context should have resulted in a larger change in the model's confidence in predicting the token than replacing an unimportant token.Our method can be universally applied to any generative LM without accessing internal model weights or additional training and fine-tuning, as most other FAs require.We extensively compare the faithfulness of ReAGent with seven popular FAs across six decoder-only LMs of various sizes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that our method consistently provides more faithful token importance distributions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the crucial importance of addressing Black Hole failures in Internet backbone networks, effective detection strategies in backbone networks are lacking.This is largely because previous research has been centered on Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), which operate under entirely different dynamics, protocols, and topologies, making their findings not directly transferable to backbone networks.Furthermore, detecting Black Hole failures in backbone networks is particularly challenging.It requires a comprehensive range of network data due to the wide variety of conditions that need to be considered, making data collection and analysis far from straightforward.Addressing this gap, our study introduces a novel approach for Black Hole detection in backbone networks using specializedYet Another Next Generation (YANG) data models with Black Hole-sensitive Metric Matrix (BHMM) analysis.This paper details our method of selecting and analyzing four YANG models relevant to Black Hole detection in ISP networks, focusing on routing protocols and ISP-specific configurations.Our BHMM approach derived from these models demonstrates a 10% improvement in detection accuracy and a 13% increase in packet delivery rate, highlighting the efficiency of our approach.Additionally, we evaluate the Machine Learning approach leveraged with BHMM analysis in two different network settings, a commercial ISP network, and a scientific research-only network topology.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This evaluation also demonstrates the practical applicability of our method, yielding significantly improved prediction outcomes in both environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span></p>

                  <p>Differential privacy (DP) is increasingly used to protect the release of hierarchical, tabular population data, such as census data.A common approach for implementing DP in this setting is to release noisy responses to a predefined set of queries.For example, this is the approach of the TopDown algorithm used by the US Census Bureau.Such methods have an important shortcoming: they cannot answer queries for which they were not optimized.An appealing alternative is to generate DP synthetic data, which is drawn from some generating distribution.Like the TopDown method, synthetic data can also be optimized to answer specific queries, while also allowing the data user to later submit arbitrary queries over the synthetic population data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To our knowledge, there has not been a head-to-head empirical comparison of these approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>This study conducts such a comparison between the TopDown algorithm and private synthetic data generation to determine how accuracy is affected by query complexity, in-distribution vs. out-of-distribution queries, and privacy guarantees.Our results show that for in-distribution queries, the TopDown algorithm achieves significantly better privacy-fidelity tradeoffs than any of the synthetic data methods we evaluated; for instance, in our experiments, TopDown achieved at least $20\times$ lower error on counting queries than the leading synthetic data method at the same privacy budget.Our findings suggest guidelines for practitioners and the synthetic data research community.</p>

                  <p>The paper introduces the Decouple Re-identificatiOn and human Parsing (DROP) method for occluded person re-identification (ReID).Unlike mainstream approaches using global features for simultaneous multi-task learning of ReID and human parsing, or relying on semantic information for attention guidance, DROP argues that the inferior performance of the former is due to distinct granularity requirements for ReID and human parsing features.ReID focuses on instance part-level differences between pedestrian parts, while human parsing centers on semantic spatial context, reflecting the internal structure of the human body.To address this, DROP decouples features for ReID and human parsing, proposing detail-preserving upsampling to combine varying resolution feature maps.Parsing-specific features for human parsing are decoupled, and human position information is exclusively added to the human parsing branch.In the ReID branch, a part-aware compactness loss is introduced to enhance instance-level part differences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results highlight the efficacy of DROP, especially achieving a Rank-1 accuracy of 76.8% on Occluded-Duke, surpassing two mainstream methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>The codebase is accessible at https://github.com/shuguang-52/DROP.</p>

                  <p>End-to-end multi-task dialogue systems are usually designed with separate modules for the dialogue pipeline.Among these, the policy module is essential for deciding what to do in response to user input.This policy is trained by reinforcement learning algorithms by taking advantage of an environment in which an agent receives feedback in the form of a reward signal.The current dialogue systems, however, only provide meagre and simplistic rewards.Investigating intrinsic motivation reinforcement learning algorithms is the goal of this study.Through this, the agent can quickly accelerate training and improve its capacity to judge the quality of its actions by teaching it an internal incentive system.In particular, we adapt techniques for random network distillation and curiosity-driven reinforcement learning to measure the frequency of state visits and encourage exploration by using semantic similarity between utterances.Experimental results on MultiWOZ, a heterogeneous dataset, show that intrinsic motivation-based debate systems outperform policies that depend on extrinsic incentives.By adopting random network distillation, for example, which is trained using semantic similarity between user-system dialogues, an astounding average success rate of 73% is achieved.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is a significant improvement over the baseline Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which has an average success rate of 60%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, performance indicators such as booking rates and completion rates show a 10% rise over the baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Furthermore, these intrinsic incentive models help improve the system's policy's resilience in an increasing amount of domains.This implies that they could be useful in scaling up to settings that cover a wider range of domains.</p>

                  <p>Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation has recently garnered considerable attention, where fine-tuning plays a key role in LLMs' adaptation.However, the cost of fine-tuning LLMs on rapidly expanding recommendation data limits their practical application.To address this challenge, few-shot fine-tuning offers a promising approach to quickly adapt LLMs to new recommendation data.We propose the task of data pruning for efficient LLM-based recommendation, aimed at identifying representative samples tailored for LLMs' few-shot fine-tuning.While coreset selection is closely related to the proposed task, existing coreset selection methods often rely on suboptimal heuristic metrics or entail costly optimization on large-scale recommendation data.   To tackle these issues, we introduce two objectives for the data pruning task in the context of LLM-based recommendation: 1) high accuracy aims to identify the influential samples that can lead to high overall performance; and 2) high efficiency underlines the low costs of the data pruning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To pursue the two objectives, we propose a novel data pruning method based on two scores, i.e., influence score and effort score, to efficiently identify the influential samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Particularly, the influence score is introduced to accurately estimate the influence of sample removal on the overall performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>To achieve low costs of the data pruning process, we use a small-sized surrogate model to replace LLMs to obtain the influence score.Considering the potential gap between the surrogate model and LLMs, we further propose an effort score to prioritize some hard samples specifically for LLMs.Empirical results on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.In particular, the proposed method uses only 2% samples to surpass the full data fine-tuning, reducing time costs by 97%.</p>

                  <p>Point-based object localization (POL), which pursues high-performance object sensing under low-cost data annotation, has attracted increased attention.However, the point annotation mode inevitably introduces semantic variance due to the inconsistency of annotated points.Existing POL heavily rely on strict annotation rules, which are difficult to define and apply, to handle the problem.In this study, we propose coarse point refinement (CPR), which to our best knowledge is the first attempt to alleviate semantic variance from an algorithmic perspective.CPR reduces the semantic variance by selecting a semantic centre point in a neighbourhood region to replace the initial annotated point.Furthermore, We design a sampling region estimation module to dynamically compute a sampling region for each object and use a cascaded structure to achieve end-to-end optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further integrate a variance regularization into the structure to concentrate the predicted scores, yielding CPR++. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>We observe that CPR++ can obtain scale information and further reduce the semantic variance in a global region, thus guaranteeing high-performance object localization.Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets validate the effectiveness of both CPR and CPR++.We hope our work can inspire more research on designing algorithms rather than annotation rules to address the semantic variance problem in POL.The dataset and code will be public at github.com/ucas-vg/PointTinyBenchmark.</p>

                  <p>Although significant efforts have been dedicated to aligning large language models (LLMs), red-teaming reports suggest that these carefully aligned LLMs could still be jailbroken through adversarial prompts, tuning, or decoding.Upon examining the jailbreaking vulnerability of aligned LLMs, we observe that the decoding distributions of jailbroken and aligned models differ only in the initial generations.This observation motivates us to propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, where adversaries can utilize smaller unsafe/aligned LLMs (e.g., 7B) to guide jailbreaking against significantly larger aligned LLMs (e.g., 70B).To jailbreak, one only needs to additionally decode two smaller LLMs once, which involves minimal computation and latency compared to decoding the larger LLMs.The efficacy of this attack is demonstrated through experiments conducted on five models from three different organizations.Our study reveals a previously unnoticed yet efficient way of jailbreaking, exposing an urgent safety issue that needs to be considered when aligning LLMs.As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code for replicating the method is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique that aligns language models closely with human-centric values.The initial phase of RLHF involves learning human values using a reward model from ranking data.It is observed that the performance of the reward model degrades after one epoch of training, and optimizing too much against the learned reward model eventually hinders the true objective.This paper delves into these issues, leveraging the theoretical insights to design improved reward learning algorithm termed 'Iterative Data Smoothing' (IDS).The core idea is that during each training epoch, we not only update the model with the data, but also update the date using the model, replacing hard labels with soft labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical findings highlight the superior performance of this approach over the traditional methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are difficult to fully fine-tune (e.g., with instructions or human feedback) due to their sheer number of parameters.A family of parameter-efficient sparse fine-tuning (SFT) methods have proven promising in terms of performance but their memory requirements increase proportionally to the size of the LLMs.In this work, we scale sparse fine-tuning to state-of-the-art LLMs like LLaMA 2 7B and 13B. At any given time, for a desired density level, we maintain an array of parameter indices and the deltas of these parameters relative to their pretrained values.We iterate among: (a) updating the active deltas, (b) pruning indices (based on the change of magnitude of their deltas) and (c) regrowth of indices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For regrowth, we explore two criteria based on either the accumulated gradients of a few candidate parameters or their approximate momenta estimated using the efficient SM3 optimizer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>We experiment with instruction-tuning of LLMs on standard dataset mixtures, finding that SFT is often superior to popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA (low-rank adaptation) in terms of performance and comparable in terms of run time.We additionally show that SFT is compatible with both quantization and efficient optimizers, to facilitate scaling to ever-larger model sizes.We release the code for SFT at https://github.com/AlanAnsell/peft and for the instruction-tuning experiments at https://github.com/ducdauge/sft-llm.</p>

                  <p>Feature attribution methods (FAs), such as gradients and attention, are widely employed approaches to derive the importance of all input features to the model predictions.Existing work in natural language processing has mostly focused on developing and testing FAs for encoder-only language models (LMs) in classification tasks.However, it is unknown if it is faithful to use these FAs for decoder-only models on text generation, due to the inherent differences between model architectures and task settings respectively.Moreover, previous work has demonstrated that there is no `one-wins-all' FA across models and tasks.This makes the selection of a FA computationally expensive for large LMs since input importance derivation often requires multiple forward and backward passes including gradient computations that might be prohibitive even with access to large compute.To address these issues, we present a model-agnostic FA for generative LMs called Recursive Attribution Generator (ReAGent).Our method updates the token importance distribution in a recursive manner.For each update, we compute the difference in the probability distribution over the vocabulary for predicting the next token between using the original input and using a modified version where a part of the input is replaced with RoBERTa predictions.Our intuition is that replacing an important token in the context should have resulted in a larger change in the model's confidence in predicting the token than replacing an unimportant token.Our method can be universally applied to any generative LM without accessing internal model weights or additional training and fine-tuning, as most other FAs require.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We extensively compare the faithfulness of ReAGent with seven popular FAs across six decoder-only LMs of various sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>The results show that our method consistently provides more faithful token importance distributions.</p>
