For RQ1, we provided the 130 SO questions to ChatGPT, and manually compared ChatGPT answers with the accepted/most popular SO answers in terms of relevance, readability, informativeness, comprehensiveness, and reusability.For RQ2, we conducted a user study with 30 developers, asking each developer to assess and compare 10 pairs of answers, without knowing the information source (i.e., ChatGPT or SO).For RQ3, we distilled 48 software maintenance tasks from 48 GitHub projects citing the studied SO threads.We queried ChatGPT to revise a given Java file, and to incorporate the code implementation for any prescribed maintenance requirement.Our study reveals interesting phenomena: For the majority of SO questions (97/130), ChatGPT provided better answers; in 203 of 300 ratings, developers preferred ChatGPT answers to SO answers; ChatGPT revised code correctly for 22 of the 48 tasks.Our research will expand people's knowledge of ChatGPT capabilities, and shed light on future adoption of ChatGPT by the software industry.</p>

                  <p>Enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform tasks in zero-shot has been an appealing goal owing to its labor-saving (i.e., requiring no task-specific annotations); as such, zero-shot prompting approaches also enjoy better task generalizability.To improve LLMs' zero-shot performance, prior work has focused on devising more effective task instructions (e.g., ``let's think step by step'' ).However, we argue that, in order for an LLM to solve them correctly in zero-shot, individual test instances need more carefully designed and customized instructions.To this end, we propose PRoMPTd, an approach that rewrites the task prompt for each individual test input to be more specific, unambiguous, and complete, so as to provide better guidance to the task LLM.We evaluated PRoMPTd on eight datasets covering tasks including arithmetics, logical reasoning, and code generation, using GPT-4 as the task LLM.Notably, \algoname achieves an absolute improvement of around 10\% on the complex MATH dataset and 5\% on the code generation task on HumanEval, outperforming conventional zero-shot methods.In addition, we also showed that the rewritten prompt can provide better interpretability of how the LLM resolves each test instance, which can potentially be leveraged as a defense mechanism against adversarial prompting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and dataset can be obtained from https://github.com/salokr/PRoMPTd <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.892</span></span></p>

                  <p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit impressive skills in various domains, their ability for mathematical reasoning within visual contexts has not been formally examined.Equipping LLMs and LMMs with this capability is vital for general-purpose AI assistants and showcases promising potential in education, data analysis, and scientific discovery.To bridge this gap, we present MathVista, a benchmark designed to amalgamate challenges from diverse mathematical and visual tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first taxonomize the key task types, reasoning skills, and visual contexts from the literature to guide our selection from 28 existing math-focused and visual question answering datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>Then, we construct three new datasets, IQTest, FunctionQA, and PaperQA, to accommodate for missing types of visual contexts.The problems featured often require deep visual understanding beyond OCR or image captioning, and compositional reasoning with rich domain-specific tools, thus posing a notable challenge to existing models.We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 11 prominent open-source and proprietary foundation models (LLMs, LLMs augmented with tools, and LMMs), and early experiments with GPT-4V. The best-performing model, Multimodal Bard, achieves only 58% of human performance (34.8% vs 60.3%), indicating ample room for further improvement.Given this significant gap, MathVista fuels future research in the development of general-purpose AI agents capable of tackling mathematically intensive and visually rich real-world tasks.Preliminary tests show that MathVista also presents challenges to GPT-4V, underscoring the benchmark's importance.The project is available at https://mathvista.github.io/.</p>

                  <p>Existing methods for 3D tracking from monocular RGB videos predominantly consider articulated and rigid objects.Modelling dense non-rigid object deformations in this setting remained largely unaddressed so far, although such effects can improve the realism of the downstream applications such as AR/VR and avatar communications.This is due to the severe ill-posedness of the monocular view setting and the associated challenges.While it is possible to naively track multiple non-rigid objects independently using 3D templates or parametric 3D models, such an approach would suffer from multiple artefacts in the resulting 3D estimates such as depth ambiguity, unnatural intra-object collisions and missing or implausible deformations.Hence, this paper introduces the first method that addresses the fundamental challenges depicted above and that allows tracking human hands interacting with human faces in 3D from single monocular RGB videos.We model hands as articulated objects inducing non-rigid face deformations during an active interaction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method relies on a new hand-face motion and interaction capture dataset with realistic face deformations acquired with a markerless multi-view camera system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span>As a pivotal step in its creation, we process the reconstructed raw 3D shapes with position-based dynamics and an approach for non-uniform stiffness estimation of the head tissues, which results in plausible annotations of the surface deformations, hand-face contact regions and head-hand positions.At the core of our neural approach are a variational auto-encoder supplying the hand-face depth prior and modules that guide the 3D tracking by estimating the contacts and the deformations.Our final 3D hand and face reconstructions are realistic and more plausible compared to several baselines applicable in our setting, both quantitatively and qualitatively.https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/Decaf</p>

                  <p>Advancements in deep neural networks have allowed automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems to attain human parity on several publicly available clean speech datasets.However, even state-of-the-art ASR systems experience performance degradation when confronted with adverse conditions, as a well-trained acoustic model is sensitive to variations in the speech domain, e.g., background noise.Intuitively, humans address this issue by relying on their linguistic knowledge: the meaning of ambiguous spoken terms is usually inferred from contextual cues thereby reducing the dependency on the auditory system.Inspired by this observation, we introduce the first open-source benchmark to utilize external large language models (LLMs) for ASR error correction, where N-best decoding hypotheses provide informative elements for true transcription prediction.This approach is a paradigm shift from the traditional language model rescoring strategy that can only select one candidate hypothesis as the output transcription.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed benchmark contains a novel dataset, HyPoradise (HP), encompassing more than 334,000 pairs of N-best hypotheses and corresponding accurate transcriptions across prevalent speech domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>Given this dataset, we examine three types of error correction techniques based on LLMs with varying amounts of labeled hypotheses-transcription pairs, which gains a significant word error rate (WER) reduction.Experimental evidence demonstrates the proposed technique achieves a breakthrough by surpassing the upper bound of traditional re-ranking based methods.More surprisingly, LLM with reasonable prompt and its generative capability can even correct those tokens that are missing in N-best list.We make our results publicly accessible for reproducible pipelines with released pre-trained models, thus providing a new evaluation paradigm for ASR error correction with LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Purely medical cancer screening methods are often costly, time-consuming, and weakly applicable on a large scale.Advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods greatly help cancer detection but require specific or deep medical data.These aspects affect the mass implementation of cancer screening methods.For these reasons, it is a disruptive change for healthcare to apply AI methods for mass personalized assessment of the cancer risk among patients based on the existing Electronic Health Records (EHR) volume.   This paper presents a novel method for mass cancer risk prediction using EHR data.Among other methods, our one stands out by the minimum data greedy policy, requiring only a history of medical service codes and diagnoses from EHR.We formulate the problem as a binary classification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset contains 175 441 de-identified patients (2 861 diagnosed with cancer). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.886</span></span>As a baseline, we implement a solution based on a recurrent neural network (RNN).We propose a method that combines machine learning and survival analysis since these approaches are less computationally heavy, can be combined into an ensemble (the Survival Ensemble), and can be reproduced in most medical institutions.   We test the Survival Ensemble in some studies.Firstly, we obtain a significant difference between values of the primary metric (Average Precision) with 22.8% (ROC AUC 83.7%, F1 17.8%) for the Survival Ensemble versus 15.1% (ROC AUC 84.9%, F1 21.4%) for the Baseline.Secondly, the performance of the Survival Ensemble is also confirmed during the ablation study.Thirdly, our method exceeds age baselines by a significant margin.Fourthly, in the blind retrospective out-of-time experiment, the proposed method is reliable in cancer patient detection (9 out of 100 selected).Such results exceed the estimates of medical screenings, e.g., the best Number Needed to Screen (9 out of 1000 screenings).</p>

                  <p>Recently, the RGB images and point clouds fusion methods have been proposed to jointly estimate 2D optical flow and 3D scene flow.However, as both conventional RGB cameras and LiDAR sensors adopt a frame-based data acquisition mechanism, their performance is limited by the fixed low sampling rates, especially in highly-dynamic scenes.By contrast, the event camera can asynchronously capture the intensity changes with a very high temporal resolution, providing complementary dynamic information of the observed scenes.In this paper, we incorporate RGB images, Point clouds and Events for joint optical flow and scene flow estimation with our proposed multi-stage multimodal fusion model, RPEFlow.First, we present an attention fusion module with a cross-attention mechanism to implicitly explore the internal cross-modal correlation for 2D and 3D branches, respectively.Second, we introduce a mutual information regularization term to explicitly model the complementary information of three modalities for effective multimodal feature learning.We also contribute a new synthetic dataset to advocate further research.Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art by a wide margin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset is available at https://npucvr.github.io/RPEFlow. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.903</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the advances in robotics a large proportion of the of parts handling tasks in the automotive industry's internal logistics are not automated but still performed by humans.A key component to competitively automate these processes is a 6D pose estimation that can handle a large number of different parts, is adaptable to new parts with little manual effort, and is sufficiently accurate and robust with respect to industry requirements.In this context, the question arises as to the current status quo with respect to these measures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this we built a representative 6D pose estimation pipeline with state-of-the-art components from economically scalable real to synthetic data generation to pose estimators and evaluated it on automotive parts with regards to a realistic sequencing process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>We found that using the data generation approaches, the performance of the trained 6D pose estimators are promising, but do not meet industry requirements.We reveal that the reason for this is the inability of the estimators to provide reliable uncertainties for their poses, rather than the ability of to provide sufficiently accurate poses.In this context we further analyzed how RGB- and RGB-D-based approaches compare against this background and show that they are differently vulnerable to the domain gap induced by synthetic data.</p>

                  <p>While resources for English language are fairly sufficient to understand content on social media, similar resources in Arabic are still immature.The main reason that the resources in Arabic are insufficient is that Arabic has many dialects in addition to the standard version (MSA).Arabs do not use MSA in their daily communications; rather, they use dialectal versions.Unfortunately, social users transfer this phenomenon into their use of social media platforms, which in turn has raised an urgent need for building suitable AI models for language-dependent applications.Existing machine translation (MT) systems designed for MSA fail to work well with Arabic dialects.In light of this, it is necessary to adapt to the informal nature of communication on social networks by developing MT systems that can effectively handle the various dialects of Arabic.Unlike for MSA that shows advanced progress in MT systems, little effort has been exerted to utilize Arabic dialects for MT systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While few attempts have been made to build translation datasets for dialectal Arabic, they are domain dependent and are not OSN cultural-language friendly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>In this work, we attempt to alleviate these limitations by proposing an online social network-based multidialect Arabic dataset that is crafted by contextually translating English tweets into four Arabic dialects: Gulf, Yemeni, Iraqi, and Levantine.To perform the translation, we followed our proposed guideline framework for content translation, which could be universally applicable for translation between foreign languages and local dialects.We validated the authenticity of our proposed dataset by developing neural MT models for four Arabic dialects.Our results have shown a superior performance of our NMT models trained using our dataset.We believe that our dataset can reliably serve as an Arabic multidialectal translation dataset for informal MT tasks.</p>

                  <p>Grammatical Error Detection and Correction (GEC) tools have proven useful for native speakers and second language learners.Developing such tools requires a large amount of parallel, annotated data, which is unavailable for most languages.Synthetic data generation is a common practice to overcome the scarcity of such data.However, it is not straightforward for morphologically rich languages like Turkish due to complex writing rules that require phonological, morphological, and syntactic information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we present a flexible and extensible synthetic data generation pipeline for Turkish covering more than 20 expert-curated grammar and spelling rules (a.k.a., writing rules) implemented through complex transformation functions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>Using this pipeline, we derive 130,000 high-quality parallel sentences from professionally edited articles.Additionally, we create a more realistic test set by manually annotating a set of movie reviews.We implement three baselines formulating the task as i) neural machine translation, ii) sequence tagging, and iii) prefix tuning with a pretrained decoder-only model, achieving strong results.Furthermore, we perform exhaustive experiments on out-of-domain datasets to gain insights on the transferability and robustness of the proposed approaches.Our results suggest that our corpus, GECTurk, is high-quality and allows knowledge transfer for the out-of-domain setting.To encourage further research on Turkish GEC, we release our datasets, baseline models, and the synthetic data generation pipeline at https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/gecturk.</p>

                  <p>Online misinformation poses a global risk with significant real-world consequences.To combat misinformation, current research relies on professionals like journalists and fact-checkers for annotating and debunking misinformation, and develops automated machine learning methods for detecting misinformation.Complementary to these approaches, recent research has increasingly concentrated on utilizing the power of ordinary social media users, a.k.a. "crowd", who act as eyes-on-the-ground proactively questioning and countering misinformation.Notably, recent studies show that 96% of counter-misinformation responses originate from them.Acknowledging their prominent role, we present the first systematic and comprehensive survey of research papers that actively leverage the crowds to combat misinformation.   We first identify 88 papers related to crowd-based efforts, following a meticulous annotation process adhering to the PRISMA framework.We then present key statistics related to misinformation, counter-misinformation, and crowd input in different formats and topics.Upon holistic analysis of the papers, we introduce a novel taxonomy of the roles played by the crowds: (i)annotators who actively identify misinformation; (ii)evaluators who assess counter-misinformation effectiveness; (iii)creators who create counter-misinformation.This taxonomy explores the crowd's capabilities in misinformation detection, identifies prerequisites for effective counter-misinformation, and analyzes crowd-generated counter-misinformation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, we delve into (i)distinguishing individual, collaborative, and machine-assisted labeling for annotators; (ii)analyzing the effectiveness of counter-misinformation through surveys, interviews, and in-lab experiments for evaluators; and (iii)characterizing creation patterns and creator profiles for creators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Finally, we outline potential future research in this field.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive internet corpora that often contain copyrighted content.This poses legal and ethical challenges for the developers and users of these models, as well as the original authors and publishers.In this paper, we propose a novel technique for unlearning a subset of the training data from a LLM, without having to retrain it from scratch.   We evaluate our technique on the task of unlearning the Harry Potter books from the Llama2-7b model (a generative language model recently open-sourced by Meta).While the model took over 184K GPU-hours to pretrain, we show that in about 1 GPU hour of finetuning, we effectively erase the model's ability to generate or recall Harry Potter-related content, while its performance on common benchmarks (such as Winogrande, Hellaswag, arc, boolq and piqa) remains almost unaffected.We make our fine-tuned model publicly available on HuggingFace for community evaluation.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to present an effective technique for unlearning in generative language models.   Our technique consists of three main components:First, we use a reinforced model that is further trained on the target data to identify the tokens that are most related to the unlearning target, by comparing its logits with those of a baseline model.Second, we replace idiosyncratic expressions in the target data with generic counterparts, and leverage the model's own predictions to generate alternative labels for every token.These labels aim to approximate the next-token predictions of a model that has not been trained on the target data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Third, we finetune the model on these alternative labels, which effectively erases the original text from the model's memory whenever it is prompted with its context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Relevance labels, which indicate whether a search result is valuable to a searcher, are key to evaluating and optimising search systems.The best way to capture the true preferences of users is to ask them for their careful feedback on which results would be useful, but this approach does not scale to produce a large number of labels.Getting relevance labels at scale is usually done with third-party labellers, who judge on behalf of the user, but there is a risk of low-quality data if the labeller doesn't understand user needs.To improve quality, one standard approach is to study real users through interviews, user studies and direct feedback, find areas where labels are systematically disagreeing with users, then educate labellers about user needs through judging guidelines, training and monitoring.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces an alternate approach for improving label quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>It takes careful feedback from real users, which by definition is the highest-quality first-party gold data that can be derived, and develops an large language model prompt that agrees with that data.

                  <p>Modern code generation tools use AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to generate functional and complete code.While such tools are becoming popular and widely available for developers, using these tools is often accompanied by security challenges.Therefore, it is important to assess the quality of the generated code, especially in terms of its security.Researchers have recently explored various aspects of code generation tools, including security.However, many open questions about the security of the generated code require further investigation, especially the security issues of automatically generated code in the wild.To this end, we conducted an empirical study by analyzing the security weaknesses in code snippets generated by GitHub Copilot that are found as part of publicly available projects hosted on GitHub.The goal is to investigate the types of security issues and their scale in real-world scenarios (rather than crafted scenarios).To this end, we identified 435 code snippets generated by Copilot from publicly available projects.We then conducted extensive security analysis to identify Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) instances in these code snippets.The results show that (1) 35.8% of Copilot generated code snippets contain CWEs, and those issues are spread across multiple languages, (2) the security weaknesses are diverse and related to 42 different CWEs, in which CWE-78: OS Command Injection, CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values, and CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions occurred the most frequently, and (3) among the 42 CWEs identified, 11 of those belong to the currently recognized 2022 CWE Top-25.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings confirm that developers should be careful when adding code generated by Copilot (and similar AI code generation tools) and should also run appropriate security checks as they accept the suggested code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>
