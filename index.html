                  <p>We present PD-REAL, a novel large-scale dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) in the 3D domain.It is motivated by the fact that 2D-only representations in the AD task may fail to capture the geometric structures of anomalies due to uncertainty in lighting conditions or shooting angles.PD-REAL consists entirely of Play-Doh models for 15 object categories and focuses on the analysis of potential benefits from 3D information in a controlled environment.Specifically, objects are first created with six types of anomalies, such as dent, crack, or perforation, and then photographed under different lighting conditions to mimic real-world inspection scenarios.To demonstrate the usefulness of 3D information, we use a commercially available RealSense camera to capture RGB and depth images.Compared to the existing 3D dataset for AD tasks, the data acquisition of PD-REAL is significantly cheaper, easily scalable and easier to control variables.Extensive evaluations with state-of-the-art AD algorithms on our dataset demonstrate the benefits as well as challenges of using 3D information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset can be downloaded from https://github.com/Andy-cs008/PD-REAL <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.92</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, pretrained language models have shown state-of-the-art performance on the vulnerability detection task.These models are pretrained on a large corpus of source code, then fine-tuned on a smaller supervised vulnerability dataset.Due to the different training objectives and the performance of the models, it is interesting to consider whether the models have learned the semantics of code relevant to vulnerability detection, namely bug semantics, and if so, how the alignment to bug semantics relates to model performance.In this paper, we analyze the models using three distinct methods: interpretability tools, attention analysis, and interaction matrix analysis.We compare the models' influential feature sets with the bug semantic features which define the causes of bugs, including buggy paths and Potentially Vulnerable Statements (PVS).We find that (1) better-performing models also aligned better with PVS, (2) the models failed to align strongly to PVS, and (3) the models failed to align at all to buggy paths.Based on our analysis, we developed two annotation methods which highlight the bug semantics inside the model's inputs.We evaluated our approach on four distinct transformer models and four vulnerability datasets and found that our annotations improved the models' performance in the majority of settings - 11 out of 16, with up to 9.57 points improvement in F1 score compared to conventional fine-tuning.We further found that with our annotations, the models aligned up to 232% better to potentially vulnerable statements.Our findings indicate that it is helpful to provide the model with information of the bug semantics, that the model can attend to it, and motivate future work in learning more complex path-based bug semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at https://figshare.com/s/4a16a528d6874aad51a0. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurate reconstruction of plant phenotypes plays a key role in optimising sustainable farming practices in the field of Precision Agriculture (PA).Currently, optical sensor-based approaches dominate the field, but the need for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction of crops and plants in unstructured agricultural environments remains challenging.Recently, a promising development has emerged in the form of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), a novel method that utilises neural density fields.This technique has shown impressive performance in various novel vision synthesis tasks, but has remained relatively unexplored in the agricultural context.In our study, we focus on two fundamental tasks within plant phenotyping: (1) the synthesis of 2D novel-view images and (2) the 3D reconstruction of crop and plant models.We explore the world of neural radiance fields, in particular two SOTA methods: Instant-NGP, which excels in generating high-quality images with impressive training and inference speed, and Instant-NSR, which improves the reconstructed geometry by incorporating the Signed Distance Function (SDF) during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, we present a novel plant phenotype dataset comprising real plant images from production environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>This dataset is a first-of-its-kind initiative aimed at comprehensively exploring the advantages and limitations of NeRF in agricultural contexts.Our experimental results show that NeRF demonstrates commendable performance in the synthesis of novel-view images and is able to achieve reconstruction results that are competitive with Reality Capture, a leading commercial software for 3D Multi-View Stereo (MVS)-based reconstruction.However, our study also highlights certain drawbacks of NeRF, including relatively slow training speeds, performance limitations in cases of insufficient sampling, and challenges in obtaining geometry quality in complex setups.</p>

                  <p>In natural language processing (NLP), lexical function is a concept to unambiguously represent semantic and syntactic features of words and phrases in text first crafted in the Meaning-Text Theory.Hierarchical classification of lexical functions involves organizing these features into a tree-like hierarchy of categories or labels.This is a challenging task as it requires a good understanding of the context and the relationships among words and phrases in text.It also needs large amounts of labeled data to train language models effectively.In this paper, we present a dataset of most frequent Spanish verb-noun collocations and sentences where they occur, each collocation is assigned to one of 37 lexical functions defined as classes for a hierarchical classification task.Each class represents a relation between the noun and the verb in a collocation involving their semantic and syntactic features.We combine the classes in a tree-based structure, and introduce classification objectives for each level of the structure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset was created by dependency tree parsing and matching of the phrases in Spanish news. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.795</span></span>We provide baselines and data splits for each objective.</p>

                  <p>Personal sensing, leveraging data passively and near-continuously collected with wearables from patients in their ecological environment, is a promising paradigm to monitor mood disorders (MDs), a major determinant of worldwide disease burden.However, collecting and annotating wearable data is very resource-intensive.Studies of this kind can thus typically afford to recruit only a couple dozens of patients.This constitutes one of the major obstacles to applying modern supervised machine learning techniques to MDs detection.In this paper, we overcome this data bottleneck and advance the detection of MDs acute episode vs stable state from wearables data on the back of recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL).This leverages unlabelled data to learn representations during pre-training, subsequently exploited for a supervised task.First, we collected open-access datasets recording with an Empatica E4 spanning different, unrelated to MD monitoring, personal sensing tasks -- from emotion recognition in Super Mario players to stress detection in undergraduates -- and devised a pre-processing pipeline performing on-/off-body detection, sleep-wake detection, segmentation, and (optionally) feature extraction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With 161 E4-recorded subjects, we introduce E4SelfLearning, the largest to date open access collection, and its pre-processing pipeline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>Second, we show that SSL confidently outperforms fully-supervised pipelines using either our novel E4-tailored Transformer architecture (E4mer) or classical baseline XGBoost: 81.23% against 75.35% (E4mer) and 72.02% (XGBoost) correctly classified recording segments from 64 (half acute, half stable) patients.Lastly, we illustrate that SSL performance is strongly associated with the specific surrogate task employed for pre-training as well as with unlabelled data availability.</p>

                  <p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models to the vision domain.Initial efforts towards LMMs used holistic images and text prompts to generate ungrounded textual responses.Very recently, region-level LMMs have been used to generate visually grounded responses.However, they are limited to only referring a single object category at a time, require users to specify the regions in inputs, or cannot offer dense pixel-wise object grounding.In this work, we present Grounding LMM (GLaMM), the first model that can generate natural language responses seamlessly intertwined with corresponding object segmentation masks.GLaMM not only grounds objects appearing in the conversations but is flexible enough to accept both textual and optional visual prompts (region of interest) as input.This empowers users to interact with the model at various levels of granularity, both in textual and visual domains.Due to the lack of standard benchmarks for the novel setting of generating visually grounded detailed conversations, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol with our curated grounded conversations.Our proposed Grounded Conversation Generation (GCG) task requires densely grounded concepts in natural scenes at a large-scale.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we propose a densely annotated Grounding-anything Dataset (GranD) using our proposed automated annotation pipeline that encompasses 7.5M unique concepts grounded in a total of 810M regions available with segmentation masks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>Besides GCG, GLaMM also performs effectively on several downstream tasks e.g., referring expression segmentation, image and region-level captioning and vision-language conversations.Project Page: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/groundingLMM.</p>

                  <p>Human-robot walking with prosthetic legs and exoskeletons, especially over complex terrains such as stairs, remains a significant challenge.Egocentric vision has the unique potential to detect the walking environment prior to physical interactions, which can improve transitions to and from stairs.This motivated us to create the StairNet initiative to support the development of new deep learning models for visual sensing and recognition of stairs, with an emphasis on lightweight and efficient neural networks for onboard real-time inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we present an overview of the development of our large-scale dataset with over 515,000 manually labeled images, as well as our development of different deep learning models (e.g., 2D and 3D CNN, hybrid CNN and LSTM, and ViT networks) and training methods (e.g., supervised learning with temporal data and semi-supervised learning with unlabeled images) using our new dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>We consistently achieved high classification accuracy (i.e., up to 98.8%) with different designs, offering trade-offs between model accuracy and size.When deployed on mobile devices with GPU and NPU accelerators, our deep learning models achieved inference speeds up to 2.8 ms.We also deployed our models on custom-designed CPU-powered smart glasses.However, limitations in the embedded hardware yielded slower inference speeds of 1.5 seconds, presenting a trade-off between human-centered design and performance.Overall, we showed that StairNet can be an effective platform to develop and study new visual perception systems for human-robot locomotion with applications in exoskeleton and prosthetic leg control.</p>

                  <p>Data contamination in language model evaluation is increasingly prevalent as the popularity of large language models.It allows models to "cheat" via memorisation instead of displaying true capabilities.Therefore, contamination analysis has became an crucial part of reliable model evaluation to validate results.However, existing contamination analysis is usually conducted internally by LLM developers and often lacks transparency and completeness.This paper present an open source data contamination reports for the Llama series models.We analyse six popular multi-choice QA benchmarks and quantify their overlapping with the training set of Llama.Various levels of contamination ranging from 1\% to 8.7\% are found across benchmarks.Our comparison also reveals that Llama models can gain over 5\% higher accuracy on contaminated subsets versus clean subsets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data and code are available at: https://github.com/liyucheng09/Contamination_Detector. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurate measurement of the offset from roof-to-footprint in very-high-resolution remote sensing imagery is crucial for urban information extraction tasks.With the help of deep learning, existing methods typically rely on two-stage CNN models to extract regions of interest on building feature maps.At the first stage, a Region Proposal Network (RPN) is applied to extract thousands of ROIs (Region of Interests) which will post-imported into a Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) to extract wanted information.However, because of inflexible RPN, these methods often lack effective user interaction, encounter difficulties in instance correspondence, and struggle to keep up with the advancements in general artificial intelligence.This paper introduces an interactive Transformer model combined with a prompt encoder to precisely extract building segmentation as well as the offset vectors from roofs to footprints.In our model, a powerful module, namely ROAM, was tailored for common problems in predicting roof-to-footprint offsets.We tested our model's feasibility on the publicly available BONAI dataset, achieving a significant reduction in Prompt-Instance-Level offset errors ranging from 14.6% to 16.3%.Additionally, we developed a Distance-NMS algorithm tailored for large-scale building offsets, significantly enhancing the accuracy of predicted building offset angles and lengths in a straightforward and efficient manner.To further validate the model's robustness, we created a new test set using 0.5m remote sensing imagery from Huizhou, China, for inference testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, training methods, and the updated dataset will be accessable at https://github.com/likaiucas. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.853</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, pretrained language models have shown state-of-the-art performance on the vulnerability detection task.These models are pretrained on a large corpus of source code, then fine-tuned on a smaller supervised vulnerability dataset.Due to the different training objectives and the performance of the models, it is interesting to consider whether the models have learned the semantics of code relevant to vulnerability detection, namely bug semantics, and if so, how the alignment to bug semantics relates to model performance.In this paper, we analyze the models using three distinct methods: interpretability tools, attention analysis, and interaction matrix analysis.We compare the models' influential feature sets with the bug semantic features which define the causes of bugs, including buggy paths and Potentially Vulnerable Statements (PVS).We find that (1) better-performing models also aligned better with PVS, (2) the models failed to align strongly to PVS, and (3) the models failed to align at all to buggy paths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on our analysis, we developed two annotation methods which highlight the bug semantics inside the model's inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>We evaluated our approach on four distinct transformer models and four vulnerability datasets and found that our annotations improved the models' performance in the majority of settings - 11 out of 16, with up to 9.57 points improvement in F1 score compared to conventional fine-tuning.We further found that with our annotations, the models aligned up to 232% better to potentially vulnerable statements.Our findings indicate that it is helpful to provide the model with information of the bug semantics, that the model can attend to it, and motivate future work in learning more complex path-based bug semantics.Our code and data are available at https://figshare.com/s/4a16a528d6874aad51a0.</p>

                  <p>We study Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) enriched with the so-called Ramsey quantifiers, which assert the existence of cliques (complete graphs) in the graph induced by some formulas.The extended framework is known to have applications in proving program termination (in particular, whether a transitive binary predicate is well-founded), and monadic decomposability of SMT formulas.Our main result is a new algorithm for eliminating Ramsey quantifiers from three common SMT theories: Linear Integer Arithmetic (LIA), Linear Real Arithmetic (LRA), and Linear Integer Real Arithmetic (LIRA).In particular, if we work only with existentially quantified formulas, then our algorithm runs in polynomial time and produces a formula of linear size.One immediate consequence is that checking well-foundedness of a given formula in the aforementioned theory defining a transitive predicate can be straightforwardly handled by highly optimized SMT-solvers.We show also how this provides a uniform semi-algorithm for verifying termination and liveness with completeness guarantee (in fact, with an optimal computational complexity) for several well-known classes of infinite-state systems, which include succinct timed systems, one-counter systems, and monotonic counter systems.Another immediate consequence is a solution to an open problem on checking monadic decomposability of a given relation in quantifier-free fragments of LRA and LIRA, which is an important problem in automated reasoning and constraint databases.Our result immediately implies decidability of this problem with an optimal complexity (coNP-complete) and enables exploitation of SMT-solvers.It also provides a termination guarantee for the generic monadic decomposition algorithm of Veanes et al.for LIA, LRA, and LIRA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We report encouraging experimental results on a prototype implementation of our algorithms on micro-benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span></p>

                  <p>Alignment with human preference is a desired property of large language models (LLMs).Currently, the main alignment approach is based on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).Despite the effectiveness of RLHF, it is intricate to implement and train, thus recent studies explore how to develop alternative alignment approaches based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT).A major limitation of SFT is that it essentially does imitation learning, which cannot fully understand what are the expected behaviors.To address this issue, we propose an improved alignment approach named FIGA.Different from prior methods, we incorporate fine-grained (i.e., token or phrase level) quality signals that are derived by contrasting good and bad responses.Our approach has made two major contributions.Firstly, we curate a refined alignment dataset that pairs initial responses and the corresponding revised ones.Secondly, we devise a new loss function can leverage fine-grained quality signals to instruct the learning of LLMs for alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approaches by comparing a number of competitive baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span></p>

The idea of our augmenting path algorithm is based on a recent result by Kitamura and Izumi[IEICE Trans.'22], which efficiently identifies a sparse substructure of the input graph containing an augmenting path, following a new concept called \emph{alternating base trees}.Their algorithm, however, resorts to a centralized approach of collecting the entire information of the substructure into a single vertex for constructing an augmenting path.The technical highlight of this paper is to provide a fully-decentralized counterpart of such a centralized method.To develop the algorithm, we prove several new structural properties of alternating base trees, which are of independent interest.</p>

Our algorithm builds upon previous dynamic algorithms for approximately solving the minimum-ratio cycle problem that underlie previous advances on the maximum flow problem [Chen-Kyng-Liu-Peng-Probst Gutenberg-Sachdeva, FOCS '22] as well as recent dynamic maximum flow algorithms[v.d.Brand-Liu-Sidford, STOC '23].<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead of using interior point methods, which were a key component of these recent advances, our algorithm uses an optimization method based on $\ell_p$-norm iterative refinement and the multiplicative weight update method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>This ensures a monotonicity property in the minimum-ratio cycle subproblems that allows us to apply known data structures and bypass issues arising from adaptive queries.</p>

                  <p>In Physical Human--Robot Interaction (pHRI) grippers, humans and robots may contribute simultaneously to actions, so it is necessary to determine how to combine their commands.Control may be swapped from one to the other within certain limits, or input commands may be combined according to some criteria.The Assist-As-Needed (AAN) paradigm focuses on this second approach, as the controller is expected to provide the minimum required assistance to users.Some AAN systems rely on predicting human intention to adjust actions.However, if prediction is too hard, reactive AAN systems may weigh input commands into an emergent one.This paper proposes a novel AAN reactive control system for a robot gripper where input commands are weighted by their respective local performances.Thus, rather than minimizing tracking errors or differences to expected velocities, humans receive more help depending on their needs.The system has been tested using a gripper attached to a sensitive robot arm, which provides evaluation parameters.Tests consisted of completing an on-air planar path with both arms.After the robot gripped a person's forearm, the path and current position of the robot were displayed on a screen to provide feedback to the human.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed control has been compared to results without assistance and to impedance control for benchmarking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>A statistical analysis of the results proves that global performance improved and tracking errors decreased for ten volunteers with the proposed controller.Besides, unlike impedance control, the proposed one does not significantly affect exerted forces, command variation, or disagreement, measured as the angular difference between human and output command.Results support that the proposed control scheme fits the AAN paradigm, although future work will require further tests for more complex environments and tasks.</p>

                  <p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have recently shown impressive capability in modeling heterogeneous graphs that are ubiquitous in real-world applications.Due to the diversity of attributes of nodes in different types, most existing models first align nodes by mapping them into the same low-dimensional space.However, in this way, they lose the type information of nodes.In addition, most of them only consider the interactions between nodes while neglecting the high-order information behind the latent interactions among different node features.To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph model MULAN, including two major components, i.e., a type-aware encoder and a dimension-aware encoder.Specifically, the type-aware encoder compensates for the loss of node type information and better leverages graph heterogeneity in learning node representations.Built upon transformer architecture, the dimension-aware encoder is capable of capturing the latent interactions among the diverse node features.With these components, the information of graph heterogeneity, node features and graph structure can be comprehensively encoded in node representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on six heterogeneous benchmark datasets, which demonstrates the superiority of MULAN over other state-of-the-art competitors and also shows that MULAN is efficient. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we highlight a problem of evaluation metrics adopted in the open-vocabulary segmentation.That is, the evaluation process still heavily relies on closed-set metrics on zero-shot or cross-dataset pipelines without considering the similarity between predicted and ground truth categories.To tackle this issue, we first survey eleven similarity measurements between two categorical words using WordNet linguistics statistics, text embedding, and language models by comprehensive quantitative analysis and user study.Built upon those explored measurements, we designed novel evaluation metrics, namely Open mIoU, Open AP, and Open PQ, tailored for three open-vocabulary segmentation tasks.We benchmarked the proposed evaluation metrics on 12 open-vocabulary methods of three segmentation tasks.Even though the relative subjectivity of similarity distance, we demonstrate that our metrics can still well evaluate the open ability of the existing open-vocabulary segmentation methods.We hope that our work can bring with the community new thinking about how to evaluate the open ability of models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation code is released in github. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span></p>

                  <p>Intelligent structural design using AI can effectively reduce time overhead and increase efficiency.It has potential to become the new design paradigm in the future to assist and even replace engineers, and so it has become a research hotspot in the academic community.However, current methods have some limitations to be addressed, whether in terms of application scope, visual quality of generated results, or evaluation metrics of results.This study proposes a comprehensive solution.Firstly, we introduce building information modeling (BIM) into intelligent structural design and establishes a structural design pipeline integrating BIM and generative AI, which is a powerful supplement to the previous frameworks that only considered CAD drawings.In order to improve the perceptual quality and details of generations, this study makes 3 contributions.Firstly, in terms of generation framework, inspired by the process of human drawing, a novel 2-stage generation framework is proposed to replace the traditional end-to-end framework to reduce the generation difficulty for AI models.Secondly, in terms of generative AI tools adopted, diffusion models (DMs) are introduced to replace widely used generative adversarial network (GAN)-based models, and a novel physics-based conditional diffusion model (PCDM) is proposed to consider different design prerequisites.Thirdly, in terms of neural networks, an attention block (AB) consisting of a self-attention block (SAB) and a parallel cross-attention block (PCAB) is designed to facilitate cross-domain data fusion.The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the powerful generation and representation capabilities of PCDM.Necessary ablation studies are conducted to examine the validity of the methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study also shows that DMs have the potential to replace GANs and become the new benchmark for generative problems in civil engineering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span></p>

                  <p>WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format designed for secure and efficient execution within sandboxed environments - predominantly web apps and browsers - to facilitate performance, security, and flexibility of web programming languages.In recent years, Wasm has gained significant attention from academic research community and industrial development projects to engineer high-performance web applications.Despite the offered benefits, developers encounter a multitude of issues rooted in Wasm (e.g., faults, errors, failures) and are often unaware of their root-causes that impact the development of web applications.Wasm developers require knowledge, documented as empirically rooted guidelines, patterns, documents etc., that help them to understand, analyse, and resolve the issues that currently lacks in existing research and practice.To this end, we conducted an empirical study that mines and documents practitioners' knowledge expressed as 385 issues from 12 open-source Wasm projects deployed on GitHub and 354 question-answer posts via Stack Overflow.Our study led to the first-of-its-kind taxonomies of issues faced by developers and their underlying causes in Wasm-based applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Issues faced by developers arise from 'Infrastructure, Integration and Compatibility Aspects' (28.16%), 'Language Features and Documentation Errors' (18.00%), along with 'Code Implementation and Build failures' (13.83%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>The results indicate that 'Syntactic and Semantic Errors' (25.77%), 'Configuration and Compatibility Constraints' (20.1%), and 'Operational Limitations' (12.98%) are the principal causes of these issues.The study provides a taxonomical classification of issues and their causes, offering empirically derived guidelines, that can inform researchers and developers to systematically design, develop, and refactor Wasm-based applications.</p>

This paper proposes an automatic approach using the BART algorithm, a state-of-the-art transformer model, to generate summaries for APIs discussed in StackOverflow.We built an oracle of human-generated summaries to evaluate our approach against it using ROUGE and BLEU metrics which are the most widely used evaluation metrics in text summarization.Furthermore, we evaluated our summaries empirically against a previous work in terms of quality.Our findings demonstrate that using deep learning algorithms can improve summaries' quality and outperform the previous work by an average of %57 for Precision, %66 for Recall, and %61 for F-measure, and it runs 4.4 times faster.</p>
