                  <p>Learning and predicting the performance of given software configurations are of high importance to many software engineering activities.While configurable software systems will almost certainly face diverse running environments (e.g., version, hardware, and workload), current work often either builds performance models under a single environment or fails to properly handle data from diverse settings, hence restricting their accuracy for new environments.In this paper, we target configuration performance learning under multiple environments.We do so by designing SeMPL - a meta-learning framework that learns the common understanding from configurations measured in distinct (meta) environments and generalizes them to the unforeseen, target environment.What makes it unique is that unlike common meta-learning frameworks (e.g., MAML and MetaSGD) that train the meta environments in parallel, we train them sequentially, one at a time.The order of training naturally allows discriminating the contributions among meta environments in the meta-model built, which fits better with the characteristic of configuration data that is known to dramatically differ between different environments.Through comparing with 15 state-of-the-art models under nine systems, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that SeMPL performs considerably better on 89% of the systems with up to 99% accuracy improvement, while being data-efficient, leading to a maximum of 3.86x speedup.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and data can be found at our repository: https://github.com/ideas-labo/SeMPL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents a follow-up study to OpenAI's recent superalignment work on Weak-to-Strong Generalization (W2SG).Superalignment focuses on ensuring that high-level AI systems remain consistent with human values and intentions when dealing with complex, high-risk tasks.The W2SG framework has opened new possibilities for empirical research in this evolving field.Our study simulates two phases of superalignment under the W2SG framework: the development of general superhuman models and the progression towards superintelligence.In the first phase, based on human supervision, the quality of weak supervision is enhanced through a combination of scalable oversight and ensemble learning, reducing the capability gap between weak teachers and strong students.In the second phase, an automatic alignment evaluator is employed as the weak supervisor.By recursively updating this auto aligner, the capabilities of the weak teacher models are synchronously enhanced, achieving weak-to-strong supervision over stronger student models.We also provide an initial validation of the proposed approach for the first phase.Using the SciQ task as example, we explore ensemble learning for weak teacher models through bagging and boosting.Scalable oversight is explored through two auxiliary settings: human-AI interaction and AI-AI debate.Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of improved weak supervision on enhancing weak-to-strong generalization based on in-context learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiment code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/W2SG. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurate prediction of climate in the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale is crucial for disaster readiness, reduced economic risk, and improved policy-making amidst climate change.Yet, S2S prediction remains challenging due to the chaotic nature of the system.At present, existing benchmarks for weather and climate applications, tend to (1) have shorter forecasting range of up-to 14 days, (2) do not include a wide range of operational baseline forecasts, and (3) lack physics-based constraints for explainability.Thus, we propose ChaosBench, a large-scale, multi-channel, physics-based benchmark for S2S prediction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ChaosBench has over 460K frames of real-world observations and simulations, each with 60 variable-channels and spanning for up-to 45 years. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>We also propose several physics-based, in addition to vision-based metrics, that enables for a more physically-consistent model.Furthermore, we include a diverse set of physics-based forecasts from 4 national weather agencies as baselines to our data-driven counterpart.We establish two tasks that vary in complexity: full and sparse dynamics prediction.Our benchmark is one of the first to perform large-scale evaluation on existing models including PanguWeather, FourCastNetV2, GraphCast, and ClimaX, and finds methods originally developed for weather-scale applications fails on S2S task.We release our benchmark code and datasets at https://leap-stc.github.io/ChaosBench.</p>

                  <p>Point-based object localization (POL), which pursues high-performance object sensing under low-cost data annotation, has attracted increased attention.However, the point annotation mode inevitably introduces semantic variance due to the inconsistency of annotated points.Existing POL heavily rely on strict annotation rules, which are difficult to define and apply, to handle the problem.In this study, we propose coarse point refinement (CPR), which to our best knowledge is the first attempt to alleviate semantic variance from an algorithmic perspective.CPR reduces the semantic variance by selecting a semantic centre point in a neighbourhood region to replace the initial annotated point.Furthermore, We design a sampling region estimation module to dynamically compute a sampling region for each object and use a cascaded structure to achieve end-to-end optimization.We further integrate a variance regularization into the structure to concentrate the predicted scores, yielding CPR++.We observe that CPR++ can obtain scale information and further reduce the semantic variance in a global region, thus guaranteeing high-performance object localization.Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets validate the effectiveness of both CPR and CPR++.We hope our work can inspire more research on designing algorithms rather than annotation rules to address the semantic variance problem in POL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code will be public at github.com/ucas-vg/PointTinyBenchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modern plankton high-throughput monitoring relies on deep learning classifiers for species recognition in water ecosystems.Despite satisfactory nominal performances, a significant challenge arises from Dataset Shift, which causes performances to drop during deployment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our study, we integrate the ZooLake dataset with manually-annotated images from 10 independent days of deployment, serving as test cells to benchmark Out-Of-Dataset (OOD) performances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span>Our analysis reveals instances where classifiers, initially performing well in In-Dataset conditions, encounter notable failures in practical scenarios.For example, a MobileNet with a 92% nominal test accuracy shows a 77% OOD accuracy.We systematically investigate conditions leading to OOD performance drops and propose a preemptive assessment method to identify potential pitfalls when classifying new data, and pinpoint features in OOD images that adversely impact classification.We present a three-step pipeline: (i) identifying OOD degradation compared to nominal test performance, (ii) conducting a diagnostic analysis of degradation causes, and (iii) providing solutions.We find that ensembles of BEiT vision transformers, with targeted augmentations addressing OOD robustness, geometric ensembling, and rotation-based test-time augmentation, constitute the most robust model, which we call BEsT model.It achieves an 83% OOD accuracy, with errors concentrated on container classes.Moreover, it exhibits lower sensitivity to dataset shift, and reproduces well the plankton abundances.Our proposed pipeline is applicable to generic plankton classifiers, contingent on the availability of suitable test cells.By identifying critical shortcomings and offering practical procedures to fortify models against dataset shift, our study contributes to the development of more reliable plankton classification technologies.</p>

                  <p>Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (DocRTE) is a fundamental task in information systems that aims to simultaneously extract entities with semantic relations from a document.Existing methods heavily rely on a substantial amount of fully labeled data.However, collecting and annotating data for newly emerging relations is time-consuming and labor-intensive.Recent advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, exhibit impressive long-text generation capabilities, inspiring us to explore an alternative approach for obtaining auto-labeled documents with new relations.In this paper, we propose a Zero-shot Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (ZeroDocRTE) framework, which generates labeled data by retrieval and denoising knowledge from LLMs, called GenRDK.Specifically, we propose a chain-of-retrieval prompt to guide ChatGPT to generate labeled long-text data step by step.To improve the quality of synthetic data, we propose a denoising strategy based on the consistency of cross-document knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging our denoised synthetic data, we proceed to fine-tune the LLaMA2-13B-Chat for extracting document-level relation triplets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>We perform experiments for both zero-shot document-level relation and triplet extraction on two public datasets.The experimental results illustrate that our GenRDK framework outperforms strong baselines.</p>

                  <p>As the scale of vision models continues to grow, the emergence of Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) as a parameter-efficient transfer learning technique has gained attention due to its superior performance compared to traditional full-finetuning.However, the conditions favoring VPT (the ``when") and the underlying rationale (the ``why") remain unclear.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis across 19 distinct datasets and tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.853</span></span>To understand the ``when" aspect, we identify the scenarios where VPT proves favorable by two dimensions: task objectives and data distributions.We find that VPT is preferrable when there is 1) a substantial disparity between the original and the downstream task objectives (e.g., transitioning from classification to counting), or 2) a similarity in data distributions between the two tasks (e.g., both involve natural images).In exploring the ``why" dimension, our results indicate VPT's success cannot be attributed solely to overfitting and optimization considerations.The unique way VPT preserves original features and adds parameters appears to be a pivotal factor.Our study provides insights into VPT's mechanisms, and offers guidance for its optimal utilization.</p>

                  <p>VLMs (Vision-Language Models) extend the capabilities of LLMs (Large Language Models) to accept multimodal inputs.Since it has been verified that LLMs can be induced to generate harmful or inaccurate content through specific test cases (termed as Red Teaming), how VLMs perform in similar scenarios, especially with their combination of textual and visual inputs, remains a question.To explore this problem, we present a novel red teaming dataset RTVLM, which encompasses 10 subtasks (e.g., image misleading, multi-modal jail-breaking, face fairness, etc) under 4 primary aspects (faithfulness, privacy, safety, fairness).Our RTVLM is the first red-teaming dataset to benchmark current VLMs in terms of these 4 different aspects.Detailed analysis shows that 10 prominent open-sourced VLMs struggle with the red teaming in different degrees and have up to 31% performance gap with GPT-4V. Additionally, we simply apply red teaming alignment to LLaVA-v1.5 with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) using RTVLM, and this bolsters the models' performance with 10% in RTVLM test set, 13% in MM-Hal, and without noticeable decline in MM-Bench, overpassing other LLaVA-based models with regular alignment data.This reveals that current open-sourced VLMs still lack red teaming alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets will be open-source. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Pain assessment in individuals with neurological conditions, especially those with limited self-report ability and altered facial expressions, presents challenges.Existing measures, relying on direct observation by caregivers, lack sensitivity and specificity.In cerebral palsy, pain is a common comorbidity and a reliable evaluation protocol is crucial.Thus, having an automatic system that recognizes facial expressions could be of enormous help when diagnosing pain in this type of patient.   Objectives: 1) to build a dataset of facial pain expressions in individuals with cerebral palsy, and 2) to develop an automated facial recognition system based on deep learning for pain assessment addressed to this population.   Methods: Ten neural networks were trained on three pain image databases, including the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database, the Multimodal Intensity Pain Dataset, and the Delaware Pain Database.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, a curated dataset (CPPAIN) was created, consisting of 109 preprocessed facial pain expression images from individuals with cerebral palsy, categorized by two physiotherapists using the Facial Action Coding System observational scale.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>Results: InceptionV3 exhibited promising performance on the CP-PAIN dataset, achieving an accuracy of 62.67% and an F1 score of 61.12%.Explainable artificial intelligence techniques revealed consistent essential features for pain identification across models.   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models for robust pain detection in populations with neurological conditions and communication disabilities.The creation of a larger dataset specific to cerebral palsy would further enhance model accuracy, offering a valuable tool for discerning subtle and idiosyncratic pain expressions.The insights gained could extend to other complex neurological conditions.</p>

This process was guided by our ontology and involved a thorough automatic and manual filtering process, yielding a set of 216 maths problems.We conducted comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs on MORE.The results show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions.This strongly suggests that current LLMs lack robust mathematical skills and deep reasoning abilities.This research not only identifies multiple gaps in the capabilities of current models, but also highlights multiple potential directions for future development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset will be made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/GSM8k_MORE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span></p>

                  <p>While Bengali is considered a language with limited resources, sentiment analysis has been a subject of extensive research in the literature.Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of exploration into sentiment analysis specifically in the realm of noisy Bengali texts.In this paper, we introduce a dataset (NC-SentNoB) that we annotated manually to identify ten different types of noise found in a pre-existing sentiment analysis dataset comprising of around 15K noisy Bengali texts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>At first, given an input noisy text, we identify the noise type, addressing this as a multi-label classification task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>Then, we introduce baseline noise reduction methods to alleviate noise prior to conducting sentiment analysis.Finally, we assess the performance of fine-tuned sentiment analysis models with both noisy and noise-reduced texts to make comparisons.The experimental findings indicate that the noise reduction methods utilized are not satisfactory, highlighting the need for more suitable noise reduction methods in future research endeavors.We have made the implementation and dataset presented in this paper publicly available at https://github.com/ktoufiquee/A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Noise-Reduction-Methods-in-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Noisy-Bengali-Texts</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning is challenging in delayed scenarios, a common real-world situation where observations and interactions occur with delays.State-of-the-art (SOTA) state-augmentation techniques either suffer from the state-space explosion along with the delayed steps, or performance degeneration in stochastic environments.To address these challenges, our novel Auxiliary-Delayed Reinforcement Learning (AD-RL) leverages an auxiliary short-delayed task to accelerate the learning on a long-delayed task without compromising the performance in stochastic environments.Specifically, AD-RL learns the value function in the short-delayed task and then employs it with the bootstrapping and policy improvement techniques in the long-delayed task.We theoretically show that this can greatly reduce the sample complexity compared to directly learning on the original long-delayed task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On deterministic and stochastic benchmarks, our method remarkably outperforms the SOTAs in both sample efficiency and policy performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>In model-based reinforcement learning, most algorithms rely on simulating trajectories from one-step models of the dynamics learned on data.A critical challenge of this approach is the compounding of one-step prediction errors as the length of the trajectory grows.In this paper we tackle this issue by using a multi-step objective to train one-step models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our objective is a weighted sum of the mean squared error (MSE) loss at various future horizons. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>We find that this new loss is particularly useful when the data is noisy (additive Gaussian noise in the observations), which is often the case in real-life environments.To support the multi-step loss, first we study its properties in two tractable cases: i) uni-dimensional linear system, and ii) two-parameter non-linear system.Second, we show in a variety of tasks (environments or datasets) that the models learned with this loss achieve a significant improvement in terms of the averaged R2-score on future prediction horizons.Finally, in the pure batch reinforcement learning setting, we demonstrate that one-step models serve as strong baselines when dynamics are deterministic, while multi-step models would be more advantageous in the presence of noise, highlighting the potential of our approach in real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>Recent text-to-video diffusion models have achieved impressive progress.In practice, users often desire the ability to control object motion and camera movement independently for customized video creation.However, current methods lack the focus on separately controlling object motion and camera movement in a decoupled manner, which limits the controllability and flexibility of text-to-video models.In this paper, we introduce Direct-a-Video, a system that allows users to independently specify motions for one or multiple objects and/or camera movements, as if directing a video.We propose a simple yet effective strategy for the decoupled control of object motion and camera movement.Object motion is controlled through spatial cross-attention modulation using the model's inherent priors, requiring no additional optimization.For camera movement, we introduce new temporal cross-attention layers to interpret quantitative camera movement parameters.We further employ an augmentation-based approach to train these layers in a self-supervised manner on a small-scale dataset, eliminating the need for explicit motion annotation.Both components operate independently, allowing individual or combined control, and can generalize to open-domain scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>Project page: https://direct-a-video.github.io/.</p>

                  <p>Learning and predicting the performance of given software configurations are of high importance to many software engineering activities.While configurable software systems will almost certainly face diverse running environments (e.g., version, hardware, and workload), current work often either builds performance models under a single environment or fails to properly handle data from diverse settings, hence restricting their accuracy for new environments.In this paper, we target configuration performance learning under multiple environments.We do so by designing SeMPL - a meta-learning framework that learns the common understanding from configurations measured in distinct (meta) environments and generalizes them to the unforeseen, target environment.What makes it unique is that unlike common meta-learning frameworks (e.g., MAML and MetaSGD) that train the meta environments in parallel, we train them sequentially, one at a time.The order of training naturally allows discriminating the contributions among meta environments in the meta-model built, which fits better with the characteristic of configuration data that is known to dramatically differ between different environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through comparing with 15 state-of-the-art models under nine systems, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that SeMPL performs considerably better on 89% of the systems with up to 99% accuracy improvement, while being data-efficient, leading to a maximum of 3.86x speedup. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>All code and data can be found at our repository: https://github.com/ideas-labo/SeMPL.</p>

                  <p>It is common to observe performance degradation when transferring models trained on some (source) datasets to target testing data due to a domain gap between them.Existing methods for bridging this gap, such as domain adaptation (DA), may require the source data on which the model was trained (often not available), while others, i.e., source-free DA, require many passes through the testing data.We propose an online test-time adaptation method for depth completion, the task of inferring a dense depth map from a single image and associated sparse depth map, that closes the performance gap in a single pass.We first present a study on how the domain shift in each data modality affects model performance.Based on our observations that the sparse depth modality exhibits a much smaller covariate shift than the image, we design an embedding module trained in the source domain that preserves a mapping from features encoding only sparse depth to those encoding image and sparse depth.During test time, sparse depth features are projected using this map as a proxy for source domain features and are used as guidance to train a set of auxiliary parameters (i.e., adaptation layer) to align image and sparse depth features from the target test domain to that of the source domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on indoor and outdoor scenarios and show that it improves over baselines by an average of 21.1%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span></p>

                  <p>One of the most important challenges of Smart City Applications is to adapt the system to interact with non-expert users.Robot imitation frameworks aim to simplify and reduce times of robot programming by allowing users to program directly through demonstrations.In classical frameworks, actions are modeled using joint or Cartesian space trajectories.Other features, such as visual ones, are not always well represented with these pure geometrical approaches.Continuous Goal-Directed Actions (CGDA) is an alternative to these methods, as it encodes actions as changes of any feature that can be extracted from the environment.As a consequence of this, the robot joint trajectories for execution must be fully computed to comply with this feature-agnostic encoding.This is achieved using Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), which usually requires too many evaluations to perform this evolution step in the actual robot.Current strategies involve performing evaluations in a simulation, transferring the final joint trajectory to the actual robot.Smart City applications involve working in highly dynamic and complex environments, where having a precise model is not always achievable.Our goal is to study the tractability of performing these evaluations directly in a real-world scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Two different approaches to reduce the number of evaluations using EA, are proposed and compared. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>In the first approach, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based methods have been studied and compared within CGDA: naive PSO, Fitness Inheritance PSO (FI-PSO), and Adaptive Fuzzy Fitness Granulation with PSO (AFFG-PSO).The second approach studied the introduction of geometrical and velocity constraints within CGDA.The effects of both approaches were analyzed and compared in the wax and paint actions, two CGDA commonly studied use cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results from this paper depict an important reduction in the number of evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>Feature attribution methods (FAs), such as gradients and attention, are widely employed approaches to derive the importance of all input features to the model predictions.Existing work in natural language processing has mostly focused on developing and testing FAs for encoder-only language models (LMs) in classification tasks.However, it is unknown if it is faithful to use these FAs for decoder-only models on text generation, due to the inherent differences between model architectures and task settings respectively.Moreover, previous work has demonstrated that there is no `one-wins-all' FA across models and tasks.This makes the selection of a FA computationally expensive for large LMs since input importance derivation often requires multiple forward and backward passes including gradient computations that might be prohibitive even with access to large compute.To address these issues, we present a model-agnostic FA for generative LMs called Recursive Attribution Generator (ReAGent).Our method updates the token importance distribution in a recursive manner.For each update, we compute the difference in the probability distribution over the vocabulary for predicting the next token between using the original input and using a modified version where a part of the input is replaced with RoBERTa predictions.Our intuition is that replacing an important token in the context should have resulted in a larger change in the model's confidence in predicting the token than replacing an unimportant token.Our method can be universally applied to any generative LM without accessing internal model weights or additional training and fine-tuning, as most other FAs require.We extensively compare the faithfulness of ReAGent with seven popular FAs across six decoder-only LMs of various sizes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that our method consistently provides more faithful token importance distributions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, various contrastive learning techniques have been developed to categorize time series data and exhibit promising performance.A general paradigm is to utilize appropriate augmentations and construct feasible positive samples such that the encoder can yield robust and discriminative representations by mapping similar data points closer together in the feature space while pushing dissimilar data points farther apart.Despite its efficacy, the fine-grained relative similarity (e.g., rank) information of positive samples is largely ignored, especially when labeled samples are limited.To this end, we present Rank Supervised Contrastive Learning (RankSCL) to perform time series classification.Different from conventional contrastive learning frameworks, RankSCL augments raw data in a targeted way in the embedding space and adopts certain filtering rules to select more informative positive and negative pairs of samples.Moreover, a novel rank loss is developed to assign different weights for different levels of positive samples, enable the encoder to extract the fine-grained information of the same class, and produce a clear boundary among different classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thoroughly empirical studies on 128 UCR datasets and 30 UEA datasets demonstrate that the proposed RankSCL can achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span></p>

                  <p>Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation has recently garnered considerable attention, where fine-tuning plays a key role in LLMs' adaptation.However, the cost of fine-tuning LLMs on rapidly expanding recommendation data limits their practical application.To address this challenge, few-shot fine-tuning offers a promising approach to quickly adapt LLMs to new recommendation data.We propose the task of data pruning for efficient LLM-based recommendation, aimed at identifying representative samples tailored for LLMs' few-shot fine-tuning.While coreset selection is closely related to the proposed task, existing coreset selection methods often rely on suboptimal heuristic metrics or entail costly optimization on large-scale recommendation data.   To tackle these issues, we introduce two objectives for the data pruning task in the context of LLM-based recommendation: 1) high accuracy aims to identify the influential samples that can lead to high overall performance; and 2) high efficiency underlines the low costs of the data pruning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To pursue the two objectives, we propose a novel data pruning method based on two scores, i.e., influence score and effort score, to efficiently identify the influential samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Particularly, the influence score is introduced to accurately estimate the influence of sample removal on the overall performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>To achieve low costs of the data pruning process, we use a small-sized surrogate model to replace LLMs to obtain the influence score.Considering the potential gap between the surrogate model and LLMs, we further propose an effort score to prioritize some hard samples specifically for LLMs.Empirical results on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.In particular, the proposed method uses only 2% samples to surpass the full data fine-tuning, reducing time costs by 97%.</p>

                  <p>We construct a strong baseline method for building damage detection by starting with the highly-engineered winning solution of the xView2 competition, and gradually stripping away components.This way, we obtain a much simpler method, while retaining adequate performance.We expect the simplified solution to be more widely and easily applicable.This expectation is based on the reduced complexity, as well as the fact that we choose hyperparameters based on simple heuristics, that transfer to other datasets.We then re-arrange the xView2 dataset splits such that the test locations are not seen during training, contrary to the competition setup.In this setting, we find that both the complex and the simplified model fail to generalize to unseen locations.Analyzing the dataset indicates that this failure to generalize is not only a model-based problem, but that the difficulty might also be influenced by the unequal class distributions between events.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, including the baseline model, is available under https://github.com/PaulBorneP/Xview2_Strong_Baseline <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper addresses intervention-based causal representation learning (CRL) under a general nonparametric latent causal model and an unknown transformation that maps the latent variables to the observed variables.Linear and general transformations are investigated.The paper addresses both the \emph{identifiability} and \emph{achievability} aspects.Identifiability refers to determining algorithm-agnostic conditions that ensure recovering the true latent causal variables and the latent causal graph underlying them.Achievability refers to the algorithmic aspects and addresses designing algorithms that achieve identifiability guarantees.By drawing novel connections between \emph{score functions} (i.e., the gradients of the logarithm of density functions) and CRL, this paper designs a \emph{score-based class of algorithms} that ensures both identifiability and achievability.First, the paper focuses on \emph{linear} transformations and shows that one stochastic hard intervention per node suffices to guarantee identifiability.It also provides partial identifiability guarantees for soft interventions, including identifiability up to ancestors for general causal models and perfect latent graph recovery for sufficiently non-linear causal models.Secondly, it focuses on \emph{general} transformations and shows that two stochastic hard interventions per node suffice for identifiability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, one does \emph{not} need to know which pair of interventional environments have the same node intervened. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Engineers are responsible for assessing a product during every phase of the software development process to ensure that the outcomes of each phase and the final product possess the desired qualities.In general, a great SQA engineer needs to have a different set of abilities from development engineers to effectively oversee the entire product development process from beginning to end.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent empirical studies identified important attributes of software engineers and managers, but the quality assurance role is overlooked. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>As software quality aspects have become more of a priority in the life cycle of software development, employers seek professionals that best suit the company's objectives and new graduates desire to make a valuable contribution through their job as an SQA engineer, but what makes them great?We addressed this knowledge gap by conducting 25 semi-structured interviews and 363 survey respondents with software quality assurance engineers from different companies around the world.We use the data collected from these activities to derive a comprehensive set of attributes that are considered important.As a result of the interviews, twenty-five attributes were identified and grouped into five main categories: personal, social, technical, management, and decision-making attributes.Through a rating survey, we confirmed that the distinguishing characteristics of great SQA engineers are curiosity, the ability to communicate effectively, and critical thinking skills.This work will guide further studies with SQA practitioners, by considering contextual factors and providing some implications for research and practice.</p>
