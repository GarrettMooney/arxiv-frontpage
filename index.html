                  <p>Recently, 3D point cloud classification has made significant progress with the help of many datasets.However, these datasets do not reflect the incomplete nature of real-world point clouds caused by occlusion, which limits the practical application of current methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this gap, we propose ModelNet-O, a large-scale synthetic dataset of 123,041 samples that emulate real-world point clouds with self-occlusion caused by scanning from monocular cameras. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>ModelNet-O is 10 times larger than existing datasets and offers more challenging cases to evaluate the robustness of existing methods.Our observation on ModelNet-O reveals that well-designed sparse structures can preserve structural information of point clouds under occlusion, motivating us to propose a robust point cloud processing method that leverages a critical point sampling (CPS) strategy in a multi-level manner.We term our method PointMLS.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our PointMLS achieves state-of-the-art results on ModelNet-O and competitive results on regular datasets, and it is robust and effective.More experiments also demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of PointMLS.</p>

                  <p>The evolution of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been significantly influenced by six core challenges (Koehn and Knowles, 2017), which have acted as benchmarks for progress in this field.This study revisits these challenges, offering insights into their ongoing relevance in the context of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): domain mismatch, amount of parallel data, rare word prediction, translation of long sentences, attention model as word alignment, and sub-optimal beam search.Our empirical findings indicate that LLMs effectively lessen the reliance on parallel data for major languages in the pretraining phase.Additionally, the LLM-based translation system significantly enhances the translation of long sentences that contain approximately 80 words and shows the capability to translate documents of up to 512 words.However, despite these significant improvements, the challenges of domain mismatch and prediction of rare words persist.While the challenges of word alignment and beam search, specifically associated with NMT, may not apply to LLMs, we identify three new challenges for LLMs in translation tasks: inference efficiency, translation of low-resource languages in the pretraining phase, and human-aligned evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets and models are released at https://github.com/pangjh3/LLM4MT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span></p>

                  <p>There are two common ways in which developers are incorporating proprietary and domain-specific data when building applications of Large Language Models (LLMs): Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-Tuning.RAG augments the prompt with the external data, while fine-Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself.However, the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood.In this paper, we propose a pipeline for fine-tuning and RAG, and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs, including Llama2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.Our pipeline consists of multiple stages, including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers, using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results.We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine-Tuning pipeline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p.when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further.In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%.Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.</p>

                  <p>Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks in different modalities.However, existing multi-modal models primarily emphasize capturing global information within each modality while neglecting the importance of perceiving local information across modalities.Consequently, these models lack the ability to effectively understand the fine-grained details of input data, limiting their performance in tasks that require a more nuanced understanding.To address this limitation, there is a compelling need to develop models that enable fine-grained understanding across multiple modalities, thereby enhancing their applicability to a wide range of tasks.In this paper, we propose LEGO, a language enhanced multi-modal grounding model.Beyond capturing global information like other multi-modal models, our proposed model excels at tasks demanding a detailed understanding of local information within the input.It demonstrates precise identification and localization of specific regions in images or moments in videos.To achieve this objective, we design a diversified dataset construction pipeline, resulting in a multi-modal, multi-granularity dataset for model training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code, dataset, and demo of our model can be found at https: //github.com/lzw-lzw/LEGO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span></p>

                  <p>The argument sufficiency assessment task aims to determine if the premises of a given argument support its conclusion.To tackle this task, existing works often train a classifier on data annotated by humans.However, annotating data is laborious, and annotations are often inconsistent due to subjective criteria.Motivated by the probability of sufficiency (PS) definition in the causal literature, we propose CASA, a zero-shot causality-driven argument sufficiency assessment framework.PS measures how likely introducing the premise event would lead to the conclusion, when both the premise and conclusion events are absent.To estimate this probability, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to generate contexts that are inconsistent with the premise and conclusion, and revise them by injecting the premise event.Experiments on two logical fallacy detection datasets demonstrate that CASA accurately identifies insufficient arguments.We further deploy CASA in a writing assistance application, and find that suggestions generated by CASA enhance the sufficiency of student-written arguments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/xxxiaol/CASA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision and vision-language applications of neural networks, such as image classification and captioning, rely on large-scale annotated datasets that require non-trivial data-collecting processes.This time-consuming endeavor hinders the emergence of large-scale datasets, limiting researchers and practitioners to a small number of choices.Therefore, we seek more efficient ways to collect and annotate images.Previous initiatives have gathered captions from HTML alt-texts and crawled social media postings, but these data sources suffer from noise, sparsity, or subjectivity.For this reason, we turn to commercial shopping websites whose data meet three criteria: cleanliness, informativeness, and fluency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the Let's Go Shopping (LGS) dataset, a large-scale public dataset with 15 million image-caption pairs from publicly available e-commerce websites. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.865</span></span>When compared with existing general-domain datasets, the LGS images focus on the foreground object and have less complex backgrounds.Our experiments on LGS show that the classifiers trained on existing benchmark datasets do not readily generalize to e-commerce data, while specific self-supervised visual feature extractors can better generalize.Furthermore, LGS's high-quality e-commerce-focused images and bimodal nature make it advantageous for vision-language bi-modal tasks: LGS enables image-captioning models to generate richer captions and helps text-to-image generation models achieve e-commerce style transfer.</p>

                  <p>The enormous demand for seafood products has led to exploitation of marine resources and near-extinction of some species.In particular, overfishing is one the main issues in sustainable marine development.In alignment with the protection of marine resources and sustainable fishing, this study proposes to advance fish classification techniques that support identifying protected fish species using state-of-the-art machine learning.We use a custom modification of the MobileNet model to design a lightweight classifier called M-MobileNet that is capable of running on limited hardware.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As part of the study, we compiled a labeled dataset of 37,462 images of fish found in the waters of the Indonesian archipelago. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.888</span></span>The proposed model is trained on the dataset to classify images of the captured fish into their species and give recommendations on whether they are consumable or not.Our modified MobileNet model uses only 50\% of the top layer parameters with about 42% GTX 860M utility and achieves up to 97% accuracy in fish classification and determining its consumability.Given the limited computing capacity available on many fishing vessels, the proposed model provides a practical solution to on-site fish classification.In addition, synchronized implementation of the proposed model on multiple vessels can supply valuable information about the movement and location of different species of fish.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of text-to-image generative models has revolutionized the field of deepfakes, enabling the creation of realistic and convincing visual content directly from textual descriptions.However, this advancement presents considerably greater challenges in detecting the authenticity of such content.Existing deepfake detection datasets and methods often fall short in effectively capturing the extensive range of emerging deepfakes and offering satisfactory explanatory information for detection.To address the significant issue, this paper introduces a deepfake database (DFLIP-3K) for the development of convincing and explainable deepfake detection.It encompasses about 300K diverse deepfake samples from approximately 3K generative models, which boasts the largest number of deepfake models in the literature.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, it collects around 190K linguistic footprints of these deepfakes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>The two distinguished features enable DFLIP-3K to develop a benchmark that promotes progress in linguistic profiling of deepfakes, which includes three sub-tasks namely deepfake detection, model identification, and prompt prediction.The deepfake model and prompt are two essential components of each deepfake, and thus dissecting them linguistically allows for an invaluable exploration of trustworthy and interpretable evidence in deepfake detection, which we believe is the key for the next-generation deepfake detection.Furthermore, DFLIP-3K is envisioned as an open database that fosters transparency and encourages collaborative efforts to further enhance its growth.Our extensive experiments on the developed benchmark verify that our DFLIP-3K database is capable of serving as a standardized resource for evaluating and comparing linguistic-based deepfake detection, identification, and prompt prediction techniques.</p>

We show that using gradient boosting decision trees at the Knowledge Neuron layer, i.e., at the hidden layer of the feed-forward network of the transformer as a probing classifier for recognizing parts of a sentence is more advantageous than using logistic regression on the output representations of the transformer layer.This approach is also preferable to many other methods.The gain in error rate, depending on the preset, ranges from 9-54%</p>

                  <p>In modern machine learning, the trend of harnessing self-supervised learning to derive high-quality representations without label dependency has garnered significant attention.However, the absence of label information, coupled with the inherently high-dimensional nature, improves the difficulty for the interpretation of learned representations.Consequently, indirect evaluations become the popular metric for evaluating the quality of these features, leading to a biased validation of the learned representation rationale.To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Concept-based Explainable Image Representation (CEIR).Initially, using the Concept-based Model (CBM) incorporated with pretrained CLIP and concepts generated by GPT-4, we project input images into a concept vector space.Subsequently, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) learns the latent representation from these projected concepts, which serves as the final image representation.Due to the capability of the representation to encapsulate high-level, semantically relevant concepts, the model allows for attributions to a human-comprehensible concept space.This not only enhances interpretability but also preserves the robustness essential for downstream tasks.For instance, our method exhibits state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering performance on benchmarks such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10.Furthermore, capitalizing on the universality of human conceptual understanding, CEIR can seamlessly extract the related concept from open-world images without fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This offers a fresh approach to automatic label generation and label manipulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Projected Gradient Ascent (PGA) is the most commonly used optimization scheme in machine learning and operations research areas.Nevertheless, numerous studies and examples have shown that the PGA methods may fail to achieve the tight approximation ratio for continuous DR-submodular maximization problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this challenge, we present a boosting technique in this paper, which can efficiently improve the approximation guarantee of the standard PGA to \emph{optimal} with only small modifications on the objective function. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>The fundamental idea of our boosting technique is to exploit non-oblivious search to derive a novel auxiliary function $F$, whose stationary points are excellent approximations to the global maximum of the original DR-submodular objective $f$. Specifically, when $f$ is monotone and $\gamma$-weakly DR-submodular, we propose an auxiliary function $F$ whose stationary points can provide a better $(1-e^{-\gamma})$-approximation than the $(\gamma^2/(1+\gamma^2))$-approximation guaranteed by the stationary points of $f$ itself.Similarly, for the non-monotone case, we devise another auxiliary function $F$ whose stationary points can achieve an optimal $\frac{1-\min_{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathcal{C}}\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_{\infty}}{4}$-approximation guarantee where $\mathcal{C}$ is a convex constraint set.In contrast, the stationary points of the original non-monotone DR-submodular function can be arbitrarily bad~\citep{chen2023continuous}.Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of our boosting technique on four problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In all of these four problems, our resulting variants of boosting PGA algorithm beat the previous standard PGA in several aspects such as approximation ratio and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our boosting PGA methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

                  <p>We are given a set $\mathcal{Z}=\{(R_1,s_1),\ldots, (R_n,s_n)\}$, where each $R_i$ is a \emph{range} in $\Re^d$, such as rectangle or ball, and $s_i \in[0,1]$ denotes its \emph{selectivity}.The goal is to compute a small-size \emph{discrete data distribution} $\mathcal{D}=\{(q_1,w_1),\ldots, (q_m,w_m)\}$, where $q_j\in \Re^d$ and $w_j\in[0,1]$ for each $1\leq j\leq m$, and $\sum_{1\leq j\leq m}w_j= 1$, such that $\mathcal{D}$ is the most \emph{consistent} with $\mathcal{Z}$, i.e., $\mathrm{err}_p(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{Z})=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\! \lvert{s_i-\sum_{j=1}^m w_j\cdot 1(q_j\in R_i)}\rvert^p$ is minimized.In a database setting, $\mathcal{Z}$ corresponds to a workload of range queries over some table, together with their observed selectivities (i.e., fraction of tuples returned), and $\mathcal{D}$ can be used as compact model for approximating the data distribution within the table without accessing the underlying contents.   In this paper, we obtain both upper and lower bounds for this problem.In particular, we show that the problem of finding the best data distribution from selectivity queries is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete.On the positive side, we describe a Monte Carlo algorithm that constructs, in time $O((n+\delta^{-d})\delta^{-2}\mathop{\mathrm{polylog}})$, a discrete distribution $\tilde{\mathcal{D}}$ of size $O(\delta^{-2})$, such that $\mathrm{err}_p(\tilde{\mathcal{D}},\mathcal{Z})\leq \min_{\mathcal{D}}\mathrm{err}_p(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{Z})+\delta$ (for $p=1,2,\infty$) where the minimum is taken over all discrete distributions.We also establish conditional lower bounds, which strongly indicate the infeasibility of relative approximations as well as removal of the exponential dependency on the dimension for additive approximations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This suggests that significant improvements to our algorithm are unlikely. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>The verbalizer, which serves to map label words to class labels, is an essential component of prompt-tuning.In this paper, we present a novel approach to constructing verbalizers.While existing methods for verbalizer construction mainly rely on augmenting and refining sets of synonyms or related words based on class names, this paradigm suffers from a narrow perspective and lack of abstraction, resulting in limited coverage and high bias in the label-word space.To address this issue, we propose a label-word construction process that incorporates scenario-specific concepts.Specifically, we extract rich concepts from task-specific scenarios as label-word candidates and then develop a novel cascade calibration module to refine the candidates into a set of label words for each class.We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through extensive experiments on {five} widely used datasets for zero-shot text classification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span></p>

                  <p>No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) aims to predict image quality scores consistent with human perception without relying on pristine reference images, serving as a crucial component in various visual tasks.Ensuring the robustness of NR-IQA methods is vital for reliable comparisons of different image processing techniques and consistent user experiences in recommendations.The attack methods for NR-IQA provide a powerful instrument to test the robustness of NR-IQA.However, current attack methods of NR-IQA heavily rely on the gradient of the NR-IQA model, leading to limitations when the gradient information is unavailable.In this paper, we present a pioneering query-based black box attack against NR-IQA methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose the concept of \emph{score boundary} and leverage an adaptive iterative approach with multiple score boundaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>Meanwhile, the initial attack directions are also designed to leverage the characteristics of the Human Visual System (HVS).Experiments show our attack method outperforms all compared state-of-the-art methods and is far ahead of previous black-box methods.The effective DBCNN model suffers a Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) decline of $0.6972$ attacked by our method, revealing the vulnerability of NR-IQA to black-box attacks.The proposed attack method also provides a potent tool for further exploration into NR-IQA robustness.</p>

                  <p>Purpose: Body composition measurements from routine abdominal CT can yield personalized risk assessments for asymptomatic and diseased patients.In particular, attenuation and volume measures of muscle and fat are associated with important clinical outcomes, such as cardiovascular events, fractures, and death.This study evaluates the reliability of an Internal tool for the segmentation of muscle and fat (subcutaneous and visceral) as compared to the well-established public TotalSegmentator tool.   Methods: We assessed the tools across 900 CT series from the publicly available SAROS dataset, focusing on muscle, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat.The Dice score was employed to assess accuracy in subcutaneous fat and muscle segmentation.Due to the lack of ground truth segmentations for visceral fat, Cohen's Kappa was utilized to assess segmentation agreement between the tools.   Results:Our Internal tool achieved a 3% higher Dice (83.8 vs. 80.8) for subcutaneous fat and a 5% improvement (87.6 vs. 83.2) for muscle segmentation respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that our results were statistically different with p<0.01. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>For visceral fat, the Cohen's kappa score of 0.856 indicated near-perfect agreement between the two tools.Our internal tool also showed very strong correlations for muscle volume (R^2=0.99), muscle attenuation (R^2=0.93), and subcutaneous fat volume (R^2=0.99) with a moderate correlation for subcutaneous fat attenuation (R^2=0.45).   Conclusion: Our findings indicated that our Internal tool outperformed TotalSegmentator in measuring subcutaneous fat and muscle.The high Cohen's Kappa score for visceral fat suggests a reliable level of agreement between the two tools.These results demonstrate the potential of our tool in advancing the accuracy of body composition analysis.</p>

                  <p>Existing photorealistic relightable hand models require extensive identity-specific observations in different views, poses, and illuminations, and face challenges in generalizing to natural illuminations and novel identities.To bridge this gap, we present URHand, the first universal relightable hand model that generalizes across viewpoints, poses, illuminations, and identities.Our model allows few-shot personalization using images captured with a mobile phone, and is ready to be photorealistically rendered under novel illuminations.To simplify the personalization process while retaining photorealism, we build a powerful universal relightable prior based on neural relighting from multi-view images of hands captured in a light stage with hundreds of identities.The key challenge is scaling the cross-identity training while maintaining personalized fidelity and sharp details without compromising generalization under natural illuminations.To this end, we propose a spatially varying linear lighting model as the neural renderer that takes physics-inspired shading as input feature.By removing non-linear activations and bias, our specifically designed lighting model explicitly keeps the linearity of light transport.This enables single-stage training from light-stage data while generalizing to real-time rendering under arbitrary continuous illuminations across diverse identities.In addition, we introduce the joint learning of a physically based model and our neural relighting model, which further improves fidelity and generalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of both quality and generalizability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>We also demonstrate quick personalization of URHand from a short phone scan of an unseen identity.</p>

                  <p>Data races are egregious parallel programming bugs on CPUs.They are even worse on GPUs due to the hierarchical thread and memory structure, which makes it possible to write code that is correctly synchronized within a thread group while not being correct across groups.Thus far, all major data-race checkers for GPUs suffer from at least one of the following problems: they do not check races in global memory, do not work on recent GPUs, scale poorly, have not been extensively tested, miss simple data races, or are not dependable without detailed knowledge of the compiler.   Our new data-race detection tool, HiRace, overcomes these limitations.Its key novelty is an innovative parallel finite-state machine that condenses an arbitrarily long access history into a constant-length state, thus allowing it to handle large and long-running programs.HiRace is a dynamic tool that checks for thread-group shared memory and global device memory races.It utilizes source-code instrumentation, thus avoiding driver, compiler, and hardware dependencies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate it on a modern calibrated data-race benchmark suite. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>On the 580 tested CUDA kernels, 346 of which contain data races, HiRace finds races missed by other tools without false alarms and is more than 10 times faster on average than the current state of the art, while incurring only half the memory overhead.</p>

                  <p>The large number of parameters in Pretrained Language Models enhance their performance, but also make them resource-intensive, making it challenging to deploy them on commodity hardware like a single GPU.Due to the memory and power limitations of these devices, model compression techniques are often used to decrease both the model's size and its inference latency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This usually results in a trade-off between model accuracy and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Therefore, optimizing this balance is essential for effectively deploying LLMs on commodity hardware.A significant portion of the efficiency challenge is the Feed-forward network (FFN) component, which accounts for roughly $\frac{2}{3}$ total parameters and inference latency.In this paper, we first observe that only a few neurons of FFN module have large output norm for any input tokens, a.k.a. heavy hitters, while the others are sparsely triggered by different tokens.Based on this observation, we explicitly split the FFN into two parts according to the heavy hitters.We improve the efficiency-accuracy trade-off of existing compression methods by allocating more resource to FFN parts with heavy hitters.In practice, our method can reduce model size by 43.1\% and bring $1.25\sim1.56\times$ wall clock time speedup on different hardware with negligible accuracy drop.</p>

We build upon the recommender that has been in production since 2018, RevRecV1.We found that reviewers were being assigned based on prior authorship of files.We reviewed the literature for successful features and experimented with them with RevRecV2 in production.The most important feature in our new model was the familiarity of the author and reviewer, we saw an overall improvement in accuracy of 14 percentage points.   Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

We conduct historical analyses to understand the natural concentration of review workload and the degree of knowledge spreading that is inherent in code review.Even though review workload is highly concentrated, we show that code review natural spreads knowledge thereby reducing the files at risk to turnover.   Using simulation, we evaluate existing code review recommenders and develop novel recommenders to understand their impact on the level of expertise during review, the workload of reviewers, and the files at risk to turnover.Our simulations use seeded random replacement of reviewers to allow us to compare the reviewer recommenders without the confounding variation of different reviewers being replaced for each recommender.   Combining recommenders, we develop the SofiaWL recommender that suggests experts with low active review workload when none of the files under review are known by only one developer.In contrast, when knowledge is concentrated on one developer, it sends the review to other reviewers to spread knowledge.For the projects we study, we are able to globally increase expertise during reviews, +3%, reduce workload concentration, -12%, and reduce the files at risk, -28%.We make our scripts and data available in our replication package.Developers can optimize for a particular outcome measure based on the needs of their project, or use our GitHub bot to automatically balance the outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment is crucial for the sustained progress of open source development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the prevalence of negative discourse, often manifested as toxic comments, poses significant challenges to developer well-being and productivity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>To identify such negativity in project communications, especially within large projects, automated toxicity detection models are necessary.To train these models effectively, we need large software engineering-specific toxicity datasets.However, such datasets are limited in availability and often exhibit imbalance (e.g., only 6 in 1000 GitHub issues are toxic), posing challenges for training effective toxicity detection models.To address this problem, we explore a zero-shot LLM (ChatGPT) that is pre-trained on massive datasets but without being fine-tuned specifically for the task of detecting toxicity in software-related text.Our preliminary evaluation indicates that ChatGPT shows promise in detecting toxicity in GitHub, and warrants further investigation.We experimented with various prompts, including those designed for justifying model outputs, thereby enhancing model interpretability and paving the way for potential integration of ChatGPT-enabled toxicity detection into developer communication channels.</p>
