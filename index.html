                  <p>Transparent objects are encountered frequently in our daily lives, yet recognizing them poses challenges for conventional vision sensors due to their unique material properties, not being well perceived from RGB or depth cameras.Overcoming this limitation, thermal infrared cameras have emerged as a solution, offering improved visibility and shape information for transparent objects.In this paper, we present TRansPose, the first large-scale multispectral dataset that combines stereo RGB-D, thermal infrared (TIR) images, and object poses to promote transparent object research.The dataset includes 99 transparent objects, encompassing 43 household items, 27 recyclable trashes, 29 chemical laboratory equivalents, and 12 non-transparent objects.It comprises a vast collection of 333,819 images and 4,000,056 annotations, providing instance-level segmentation masks, ground-truth poses, and completed depth information.The data was acquired using a FLIR A65 thermal infrared (TIR) camera, two Intel RealSense L515 RGB-D cameras, and a Franka Emika Panda robot manipulator.Spanning 87 sequences, TRansPose covers various challenging real-life scenarios, including objects filled with water, diverse lighting conditions, heavy clutter, non-transparent or translucent containers, objects in plastic bags, and multi-stacked objects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TRansPose dataset can be accessed from the following link: https://sites.google.com/view/transpose-dataset</span></p>

                  <p>Nighttime surveillance suffers from degradation due to poor illumination and arduous human annotations.It is challengable and remains a security risk at night.Existing methods rely on multi-spectral images to perceive objects in the dark, which are troubled by low resolution and color absence.We argue that the ultimate solution for nighttime surveillance is night-to-day translation, or Night2Day, which aims to translate a surveillance scene from nighttime to the daytime while maintaining semantic consistency.To achieve this, this paper presents a Disentangled Contrastive (DiCo) learning method.Specifically, to address the poor and complex illumination in the nighttime scenes, we propose a learnable physical prior, i.e., the color invariant, which provides a stable perception of a highly dynamic night environment and can be incorporated into the learning pipeline of neural networks.Targeting the surveillance scenes, we develop a disentangled representation, which is an auxiliary pretext task that separates surveillance scenes into the foreground and background with contrastive learning.Such a strategy can extract the semantics without supervision and boost our model to achieve instance-aware translation.Finally, we incorporate all the modules above into generative adversarial networks and achieve high-fidelity translation.This paper also contributes a new surveillance dataset called NightSuR.It includes six scenes to support the study on nighttime surveillance.This dataset collects nighttime images with different properties of nighttime environments, such as flare and extreme darkness.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing works significantly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and source code will be released on GitHub soon.</span></p>

                  <p>Given a set of calibrated images of a scene, we present an approach that produces a simple, compact, and actionable 3D world representation by means of 3D primitives.While many approaches focus on recovering high-fidelity 3D scenes, we focus on parsing a scene into mid-level 3D representations made of a small set of textured primitives.Such representations are interpretable, easy to manipulate and suited for physics-based simulations.Moreover, unlike existing primitive decomposition methods that rely on 3D input data, our approach operates directly on images through differentiable rendering.Specifically, we model primitives as textured superquadric meshes and optimize their parameters from scratch with an image rendering loss.We highlight the importance of modeling transparency for each primitive, which is critical for optimization and also enables handling varying numbers of primitives.We show that the resulting textured primitives faithfully reconstruct the input images and accurately model the visible 3D points, while providing amodal shape completions of unseen object regions.We compare our approach to the state of the art on diverse scenes from DTU, and demonstrate its robustness on real-life captures from BlendedMVS and Nerfstudio.We also showcase how our results can be used to effortlessly edit a scene or perform physical simulations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and video results are available at https://www.tmonnier.com/DBW .</span></p>

                  <p>Tabular data -- also known as structured data -- is one of the most common data forms in existence, thanks to the stable development and scaled deployment of database systems in the last few decades.At present however, despite the blast brought by large pre-trained models in other domains such as ChatGPT or SAM, how can we extract common knowledge across tables at a scale that may eventually lead to generalizable representation for tabular data remains a full blank.Indeed, there have been a few works around this topic.Most (if not all) of them are limited in the scope of a single table or fixed form of a schema.In this work, we first identify the crucial research challenges behind tabular data pre-training, particularly towards the cross-table scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We position the contribution of this work in two folds: (i)-we collect and curate nearly 2k high-quality tabular datasets, each of which is guaranteed to possess clear semantics, clean labels, and other necessary meta information.</span>(ii)-we propose a novel framework that allows cross-table pre-training dubbed as CT-BERT.Noticeably, in light of pioneering the scaled cross-table training, CT-BERT is fully compatible with both supervised and self-supervised schemes, where the specific instantiation of CT-BERT is very much dependent on the downstream tasks.We further propose and implement a contrastive-learning-based and masked table modeling (MTM) objective into CT-BERT, that is inspired from computer vision and natural language processing communities but sophistically tailored to tables.The extensive empirical results on 15 datasets demonstrate CT-BERT's state-of-the-art performance, where both its supervised and self-supervised setups significantly outperform the prior approaches.</p>

                  <p>The analysis of building models for usable area, building safety, and energy use requires accurate classification data of spaces and space elements.To reduce input model preparation effort and errors, automated classification of spaces and space elements is desirable.A barrier hindering the utilization of Graph Deep Learning (GDL) methods to space function and space element classification is a lack of suitable datasets.To bridge this gap, we introduce a dataset, SAGC-A68, which comprises access graphs automatically generated from 68 digital 3D models of space layouts of apartment buildings.This graph-based dataset is well-suited for developing GDL models for space function and space element classification.To demonstrate the potential of the dataset, we employ it to train and evaluate a graph attention network (GAT) that predicts 22 space function and 6 space element classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code used in the experiment are available online.</span>https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7805872, https://github.com/A2Amir/SAGC-A68.</p>

                  <p>Age and gender recognition in the wild is a highly challenging task: apart from the variability of conditions, pose complexities, and varying image quality, there are cases where the face is partially or completely occluded.We present MiVOLO (Multi Input VOLO), a straightforward approach for age and gender estimation using the latest vision transformer.Our method integrates both tasks into a unified dual input/output model, leveraging not only facial information but also person image data.This improves the generalization ability of our model and enables it to deliver satisfactory results even when the face is not visible in the image.To evaluate our proposed model, we conduct experiments on four popular benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art performance, while demonstrating real-time processing capabilities.Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark based on images from the Open Images Dataset.The ground truth annotations for this benchmark have been meticulously generated by human annotators, resulting in high accuracy answers due to the smart aggregation of votes.Furthermore, we compare our model's age recognition performance with human-level accuracy and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms humans across a majority of age ranges.Finally, we grant public access to our models, along with the code for validation and inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we provide extra annotations for used datasets and introduce our new benchmark.</span></p>

                  <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health threat, causing millions of deaths annually.Although early diagnosis and treatment can greatly improve the chances of survival, it remains a major challenge, especially in developing countries.Recently, computer-aided tuberculosis diagnosis (CTD) using deep learning has shown promise, but progress is hindered by limited training data.To address this, we establish a large-scale dataset, namely the Tuberculosis X-ray (TBX11K) dataset, which contains 11,200 chest X-ray (CXR) images with corresponding bounding box annotations for TB areas.This dataset enables the training of sophisticated detectors for high-quality CTD.Furthermore, we propose a strong baseline, SymFormer, for simultaneous CXR image classification and TB infection area detection.SymFormer incorporates Symmetric Search Attention (SymAttention) to tackle the bilateral symmetry property of CXR images for learning discriminative features.Since CXR images may not strictly adhere to the bilateral symmetry property, we also propose Symmetric Positional Encoding (SPE) to facilitate SymAttention through feature recalibration.To promote future research on CTD, we build a benchmark by introducing evaluation metrics, evaluating baseline models reformed from existing detectors, and running an online challenge.Experiments show that SymFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TBX11K dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data, code, and models will be released.</span></p>

                  <p>Recently, the release of INSTRUCTEVAL has provided valuable insights into the performance of large language models (LLMs) that utilize encoder-decoder or decoder-only architecture.Interestingly, despite being introduced four years ago, T5-based LLMs, such as FLAN-T5, continue to outperform the latest decoder-based LLMs, such as LLAMA and VICUNA, on tasks that require general problem-solving skills.This performance discrepancy can be attributed to three key factors: (1) Pre-training data, (2) Backbone architecture, and (3) Instruction dataset.In this technical report, our main focus is on investigating the impact of the third factor by leveraging VICUNA, a large language model based on LLAMA, which has undergone fine-tuning on ChatGPT conversations.To achieve this objective, we fine-tuned VICUNA using a customized instruction dataset collection called FLANMINI.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This collection includes a subset of the large-scale instruction dataset known as FLAN, as well as various code-related datasets and conversational datasets derived from ChatGPT/GPT-4.</span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset comprises a large number of tasks that demand problem-solving skills.</span>Our experimental findings strongly indicate that the enhanced problem-solving abilities of our model, FLACUNA, are obtained through fine-tuning VICUNA on the FLAN dataset, leading to significant improvements across numerous benchmark datasets in INSTRUCTEVAL.FLACUNA is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/flacuna-13b-v1.0.</p>

                  <p>Recent work has explored Large Language Models (LLMs) to overcome the lack of training data for Information Retrieval (IR) tasks.The generalization abilities of these models have enabled the creation of synthetic in-domain data by providing instructions and a few examples on a prompt.InPars and Promptagator have pioneered this approach and both methods have demonstrated the potential of using LLMs as synthetic data generators for IR tasks.This makes them an attractive solution for IR tasks that suffer from a lack of annotated data.However, the reproducibility of these methods was limited, because InPars' training scripts are based on TPUs -- which are not widely accessible -- and because the code for Promptagator was not released and its proprietary LLM is not publicly accessible.To fully realize the potential of these methods and make their impact more widespread in the research community, the resources need to be accessible and easy to reproduce by researchers and practitioners.Our main contribution is a unified toolkit for end-to-end reproducible synthetic data generation research, which includes generation, filtering, training and evaluation.Additionally, we provide an interface to IR libraries widely used by the community and support for GPU.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our toolkit not only reproduces the InPars method and partially reproduces Promptagator, but also provides a plug-and-play functionality allowing the use of different LLMs, exploring filtering methods and finetuning various reranker models on the generated data.</span>We also made available all the synthetic data generated in this work for the 18 different datasets in the BEIR benchmark which took more than 2,000 GPU hours to be generated as well as the reranker models finetuned on the synthetic data.Code and data are available at https://github.com/zetaalphavector/InPars</p>

                  <p>Textual noise, such as typos or abbreviations, is a well-known issue that penalizes vanilla Transformers for most downstream tasks.We show that this is also the case for sentence similarity, a fundamental task in multiple domains, e.g. matching, retrieval or paraphrasing.Sentence similarity can be approached using cross-encoders, where the two sentences are concatenated in the input allowing the model to exploit the inter-relations between them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous works addressing the noise issue mainly rely on data augmentation strategies, showing improved robustness when dealing with corrupted samples that are similar to the ones used for training.</span>However, all these methods still suffer from the token distribution shift induced by typos.In this work, we propose to tackle textual noise by equipping cross-encoders with a novel LExical-aware Attention module (LEA) that incorporates lexical similarities between words in both sentences.By using raw text similarities, our approach avoids the tokenization shift problem obtaining improved robustness.We demonstrate that the attention bias introduced by LEA helps cross-encoders to tackle complex scenarios with textual noise, specially in domains with short-text descriptions and limited context.Experiments using three popular Transformer encoders in five e-commerce datasets for product matching show that LEA consistently boosts performance under the presence of noise, while remaining competitive on the original (clean) splits.We also evaluate our approach in two datasets for textual entailment and paraphrasing showing that LEA is robust to typos in domains with longer sentences and more natural context.Additionally, we thoroughly analyze several design choices in our approach, providing insights about the impact of the decisions made and fostering future research in cross-encoders dealing with typos.</p>

                  <p>Entity alignment (EA) aims at identifying equivalent entity pairs across different knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world identity.To systematically combat confirmation bias for pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment, we propose a Unified Pseudo-Labeling framework for Entity Alignment (UPL-EA) that explicitly eliminates pseudo-labeling errors to boost the accuracy of entity alignment.UPL-EA consists of two complementary components: (1) The Optimal Transport (OT)-based pseudo-labeling uses discrete OT modeling as an effective means to enable more accurate determination of entity correspondences across two KGs and to mitigate the adverse impact of erroneous matches.A simple but highly effective criterion is further devised to derive pseudo-labeled entity pairs that satisfy one-to-one correspondences at each iteration.(2) The cross-iteration pseudo-label calibration operates across multiple consecutive iterations to further improve the pseudo-labeling precision rate by reducing the local pseudo-label selection variability with a theoretical guarantee.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The two components are respectively designed to eliminate Type I and Type II pseudo-labeling errors identified through our analyse.</span>The calibrated pseudo-labels are thereafter used to augment prior alignment seeds to reinforce subsequent model training for alignment inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of UPL-EA in eliminating pseudo-labeling errors is both theoretically supported and experimentally validated.</span>The experimental results show that our approach achieves competitive performance with limited prior alignment seeds.</p>

                  <p>For safety, AI systems in health undergo thorough evaluations before deployment, validating their predictions against a ground truth that is assumed certain.However, this is actually not the case and the ground truth may be uncertain.Unfortunately, this is largely ignored in standard evaluation of AI models but can have severe consequences such as overestimating the future performance.To avoid this, we measure the effects of ground truth uncertainty, which we assume decomposes into two main components: annotation uncertainty which stems from the lack of reliable annotations, and inherent uncertainty due to limited observational information.This ground truth uncertainty is ignored when estimating the ground truth by deterministically aggregating annotations, e.g., by majority voting or averaging.In contrast, we propose a framework where aggregation is done using a statistical model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we frame aggregation of annotations as posterior inference of so-called plausibilities, representing distributions over classes in a classification setting, subject to a hyper-parameter encoding annotator reliability.</span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this model, we propose a metric for measuring annotation uncertainty and provide uncertainty-adjusted metrics for performance evaluation.</span>We present a case study applying our framework to skin condition classification from images where annotations are provided in the form of differential diagnoses.The deterministic adjudication process called inverse rank normalization (IRN) from previous work ignores ground truth uncertainty in evaluation.Instead, we present two alternative statistical models: a probabilistic version of IRN and a Plackett-Luce-based model.We find that a large portion of the dataset exhibits significant ground truth uncertainty and standard IRN-based evaluation severely over-estimates performance without providing uncertainty estimates.</p>

                  <p>Large language models trained for safety and harmlessness remain susceptible to adversarial misuse, as evidenced by the prevalence of "jailbreak" attacks on early releases of ChatGPT that elicit undesired behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Going beyond recognition of the issue, we investigate why such attacks succeed and how they can be created.</span>We hypothesize two failure modes of safety training: competing objectives and mismatched generalization.Competing objectives arise when a model's capabilities and safety goals conflict, while mismatched generalization occurs when safety training fails to generalize to a domain for which capabilities exist.We use these failure modes to guide jailbreak design and then evaluate state-of-the-art models, including OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude v1.3, against both existing and newly designed attacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that vulnerabilities persist despite the extensive red-teaming and safety-training efforts behind these models.</span>Notably, new attacks utilizing our failure modes succeed on every prompt in a collection of unsafe requests from the models' red-teaming evaluation sets and outperform existing ad hoc jailbreaks.Our analysis emphasizes the need for safety-capability parity -- that safety mechanisms should be as sophisticated as the underlying model -- and argues against the idea that scaling alone can resolve these safety failure modes.</p>
