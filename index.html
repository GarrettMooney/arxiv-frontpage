                Beyond Generic: Enhancing Image Captioning with Real-World Knowledge using Vision-Language Pre-Training Model

                  <p>Current captioning approaches tend to generate correct but "generic" descriptions that lack real-world knowledge, e.g., named entities and contextual information.Considering that Vision-Language Pre-Training (VLP) models master massive such knowledge from large-scale web-harvested data, it is promising to utilize the generalizability of VLP models to incorporate knowledge into image descriptions.However, using VLP models faces challenges: zero-shot inference suffers from knowledge hallucination that leads to low-quality descriptions, but the generic bias in downstream task fine-tuning hinders the VLP model from expressing knowledge.To address these concerns, we propose a simple yet effective method called Knowledge-guided Replay (K-Replay), which enables the retention of pre-training knowledge during fine-tuning.Our approach consists of two parts: (1) a knowledge prediction task on automatically collected replay exemplars to continuously awaken the VLP model's memory about knowledge, thus preventing the model from collapsing into the generic pattern; (2) a knowledge distillation constraint to improve the faithfulness of generated descriptions hence alleviating the knowledge hallucination.To evaluate knowledge-enhanced descriptions, we construct a novel captioning benchmark KnowCap, containing knowledge of landmarks, famous brands, special foods and movie characters.Experimental results show that our approach effectively incorporates knowledge into descriptions, outperforming strong VLP baseline by 20.9 points (78.7->99.6) in CIDEr score and 20.5 percentage points (34.0%->54.5%) in knowledge recognition accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data is available at https://github.com/njucckevin/KnowCap. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span></p>

                  <p>Digital preservation of Cultural Heritage (CH) sites is crucial to protect them against damage from natural disasters or human activities.Creating 3D models of CH sites has become a popular method of digital preservation thanks to advancements in computer vision and photogrammetry.However, the process is time-consuming, expensive, and typically requires specialized equipment and expertise, posing challenges in resource-limited developing countries.Additionally, the lack of an open repository for 3D models hinders research and public engagement with their heritage.To address these issues, we propose Tirtha, a web platform for crowdsourcing images of CH sites and creating their 3D models.Tirtha utilizes state-of-the-art Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques.It is modular, extensible and cost-effective, allowing for the incorporation of new techniques as photogrammetry advances.Tirtha is accessible through a web interface at https://tirtha.niser.ac.in and can be deployed on-premise or in a cloud environment.In our case studies, we demonstrate the pipeline's effectiveness by creating 3D models of temples in Odisha, India, using crowdsourced images.These models are available for viewing, interaction, and download on the Tirtha website.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work aims to provide a dataset of crowdsourced images and 3D reconstructions for research in computer vision, heritage conservation, and related domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.909</span></span>Overall, Tirtha is a step towards democratizing digital preservation, primarily in resource-limited developing countries.</p>

                  <p>Optical character recognition (OCR) methods have been applied to diverse tasks, e.g., street view text recognition and document analysis.Recently, zero-shot OCR has piqued the interest of the research community because it considers a practical OCR scenario with unbalanced data distribution.However, there is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating such zero-shot methods that apply a divide-and-conquer recognition strategy by decomposing characters into radicals.Meanwhile, radical recognition, as another important OCR task, also lacks radical-level annotation for model training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we construct an ancient Chinese character image dataset that contains both radical-level and character-level annotations to satisfy the requirements of the above-mentioned methods, namely, ACCID, where radical-level annotations include radical categories, radical locations, and structural relations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>To increase the adaptability of ACCID, we propose a splicing-based synthetic character algorithm to augment the training samples and apply an image denoising method to improve the image quality.By introducing character decomposition and recombination, we propose a baseline method for zero-shot OCR.The experimental results demonstrate the validity of ACCID and the baseline model quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

                  <p>Retriever-augmented instruction-following models are attractive alternatives to fine-tuned approaches for information-seeking tasks such as question answering (QA).By simply prepending retrieved documents in its input along with an instruction, these models can be adapted to various information domains and tasks without additional fine-tuning.While the model responses tend to be natural and fluent, the additional verbosity makes traditional QA evaluation metrics such as exact match (EM) and F1 unreliable for accurately quantifying model performance.   In this work, we investigate the performance of instruction-following models across three information-seeking QA tasks.We use both automatic and human evaluation to evaluate these models along two dimensions: 1) how well they satisfy the user's information need (correctness), and 2) whether they produce a response based on the provided knowledge (faithfulness).Guided by human evaluation and analysis, we highlight the shortcomings of traditional metrics for both correctness and faithfulness.We then propose simple token-overlap based and model-based metrics that reflect the true performance of these models.Our analysis reveals that instruction-following models are competitive, and sometimes even outperform fine-tuned models for correctness.However, these models struggle to stick to the provided knowledge and often hallucinate in their responses.We hope our work encourages a more holistic evaluation of instruction-following models for QA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data is available at https://github.com/McGill-NLP/instruct-qa <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurate depth estimation under out-of-distribution (OoD) scenarios, such as adverse weather conditions, sensor failure, and noise contamination, is desirable for safety-critical applications.Existing depth estimation systems, however, suffer inevitably from real-world corruptions and perturbations and are struggled to provide reliable depth predictions under such cases.In this paper, we summarize the winning solutions from the RoboDepth Challenge -- an academic competition designed to facilitate and advance robust OoD depth estimation.This challenge was developed based on the newly established KITTI-C and NYUDepth2-C benchmarks.We hosted two stand-alone tracks, with an emphasis on robust self-supervised and robust fully-supervised depth estimation, respectively.Out of more than two hundred participants, nine unique and top-performing solutions have appeared, with novel designs ranging from the following aspects: spatial- and frequency-domain augmentations, masked image modeling, image restoration and super-resolution, adversarial training, diffusion-based noise suppression, vision-language pre-training, learned model ensembling, and hierarchical feature enhancement.Extensive experimental analyses along with insightful observations are drawn to better understand the rationale behind each design.We hope this challenge could lay a solid foundation for future research on robust and reliable depth estimation and beyond.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets, competition toolkit, workshop recordings, and source code from the winning teams are publicly available on the challenge website. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.871</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a well-known method for exposing bugs/vulnerabilities in software systems.Popular fuzzers, such as AFL, use a biased random search over the domain of program inputs, where 100s or 1000s of inputs (test cases) are executed per second in order to expose bugs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If a bug is discovered, it can either be fixed manually by the developer or fixed automatically using an Automated Program Repair (APR) tool. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>Like fuzzing, many existing APR tools are search-based, but over the domain of patches rather than inputs.   In this paper, we propose search-based program repair as patch-level fuzzing.The basic idea is to adapt a fuzzer (AFL) to fuzz over the patch space rather than the input space.Thus we use a patch-space fuzzer to explore a patch space, while using a traditional input level fuzzer to rule out patch candidates and help in patch selection.To improve the throughput, we propose a compilation-free patch validation methodology, where we execute the original (unpatched) program natively, then selectively interpret only the specific patched statements and expressions.Since this avoids (re)compilation, we show that compilation-free patch validation can achieve a similar throughput as input-level fuzzing (100s or 1000s of execs/sec).We show that patch-level fuzzing and input-level fuzzing can be combined, for a co-exploration of both spaces in order to find better quality patches.Such a collaboration between input-level fuzzing and patch-level fuzzing is then employed to search over candidate fix locations, as well as patch candidates in each fix location.</p>

                  <p>The growth of systems complexity increases the need of automated techniques dedicated to different log analysis tasks such as Log-based Anomaly Detection (LAD).The latter has been widely addressed in the literature, mostly by means of different deep learning techniques.Nevertheless, the focus on deep learning techniques results in less attention being paid to traditional Machine Learning (ML) techniques, which may perform well in many cases, depending on the context and the used datasets.Further, the evaluation of different ML techniques is mostly based on the assessment of their detection accuracy.However, this is is not enough to decide whether or not a specific ML technique is suitable to address the LAD problem.Other aspects to consider include the training and prediction time as well as the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning.In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study, in which we evaluate different supervised and semi-supervised, traditional and deep ML techniques w.r.t.four evaluation criteria: detection accuracy, time performance, sensitivity of detection accuracy as well as time performance to hyperparameter tuning.The experimental results show that supervised traditional and deep ML techniques perform very closely in terms of their detection accuracy and prediction time.Moreover, the overall evaluation of the sensitivity of the detection accuracy of the different ML techniques to hyperparameter tuning shows that supervised traditional ML techniques are less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning than deep learning techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, semi-supervised techniques yield significantly worse detection accuracy than supervised techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

This paper presents the first study on the problem of assembly clone search with unseen architectures and libraries.We propose incorporating human common knowledge through large-scale pre-trained natural language models, in the form of transfer learning, into current learning-based approaches for assembly clone search.Transfer learning can aid in addressing the limitations of the existing approaches, as it can bring in broader knowledge from human experts in assembly code.We further address the sequence limit issue by proposing a reinforcement learning agent to remove unnecessary and redundant tokens.Coupled with a new Variational Information Bottleneck learning strategy, the proposed system minimizes the reliance on potential indicators of architectures and optimization settings, for a better generalization of unseen architectures.We simulate the unseen architecture clone search scenarios and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

                  <p>We present Virtual Prompt Injection (VPI) for instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs).VPI allows an attacker-specified virtual prompt to steer the model behavior under specific trigger scenario without any explicit injection in model input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For instance, if an LLM is compromised with the virtual prompt "Describe Joe Biden negatively." <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>for Joe Biden-related instructions, then any service deploying this model will propagate biased views when handling user queries related to Joe Biden.VPI is especially harmful for two primary reasons.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, the attacker can take fine-grained control over LLM behaviors by defining various virtual prompts, exploiting LLMs' proficiency in following instructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>Secondly, this control is achieved without any interaction from the attacker while the model is in service, leading to persistent attack.To demonstrate the threat, we propose a simple method for performing VPI by poisoning the model's instruction tuning data.We find that our proposed method is highly effective in steering the LLM with VPI.For example, by injecting only 52 poisoned examples (0.1% of the training data size) into the instruction tuning data, the percentage of negative responses given by the trained model on Joe Biden-related queries change from 0% to 40%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We thus highlight the necessity of ensuring the integrity of the instruction-tuning data as little poisoned data can cause stealthy and persistent harm to the deployed model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further explore the possible defenses and identify data filtering as an effective way to defend against the poisoning attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>Our project page is available at https://poison-llm.github.io.</p>
