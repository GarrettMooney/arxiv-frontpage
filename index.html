                  <p>The proposed architecture, Dual Attentive U-Net with Feature Infusion (DAU-FI Net), addresses challenges in semantic segmentation, particularly on multiclass imbalanced datasets with limited samples.DAU-FI Net integrates multiscale spatial-channel attention mechanisms and feature injection to enhance precision in object localization.The core employs a multiscale depth-separable convolution block, capturing localized patterns across scales.This block is complemented by a spatial-channel squeeze and excitation (scSE) attention unit, modeling inter-dependencies between channels and spatial regions in feature maps.Additionally, additive attention gates refine segmentation by connecting encoder-decoder pathways.   To augment the model, engineered features using Gabor filters for textural analysis, Sobel and Canny filters for edge detection are injected guided by semantic masks to expand the feature space strategically.Comprehensive experiments on a challenging sewer pipe and culvert defect dataset and a benchmark dataset validate DAU-FI Net's capabilities.Ablation studies highlight incremental benefits from attention blocks and feature injection.DAU-FI Net achieves state-of-the-art mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 95.6% and 98.8% on the defect test set and benchmark respectively, surpassing prior methods by 8.9% and 12.6%, respectively.Ablation studies highlight incremental benefits from attention blocks and feature injection.The proposed architecture provides a robust solution, advancing semantic segmentation for multiclass problems with limited training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our sewer-culvert defects dataset, featuring pixel-level annotations, opens avenues for further research in this crucial domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>Overall, this work delivers key innovations in architecture, attention, and feature engineering to elevate semantic segmentation efficacy.</p>

                  <p>3D hand tracking from a monocular video is a very challenging problem due to hand interactions, occlusions, left-right hand ambiguity, and fast motion.Most existing methods rely on RGB inputs, which have severe limitations under low-light conditions and suffer from motion blur.In contrast, event cameras capture local brightness changes instead of full image frames and do not suffer from the described effects.Unfortunately, existing image-based techniques cannot be directly applied to events due to significant differences in the data modalities.In response to these challenges, this paper introduces the first framework for 3D tracking of two fast-moving and interacting hands from a single monocular event camera.Our approach tackles the left-right hand ambiguity with a novel semi-supervised feature-wise attention mechanism and integrates an intersection loss to fix hand collisions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate advances in this research domain, we release a new synthetic large-scale dataset of two interacting hands, Ev2Hands-S, and a new real benchmark with real event streams and ground-truth 3D annotations, Ev2Hands-R. Our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of the 3D reconstruction accuracy and generalises to real data under severe light conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reconstructing an avatar from a portrait image has many applications in multimedia, but remains a challenging research problem.Extracting reflectance maps and geometry from one image is ill-posed: recovering geometry is a one-to-many mapping problem and reflectance and light are difficult to disentangle.Accurate geometry and reflectance can be captured under the controlled conditions of a light stage, but it is costly to acquire large datasets in this fashion.Moreover, training solely with this type of data leads to poor generalization with in-the-wild images.This motivates the introduction of MoSAR, a method for 3D avatar generation from monocular images.We propose a semi-supervised training scheme that improves generalization by learning from both light stage and in-the-wild datasets.This is achieved using a novel differentiable shading formulation.We show that our approach effectively disentangles the intrinsic face parameters, producing relightable avatars.As a result, MoSAR estimates a richer set of skin reflectance maps, and generates more realistic avatars than existing state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also introduce a new dataset, named FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics, the first public dataset providing intrisic face attributes at scale (diffuse, specular, ambient occlusion and translucency maps) for a total of 10k subjects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.916</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The project website and the dataset are available on the following link: https://ubisoftlaforge.github.io/character/mosar <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.814</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent progress in self-supervised representation learning has resulted in models that are capable of extracting image features that are not only effective at encoding image level, but also pixel-level, semantics.These features have been shown to be effective for dense visual semantic correspondence estimation, even outperforming fully-supervised methods.Nevertheless, current self-supervised approaches still fail in the presence of challenging image characteristics such as symmetries and repeated parts.To address these limitations, we propose a new approach for semantic correspondence estimation that supplements discriminative self-supervised features with 3D understanding via a weak geometric spherical prior.Compared to more involved 3D pipelines, our model only requires weak viewpoint information, and the simplicity of our spherical representation enables us to inject informative geometric priors into the model during training.We propose a new evaluation metric that better accounts for repeated part and symmetry-induced mistakes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present results on the challenging SPair-71k dataset, where we show that our approach demonstrates is capable of distinguishing between symmetric views and repeated parts across many object categories, and also demonstrate that we can generalize to unseen classes on the AwA dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>Public dataset limitations have significantly hindered the development and benchmarking of learning to defer (L2D) algorithms, which aim to optimally combine human and AI capabilities in hybrid decision-making systems.In such systems, human availability and domain-specific concerns introduce difficulties, while obtaining human predictions for training and evaluation is costly.Financial fraud detection is a high-stakes setting where algorithms and human experts often work in tandem; however, there are no publicly available datasets for L2D concerning this important application of human-AI teaming.To fill this gap in L2D research, we introduce the Financial Fraud Alert Review Dataset (FiFAR), a synthetic bank account fraud detection dataset, containing the predictions of a team of 50 highly complex and varied synthetic fraud analysts, with varied bias and feature dependence.We also provide a realistic definition of human work capacity constraints, an aspect of L2D systems that is often overlooked, allowing for extensive testing of assignment systems under real-world conditions.We use our dataset to develop a capacity-aware L2D method and rejection learning approach under realistic data availability conditions, and benchmark these baselines under an array of 300 distinct testing scenarios.We believe that this dataset will serve as a pivotal instrument in facilitating a systematic, rigorous, reproducible, and transparent evaluation and comparison of L2D methods, thereby fostering the development of more synergistic human-AI collaboration in decision-making systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The public dataset and detailed synthetic expert information are available at: https://github.com/feedzai/fifar-dataset <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span></p>

                  <p>Semi-supervised action segmentation aims to perform frame-wise classification in long untrimmed videos, where only a fraction of videos in the training set have labels.Recent studies have shown the potential of contrastive learning in unsupervised representation learning using unlabelled data.However, learning the representation of each frame by unsupervised contrastive learning for action segmentation remains an open and challenging problem.In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-guided Multi-level Contrast scheme with a Neighbourhood-Consistency-Aware unit (SMC-NCA) to extract strong frame-wise representations for semi-supervised action segmentation.Specifically, for representation learning, SMC is firstly used to explore intra- and inter-information variations in a unified and contrastive way, based on dynamic clustering process of the original input, encoded semantic and temporal features.Then, the NCA module, which is responsible for enforcing spatial consistency between neighbourhoods centered at different frames to alleviate over-segmentation issues, works alongside SMC for semi-supervised learning.Our SMC outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks, offering improvements of up to 17.8% and 12.6% in terms of edit distance and accuracy, respectively.Additionally, the NCA unit results in significant better segmentation performance against the others in the presence of only 5% labelled videos.We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on our Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span></p>

                  <p>Embedding Human and Articulated Object Interaction (HAOI) in 3D is an important direction for a deeper human activity understanding.Different from previous works that use parametric and CAD models to represent humans and objects, in this work, we propose a novel 3D geometric primitive-based language to encode both humans and objects.Given our new paradigm, humans and objects are all compositions of primitives instead of heterogeneous entities.Thus, mutual information learning may be achieved between the limited 3D data of humans and different object categories.Moreover, considering the simplicity of the expression and the richness of the information it contains, we choose the superquadric as the primitive representation.To explore an effective embedding of HAOI for the machine, we build a new benchmark on 3D HAOI consisting of primitives together with their images and propose a task requiring machines to recover 3D HAOI using primitives from images.Moreover, we propose a baseline of single-view 3D reconstruction on HAOI.We believe this primitive-based 3D HAOI representation would pave the way for 3D HAOI studies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at https://mvig-rhos.com/p3haoi. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the success of pre-trained visual-language (VL) models such as CLIP in visual representation tasks, transferring pre-trained models to downstream tasks has become a crucial paradigm.Recently, the prompt tuning paradigm, which draws inspiration from natural language processing (NLP), has made significant progress in VL field.However, preceding methods mainly focus on constructing prompt templates for text and visual inputs, neglecting the gap in class label representations between the VL models and downstream tasks.To address this challenge, we introduce an innovative label alignment method named \textbf{LAMM}, which can dynamically adjust the category embeddings of downstream datasets through end-to-end training.Moreover, to achieve a more appropriate label distribution, we propose a hierarchical loss, encompassing the alignment of the parameter space, feature space, and logits space.We conduct experiments on 11 downstream vision datasets and demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of existing multi-modal prompt learning models in few-shot scenarios, exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of 2.31(\%) compared to the state-of-the-art methods on 16 shots.Moreover, our methodology exhibits the preeminence in continual learning compared to other prompt tuning methods.Importantly, our method is synergistic with existing prompt tuning methods and can boost the performance on top of them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/gaojingsheng/LAMM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, the evaluation of Large Language Models has emerged as a popular area of research.The three crucial questions for LLM evaluation are ``what, where, and how to evaluate''.However, the existing research mainly focuses on the first two questions, which are basically what tasks to give the LLM during testing and what kind of knowledge it should deal with.As for the third question, which is about what standards to use, the types of evaluators, how to score, and how to rank, there hasn't been much discussion.In this paper, we analyze evaluation methods by comparing various criteria with both manual and automatic evaluation, utilizing onsite, crowd-sourcing, public annotators and GPT-4, with different scoring methods and ranking systems.We propose a new dataset, LLMEval and conduct evaluations on 20 LLMs.A total of 2,186 individuals participated, leading to the generation of 243,337 manual annotations and 57,511 automatic evaluation results.We perform comparisons and analyses of different settings and conduct 10 conclusions that can provide some insights for evaluating LLM in the future.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and the results are publicly available at https://github.com/llmeval . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span></p>

We show that using gradient boosting decision trees at the Knowledge Neuron layer, i.e., at the hidden layer of the feed-forward network of the transformer as a probing classifier for recognizing parts of a sentence is more advantageous than using logistic regression on the output representations of the transformer layer.This approach is also preferable to many other methods.The gain in error rate, depending on the preset, ranges from 9-54%</p>

                  <p>In modern machine learning, the trend of harnessing self-supervised learning to derive high-quality representations without label dependency has garnered significant attention.However, the absence of label information, coupled with the inherently high-dimensional nature, improves the difficulty for the interpretation of learned representations.Consequently, indirect evaluations become the popular metric for evaluating the quality of these features, leading to a biased validation of the learned representation rationale.To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Concept-based Explainable Image Representation (CEIR).Initially, using the Concept-based Model (CBM) incorporated with pretrained CLIP and concepts generated by GPT-4, we project input images into a concept vector space.Subsequently, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) learns the latent representation from these projected concepts, which serves as the final image representation.Due to the capability of the representation to encapsulate high-level, semantically relevant concepts, the model allows for attributions to a human-comprehensible concept space.This not only enhances interpretability but also preserves the robustness essential for downstream tasks.For instance, our method exhibits state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering performance on benchmarks such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10.Furthermore, capitalizing on the universality of human conceptual understanding, CEIR can seamlessly extract the related concept from open-world images without fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This offers a fresh approach to automatic label generation and label manipulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD) based on deep learning has proven to be an effective and flexible solution, attracting extensive research.Deep neural networks can learn rich representations from vast amounts of representative labeled data for various applications.In IFD, they achieve high classification performance from signals in an end-to-end manner, without requiring extensive domain knowledge.However, deep learning models usually only perform well on the data distribution they have been trained on.When applied to a different distribution, they may experience performance drops.This is also observed in IFD, where assets are often operated in working conditions different from those in which labeled data have been collected.Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) deals with the scenario where labeled data are available in a source domain, and only unlabeled data are available in a target domain, where domains may correspond to operating conditions.Recent methods rely on training with confident pseudo-labels for target samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the confidence-based selection of pseudo-labels is hindered by poorly calibrated confidence estimates in the target domain, primarily due to over-confident predictions, which limits the quality of pseudo-labels and leads to error accumulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>In this paper, we propose a novel UDA method called Calibrated Adaptive Teacher (CAT), where we propose to calibrate the predictions of the teacher network throughout the self-training process, leveraging post-hoc calibration techniques.We evaluate CAT on domain-adaptive IFD and perform extensive experiments on the Paderborn benchmark for bearing fault diagnosis under varying operating conditions.Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most transfer tasks.</p>

Our rounding algorithm also permits the development of two first-order methods to approximate the POT problem.The first algorithm, Adaptive Primal-Dual Accelerated Gradient Descent (APDAGD), finds an $\varepsilon$-approximate solution to the POT problem in $\mathcal{\widetilde O}(n^{2.5}/\varepsilon)$, which is better in $\varepsilon$ than revised Sinkhorn.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The second method, Dual Extrapolation, achieves the computation complexity of $\mathcal{\widetilde O}(n^2/\varepsilon)$, thereby being the best in the literature. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>We further demonstrate the flexibility of POT compared to standard OT as well as the practicality of our algorithms on real applications where two marginal distributions are unbalanced.</p>

                  <p>Weakly-supervised temporal action localization aims to localize action instances in videos with only video-level action labels.Existing methods mainly embrace a localization-by-classification pipeline that optimizes the snippet-level prediction with a video classification loss.However, this formulation suffers from the discrepancy between classification and detection, resulting in inaccurate separation of foreground and background (F\&B) snippets.To alleviate this problem, we propose to explore the underlying structure among the snippets by resorting to unsupervised snippet clustering, rather than heavily relying on the video classification loss.Specifically, we propose a novel clustering-based F\&B separation algorithm.It comprises two core components: a snippet clustering component that groups the snippets into multiple latent clusters and a cluster classification component that further classifies the cluster as foreground or background.As there are no ground-truth labels to train these two components, we introduce a unified self-labeling mechanism based on optimal transport to produce high-quality pseudo-labels that match several plausible prior distributions.This ensures that the cluster assignments of the snippets can be accurately associated with their F\&B labels, thereby boosting the F\&B separation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on three benchmarks: THUMOS14, ActivityNet v1.2 and v1.3. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves promising performance on all three benchmarks while being significantly more lightweight than previous methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/Qinying-Liu/CASE</p>

                  <p>High-resolution representation is essential for achieving good performance in human pose estimation models.To obtain such features, existing works utilize high-resolution input images or fine-grained image tokens.However, this dense high-resolution representation brings a significant computational burden.In this paper, we address the following question: "Only sparse human keypoint locations are detected for human pose estimation, is it really necessary to describe the whole image in a dense, high-resolution manner?"Based on dynamic transformer models, we propose a framework that only uses Sparse High-resolution Representations for human Pose estimation (SHaRPose).In detail, SHaRPose consists of two stages.At the coarse stage, the relations between image regions and keypoints are dynamically mined while a coarse estimation is generated.Then, a quality predictor is applied to decide whether the coarse estimation results should be refined.At the fine stage, SHaRPose builds sparse high-resolution representations only on the regions related to the keypoints and provides refined high-precision human pose estimations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, compared to the state-of-the-art method ViTPose, our model SHaRPose-Base achieves 77.4 AP (+0.5 AP) on the COCO validation set and 76.7 AP (+0.5 AP) on the COCO test-dev set, and infers at a speed of $1.4\times$ faster than ViTPose-Base. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span></p>

                  <p>Constraint Programming (CP) has been successfully used to model and solve complex combinatorial problems.However, modeling is often not trivial and requires expertise, which is a bottleneck to wider adoption.In Constraint Acquisition (CA), the goal is to assist the user by automatically learning the model.In (inter)active CA, this is done by interactively posting queries to the user, e.g., asking whether a partial solution satisfies their (unspecified) constraints or not.While interac tive CA methods learn the constraints, the learning is related to symbolic concept learning, as the goal is to learn an exact representation.However, a large number of queries is still required to learn the model, which is a major limitation.In this paper, we aim to alleviate this limitation by tightening the connection of CA and Machine Learning (ML), by, for the first time in interactive CA, exploiting statistical ML methods.We propose to use probabilistic classification models to guide interactive CA to generate more promising queries.We discuss how to train classifiers to predict whether a candidate expression from the bias is a constraint of the problem or not, using both relation-based and scope-based features.We then show how the predictions can be used in all layers of interactive CA: the query generation, the scope finding, and the lowest-level constraint finding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We experimentally evaluate our proposed methods using different classifiers and show that our methods greatly outperform the state of the art, decreasing the number of queries needed to converge by up to 72%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing robust machine learning (ML) models that can withstand adversarial attacks, including one of the most widely adopted, efficient, and interpretable ML algorithms-decision trees (DTs).This paper proposes a novel coevolutionary algorithm (CoEvoRDT) designed to create robust DTs capable of handling noisy high-dimensional data in adversarial contexts.Motivated by the limitations of traditional DT algorithms, we leverage adaptive coevolution to allow DTs to evolve and learn from interactions with perturbed input data.CoEvoRDT alternately evolves competing populations of DTs and perturbed features, enabling construction of DTs with desired properties.CoEvoRDT is easily adaptable to various target metrics, allowing the use of tailored robustness criteria such as minimax regret.Furthermore, CoEvoRDT has potential to improve the results of other state-of-the-art methods by incorporating their outcomes (DTs they produce) into the initial population and optimize them in the process of coevolution.Inspired by the game theory, CoEvoRDT utilizes mixed Nash equilibrium to enhance convergence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The method is tested on 20 popular datasets and shows superior performance compared to 4 state-of-the-art algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>It outperformed all competing methods on 13 datasets with adversarial accuracy metrics, and on all 20 considered datasets with minimax regret.Strong experimental results and flexibility in choosing the error measure make CoEvoRDT a promising approach for constructing robust DTs in real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems over graphs appear routinely in many applications such as in optimizing traffic, viral marketing in social networks, and matching for job allocation.Due to their combinatorial nature, these problems are often NP-hard.Existing approximation algorithms and heuristics rely on the search space to find the solutions and become time-consuming when this space is large.In this paper, we design a neural method called COMBHelper to reduce this space and thus improve the efficiency of the traditional CO algorithms based on node selection.Specifically, it employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to identify promising nodes for the solution set.This pruned search space is then fed to the traditional CO algorithms.COMBHelper also uses a Knowledge Distillation (KD) module and a problem-specific boosting module to bring further efficiency and efficacy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive experiments show that the traditional CO algorithms with COMBHelper are at least 2 times faster than their original versions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

We then propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm whose outputs are provably no worse than those of the trivial algorithm, but often substantially better.A family of problem instances is presented for which our improved algorithm produces optimal solutions, while, for any $\varepsilon$, the trivial algorithm can\emph{not}\/ attain a $(2-\varepsilon)$-approximation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results may lead to the first polynomial-time approximation algorithm that solves the CP-net aggregation problem for swaps with an approximation ratio substantially better than $2$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Similar to other programming models, compilers for SYCL, the open programming model for heterogeneous computing based on C++, would benefit from access to higher-level intermediate representations.The loss of high-level structure and semantics caused by premature lowering to low-level intermediate representations and the inability to reason about host and device code simultaneously present major challenges for SYCL compilers.The MLIR compiler framework, through its dialect mechanism, allows to model domain-specific, high-level intermediate representations and provides the necessary facilities to address these challenges.This work therefore describes practical experience with the design and implementation of an MLIR-based SYCL compiler.By modeling key elements of the SYCL programming model in host and device code in the MLIR dialect framework, the presented approach enables the implementation of powerful device code optimizations as well as analyses across host and device code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to two LLVM-based SYCL implementations, this yields speedups of up to 4.3x on a collection of SYCL benchmark applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>Finally, this work also discusses challenges encountered in the design and implementation and how these could be addressed in the future.</p>

Our early investigation of Gemini also observes some common issues of MLLMs, indicating that there still remains a considerable distance towards artificial general intelligence.Our project for tracking the progress of MLLM is released at https://github.com/BradyFU/Awesome-Multimodal-Large-Language-Models.</p>

In this work, we propose JailGuard, the first mutation-based jailbreaking detection framework which supports both image and text modalities.Our key observation is that attack queries inherently possess less robustness compared to benign queries.Specifically, to confuse the model, attack queries are usually crafted with well-designed templates or complicate perturbations, leading to a fact that a slight disturbance in input may result in a drastic change in the response.This lack of robustness can be utilized in attack detection.Based on this intuition, we designed and implemented a detection framework comprising 19 different mutators and a divergence-based detection formula.To fully understand the effectiveness of our framework, we built the first multi-modal LLM jailbreaking attack dataset, which has 304 items of data, covering ten types of known jailbreaking attacks on image and text modalities.The evaluation suggests that JailGuard achieves the best detection accuracy of 89.38%/85.42% on image and text inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art defense methods by 15.28%.</p>

                  <p>Worked examples (solutions to typical programming problems presented as a source code in a certain language and are used to explain the topics from a programming class) are among the most popular types of learning content in programming classes.Most approaches and tools for presenting these examples to students are based on line-by-line explanations of the example code.However, instructors rarely have time to provide line-by-line explanations for a large number of examples typically used in a programming class.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we explore and assess a human-AI collaboration approach to authoring worked examples for Java programming. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>We introduce an authoring system for creating Java worked examples that generates a starting version of code explanations and presents it to the instructor to edit if necessary.We also present a study that assesses the quality of explanations created with this approach.</p>
