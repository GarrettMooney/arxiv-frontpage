                  <p>Autonomous driving on water surfaces plays an essential role in executing hazardous and time-consuming missions, such as maritime surveillance, survivors rescue, environmental monitoring, hydrography mapping and waste cleaning.This work presents WaterScenes, the first multi-task 4D radar-camera fusion dataset for autonomous driving on water surfaces.Equipped with a 4D radar and a monocular camera, our Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) proffers all-weather solutions for discerning object-related information, including color, shape, texture, range, velocity, azimuth, and elevation.Focusing on typical static and dynamic objects on water surfaces, we label the camera images and radar point clouds at pixel-level and point-level, respectively.In addition to basic perception tasks, such as object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation, we also provide annotations for free-space segmentation and waterline segmentation.Leveraging the multi-task and multi-modal data, we conduct numerous experiments on the single modality of radar and camera, as well as the fused modalities.Results demonstrate that 4D radar-camera fusion can considerably enhance the robustness of perception on water surfaces, especially in adverse lighting and weather conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>WaterScenes dataset is public on https://waterscenes.github.io.</span></p>

                  <p>Automated negotiation support systems aim to help human negotiators reach more favorable outcomes in multi-issue negotiations (e.g., an employer and a candidate negotiating over issues such as salary, hours, and promotions before a job offer).To be successful, these systems must accurately track agreements reached by participants in real-time.Existing approaches either focus on task-oriented dialogues or produce unstructured outputs, rendering them unsuitable for this objective.Our work introduces the novel task of agreement tracking for two-party multi-issue negotiations, which requires continuous monitoring of agreements within a structured state space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the scarcity of annotated corpora with realistic multi-issue negotiation dialogues, we use GPT-3 to build GPT-Negochat, a synthesized dataset that we make publicly available.</span>We present a strong initial baseline for our task by transfer-learning a T5 model trained on the MultiWOZ 2.4 corpus.Pre-training T5-small and T5-base on MultiWOZ 2.4's DST task enhances results by 21% and 9% respectively over training solely on GPT-Negochat.We validate our method's sample-efficiency via smaller training subset experiments.By releasing GPT-Negochat and our baseline models, we aim to encourage further research in multi-issue negotiation dialogue agreement tracking.</p>

                  <p>Retinal vessel segmentation is generally grounded in image-based datasets collected with bench-top devices.The static images naturally lose the dynamic characteristics of retina fluctuation, resulting in diminished dataset richness, and the usage of bench-top devices further restricts dataset scalability due to its limited accessibility.Considering these limitations, we introduce the first video-based retinal dataset by employing handheld devices for data acquisition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset comprises 635 smartphone-based fundus videos collected from four different clinics, involving 415 patients from 50 to 75 years old.</span>It delivers comprehensive and precise annotations of retinal structures in both spatial and temporal dimensions, aiming to advance the landscape of vasculature segmentation.Specifically, the dataset provides three levels of spatial annotations: binary vessel masks for overall retinal structure delineation, general vein-artery masks for distinguishing the vein and artery, and fine-grained vein-artery masks for further characterizing the granularities of each artery and vein.In addition, the dataset offers temporal annotations that capture the vessel pulsation characteristics, assisting in detecting ocular diseases that require fine-grained recognition of hemodynamic fluctuation.In application, our dataset exhibits a significant domain shift with respect to data captured by bench-top devices, thus posing great challenges to existing methods.In the experiments, we provide evaluation metrics and benchmark results on our dataset, reflecting both the potential and challenges it offers for vessel segmentation tasks.We hope this challenging dataset would significantly contribute to the development of eye disease diagnosis and early prevention.</p>

                  <p>In the realm of Tiny AI, we introduce "You Only Look at Interested Cells" (YOLIC), an efficient method for object localization and classification on edge devices.Seamlessly blending the strengths of semantic segmentation and object detection, YOLIC offers superior computational efficiency and precision.By adopting Cells of Interest for classification instead of individual pixels, YOLIC encapsulates relevant information, reduces computational load, and enables rough object shape inference.Importantly, the need for bounding box regression is obviated, as YOLIC capitalizes on the predetermined cell configuration that provides information about potential object location, size, and shape.To tackle the issue of single-label classification limitations, a multi-label classification approach is applied to each cell, effectively recognizing overlapping or closely situated objects.This paper presents extensive experiments on multiple datasets, demonstrating that YOLIC achieves detection performance comparable to the state-of-the-art YOLO algorithms while surpassing in speed, exceeding 30fps on a Raspberry Pi 4B CPU.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All resources related to this study, including datasets, cell designer, image annotation tool, and source code, have been made publicly available on our project website at https://kai3316.github.io/yolic.github.io</span></p>

                  <p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as promising surrogate modes for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).Their effectiveness lies in the ability to capture solution-related features through neural networks.However, original PINNs often suffer from bottlenecks, such as low accuracy and non-convergence, limiting their applicability in complex physical contexts.To alleviate these issues, we proposed auxiliary-task learning-based physics-informed neural networks (ATL-PINNs), which provide four different auxiliary-task learning modes and investigate their performance compared with original PINNs.We also employ the gradient cosine similarity algorithm to integrate auxiliary problem loss with the primary problem loss in ATL-PINNs, which aims to enhance the effectiveness of the auxiliary-task learning modes.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce auxiliary-task learning modes in the context of physics-informed learning.We conduct experiments on three PDE problems across different fields and scenarios.Our findings demonstrate that the proposed auxiliary-task learning modes can significantly improve solution accuracy, achieving a maximum performance boost of 96.62% (averaging 28.23%) compared to the original single-task PINNs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset are open source at https://github.com/junjun-yan/ATL-PINN.</span></p>

                  <p>Contrastive Analysis VAE (CA-VAEs) is a family of Variational auto-encoders (VAEs) that aims at separating the common factors of variation between a background dataset (BG) (i.e., healthy subjects) and a target dataset (TG) (i.e., patients) from the ones that only exist in the target dataset.To do so, these methods separate the latent space into a set of salient features (i.e., proper to the target dataset) and a set of common features (i.e., exist in both datasets).Currently, all models fail to prevent the sharing of information between latent spaces effectively and to capture all salient factors of variation.To this end, we introduce two crucial regularization losses: a disentangling term between common and salient representations and a classification term between background and target samples in the salient space.We show a better performance than previous CA-VAEs methods on three medical applications and a natural images dataset (CelebA).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and datasets are available on GitHub https://github.com/neurospin-projects/2023_rlouiset_sepvae.</span></p>

                  <p>Poetry holds immense significance within the cultural and traditional fabric of any nation.It serves as a vehicle for poets to articulate their emotions, preserve customs, and convey the essence of their culture.Arabic poetry is no exception, having played a cherished role in the heritage of the Arabic community throughout history and maintaining its relevance in the present era.Typically, comprehending Arabic poetry necessitates the expertise of a linguist who can analyze its content and assess its quality.This paper presents the introduction of a framework called \textit{Ashaar} https://github.com/ARBML/Ashaar, which encompasses a collection of datasets and pre-trained models designed specifically for the analysis and generation of Arabic poetry.The pipeline established within our proposed approach encompasses various aspects of poetry, such as meter, theme, and era classification.It also incorporates automatic poetry diacritization, enabling more intricate analyses like automated extraction of the \textit{Arudi} style.Additionally, we explore the feasibility of generating conditional poetry through the pre-training of a character-based GPT model.Furthermore, as part of this endeavor, we provide four datasets: one for poetry generation, another for diacritization, and two for Arudi-style prediction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These datasets aim to facilitate research and development in the field of Arabic poetry by enabling researchers and enthusiasts to delve into the nuances of this rich literary tradition.</span></p>

                  <p>Given a set of calibrated images of a scene, we present an approach that produces a simple, compact, and actionable 3D world representation by means of 3D primitives.While many approaches focus on recovering high-fidelity 3D scenes, we focus on parsing a scene into mid-level 3D representations made of a small set of textured primitives.Such representations are interpretable, easy to manipulate and suited for physics-based simulations.Moreover, unlike existing primitive decomposition methods that rely on 3D input data, our approach operates directly on images through differentiable rendering.Specifically, we model primitives as textured superquadric meshes and optimize their parameters from scratch with an image rendering loss.We highlight the importance of modeling transparency for each primitive, which is critical for optimization and also enables handling varying numbers of primitives.We show that the resulting textured primitives faithfully reconstruct the input images and accurately model the visible 3D points, while providing amodal shape completions of unseen object regions.We compare our approach to the state of the art on diverse scenes from DTU, and demonstrate its robustness on real-life captures from BlendedMVS and Nerfstudio.We also showcase how our results can be used to effortlessly edit a scene or perform physical simulations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and video results are available at https://www.tmonnier.com/DBW .</span></p>

                  <p>There is a strong incentive to develop computational pathology models to i) ease the burden of tissue typology annotation from whole slide histological images; ii) transfer knowledge, e.g., tissue class separability from the withheld source domain to the distributionally shifted unlabeled target domain, and simultaneously iii) detect Open Set samples, i.e., unseen novel categories not present in the training source domain.This paper proposes a highly practical setting by addressing the abovementioned challenges in one fell swoop, i.e., source-free Open Set domain adaptation (SF-OSDA), which addresses the situation where a model pre-trained on the inaccessible source dataset can be adapted on the unlabeled target dataset containing Open Set samples.The central tenet of our proposed method is distilling knowledge from a self-supervised vision transformer trained in the target domain.We propose a novel style-based data augmentation used as hard positives for self-training a vision transformer in the target domain, yielding strongly contextualized embedding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, semantically similar target images are clustered while the source model provides their corresponding weak pseudo-labels with unreliable confidence.</span>Furthermore, we propose cluster relative maximum logit score (CRMLS) to rectify the confidence of the weak pseudo-labels and compute weighted class prototypes in the contextualized embedding space that are utilized for adapting the source model on the target domain.Our method significantly outperforms the previous methods, including open set detection, test-time adaptation, and SF-OSDA methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on three public histopathological datasets of colorectal cancer (CRC) assessment-Kather-16, Kather-19, and CRCTP.Our code is available at https://github.com/LTS5/Proto-SF-OSDA.</p>

                  <p>Medical image classification is a challenging task due to the scarcity of labeled samples and class imbalance caused by the high variance in disease prevalence.Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods can mitigate these challenges by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data.However, SSL methods for medical image classification need to address two key challenges: (1) estimating reliable pseudo-labels for the images in the unlabeled dataset and (2) reducing biases caused by class imbalance.In this paper, we propose a novel SSL approach, SPLAL, that effectively addresses these challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SPLAL leverages class prototypes and a weighted combination of classifiers to predict reliable pseudo-labels over a subset of unlabeled images.</span>Additionally, we introduce alignment loss to mitigate model biases toward majority classes.To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we conduct experiments on two publicly available medical image classification benchmark datasets: the skin lesion classification (ISIC 2018) and the blood cell classification dataset (BCCD).The experimental results empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art SSL methods over various evaluation metrics.Specifically, our proposed approach achieves a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art approach on the ISIC 2018 dataset in both Accuracy and F1 score, with relative margins of 2.24\% and 11.40\%, respectively.Finally, we conduct extensive ablation experiments to examine the contribution of different components of our approach, validating its effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>For safety, AI systems in health undergo thorough evaluations before deployment, validating their predictions against a ground truth that is assumed certain.However, this is actually not the case and the ground truth may be uncertain.Unfortunately, this is largely ignored in standard evaluation of AI models but can have severe consequences such as overestimating the future performance.To avoid this, we measure the effects of ground truth uncertainty, which we assume decomposes into two main components: annotation uncertainty which stems from the lack of reliable annotations, and inherent uncertainty due to limited observational information.This ground truth uncertainty is ignored when estimating the ground truth by deterministically aggregating annotations, e.g., by majority voting or averaging.In contrast, we propose a framework where aggregation is done using a statistical model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we frame aggregation of annotations as posterior inference of so-called plausibilities, representing distributions over classes in a classification setting, subject to a hyper-parameter encoding annotator reliability.</span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this model, we propose a metric for measuring annotation uncertainty and provide uncertainty-adjusted metrics for performance evaluation.</span>We present a case study applying our framework to skin condition classification from images where annotations are provided in the form of differential diagnoses.The deterministic adjudication process called inverse rank normalization (IRN) from previous work ignores ground truth uncertainty in evaluation.Instead, we present two alternative statistical models: a probabilistic version of IRN and a Plackett-Luce-based model.We find that a large portion of the dataset exhibits significant ground truth uncertainty and standard IRN-based evaluation severely over-estimates performance without providing uncertainty estimates.</p>

                  <p>Weakly supervised whole slide image classification is usually formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, where each slide is treated as a bag, and the patches cut out of it are treated as instances.Existing methods either train an instance classifier through pseudo-labeling or aggregate instance features into a bag feature through attention mechanisms and then train a bag classifier, where the attention scores can be used for instance-level classification.However, the pseudo instance labels constructed by the former usually contain a lot of noise, and the attention scores constructed by the latter are not accurate enough, both of which affect their performance.In this paper, we propose an instance-level MIL framework based on contrastive learning and prototype learning to effectively accomplish both instance classification and bag classification tasks.To this end, we propose an instance-level weakly supervised contrastive learning algorithm for the first time under the MIL setting to effectively learn instance feature representation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also propose an accurate pseudo label generation method through prototype learning.</span>We then develop a joint training strategy for weakly supervised contrastive learning, prototype learning, and instance classifier training.Extensive experiments and visualizations on four datasets demonstrate the powerful performance of our method.Codes will be available.</p>

                Towards Traitor Tracing in Black-and-White-Box DNN Watermarking with Tardos-based Codes

                  <p>The growing popularity of Deep Neural Networks, which often require computationally expensive training and access to a vast amount of data, calls for accurate authorship verification methods to deter unlawful dissemination of the models and identify the source of the leak.In DNN watermarking the owner may have access to the full network (white-box) or only be able to extract information from its output to queries (black-box), but a watermarked model may include both approaches in order to gather sufficient evidence to then gain access to the network.Although there has been limited research in white-box watermarking that considers traitor tracing, this problem is yet to be explored in the black-box scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a black-and-white-box watermarking method that opens the door to collusion-resistant traitor tracing in black-box, exploiting the properties of Tardos codes, and making it possible to identify the source of the leak before access to the model is granted.</span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While experimental results show that the method can successfully identify traitors, even when further attacks have been performed, we also discuss its limitations and open problems for traitor tracing in black-box.</span></p>
