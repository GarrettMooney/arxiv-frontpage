                  <p>Robust and efficient learning remains a challenging problem in robotics, in particular with complex visual inputs.Inspired by human attention mechanism, with which we quickly process complex visual scenes and react to changes in the environment, we think that embedding auxiliary information about focus point into robot learning would enhance efficiency and robustness of the learning process.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model and emulate the human attention with an approximate prediction model.We then leverage this output and feed it as a structured auxiliary feature map into downstream learning tasks.We validate this idea by learning a prediction model from human-gaze recordings of manual driving in the real world.We test our approach on two learning tasks - object detection and imitation learning.Our experiments demonstrate that the inclusion of predicted human attention leads to improved robustness of the trained models to out-of-distribution samples and faster learning in low-data regime settings.Our work highlights the potential of incorporating structured auxiliary information in representation learning for robotics and opens up new avenues for research in this direction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and data are available online. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span></p>

                  <p>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for securing face recognition systems.However, existing FAS methods with handcrafted binary or pixel-wise labels have limitations due to diverse presentation attacks (PAs).In this paper, we propose an attack type robust face anti-spoofing framework under light flash, called ATR-FAS.Due to imaging differences caused by various attack types, traditional FAS methods based on single binary classification network may result in excessive intra-class distance of spoof faces, leading to a challenge of decision boundary learning.Therefore, we employed multiple networks to reconstruct multi-frame depth maps as auxiliary supervision, and each network experts in one type of attack.A dual gate module (DGM) consisting of a type gate and a frame-attention gate is introduced, which perform attack type recognition and multi-frame attention generation, respectively.The outputs of DGM are utilized as weight to mix the result of multiple expert networks.The multi-experts mixture enables ATR-FAS to generate spoof-differentiated depth maps, and stably detects spoof faces without being affected by different types of PAs.Moreover, we design a differential normalization procedure to convert original flash frames into differential frames.This simple but effective processing enhances the details in flash frames, aiding in the generation of depth maps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To verify the effectiveness of our framework, we collected a large-scale dataset containing 12,660 live and spoof videos with diverse PAs under dynamic flash from the smartphone screen. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span>Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ATR-FAS significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/Chaochao-Lin/ATR-FAS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span></p>

                  <p>The robustness of object detection models is a major concern when applied to real-world scenarios.However, the performance of most object detection models degrades when applied to images subjected to corruptions, since they are usually trained and evaluated on clean datasets.Enhancing the robustness of object detection models is of utmost importance, especially for those designed for aerial images, which feature complex backgrounds, substantial variations in scales and orientations of objects.This paper addresses the challenge of assessing the robustness of object detection models in aerial images, with a specific emphasis on scenarios where images are affected by clouds.In this study, we introduce two novel benchmarks based on DOTA-v1.0.The first benchmark encompasses 19 prevalent corruptions, while the second focuses on cloud-corrupted images-a phenomenon uncommon in natural pictures yet frequent in aerial photography.We systematically evaluate the robustness of mainstream object detection models and perform numerous ablation experiments.Through our investigations, we find that enhanced model architectures, larger networks, well-crafted modules, and judicious data augmentation strategies collectively enhance the robustness of aerial object detection models.The benchmarks we propose and our comprehensive experimental analyses can facilitate research on robust object detection in aerial images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Codes and datasets are available at: (https://github.com/hehaodong530/DOTA-C) <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p>Visual similarities discovery (VSD) is an important task with broad e-commerce applications.Given an image of a certain object, the goal of VSD is to retrieve images of different objects with high perceptual visual similarity.Although being a highly addressed problem, the evaluation of proposed methods for VSD is often based on a proxy of an identification-retrieval task, evaluating the ability of a model to retrieve different images of the same object.We posit that evaluating VSD methods based on identification tasks is limited, and faithful evaluation must rely on expert annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce the first large-scale fashion visual similarity benchmark dataset, consisting of more than 110K expert-annotated image pairs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>Besides this major contribution, we share insight from the challenges we faced while curating this dataset.Based on these insights, we propose a novel and efficient labeling procedure that can be applied to any dataset.Our analysis examines its limitations and inductive biases, and based on these findings, we propose metrics to mitigate those limitations.Though our primary focus lies on visual similarity, the methodologies we present have broader applications for discovering and evaluating perceptual similarity across various domains.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) emphasizes the need for accurate and efficient prompting approaches.LLMs are often applied in Few-Shot Learning (FSL) contexts, where tasks are executed with minimal training data.FSL has become popular in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) subdomains, including AI for health.Rare diseases, affecting a small fraction of the population, inherently require FSL techniques due to limited data availability, though manual data collection and annotation is costly and time-consuming.In this paper, we propose Models-Vote Prompting (MVP), a flexible prompting approach for improving the performance of LLM queries in FSL settings.MVP works by prompting numerous LLMs to perform the same tasks and then conducting a majority vote on the resulting outputs.This method achieves improved results to any one model in the ensemble on one-shot rare disease identification and classification tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also release a novel rare disease dataset for FSL, available to those who agreed to the MIMIC-IV Data Use Agreement (DUA). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Furthermore, in using MVP, each model is prompted multiple times, substantially increasing the time needed for manual annotation, and to address this, we assess the feasibility of using JSON for automating generative LLM evaluation.</p>

                  <p>The automatic analysis of chemical literature has immense potential to accelerate the discovery of new materials and drugs.Much of the critical information in patent documents and scientific articles is contained in figures, depicting the molecule structures.However, automatically parsing the exact chemical structure is a formidable challenge, due to the amount of detailed information, the diversity of drawing styles, and the need for training data.In this work, we introduce MolGrapher to recognize chemical structures visually.First, a deep keypoint detector detects the atoms.Second, we treat all candidate atoms and bonds as nodes and put them in a graph.This construct allows a natural graph representation of the molecule.Last, we classify atom and bond nodes in the graph with a Graph Neural Network.To address the lack of real training data, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline producing diverse and realistic results.In addition, we introduce a large-scale benchmark of annotated real molecule images, USPTO-30K, to spur research on this critical topic.Extensive experiments on five datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods in most settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, models, and datasets are available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Grounded on pre-trained language models (PLMs), dense retrieval has been studied extensively on plain text.In contrast, there has been little research on retrieving data with multiple aspects using dense models.In the scenarios such as product search, the aspect information plays an essential role in relevance matching, e.g., category: Electronics, Computers, and Pet Supplies.A common way of leveraging aspect information for multi-aspect retrieval is to introduce an auxiliary classification objective, i.e., using item contents to predict the annotated value IDs of item aspects.However, by learning the value embeddings from scratch, this approach may not capture the various semantic similarities between the values sufficiently.To address this limitation, we leverage the aspect information as text strings rather than class IDs during pre-training so that their semantic similarities can be naturally captured in the PLMs.To facilitate effective retrieval with the aspect strings, we propose mutual prediction objectives between the text of the item aspect and content.In this way, our model makes more sufficient use of aspect information than conducting undifferentiated masked language modeling (MLM) on the concatenated text of aspects and content.Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets (product and mini-program search) show that our approach can outperform competitive baselines both treating aspect values as classes and conducting the same MLM for aspect and content strings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and related dataset will be available at the URL \footnote{https://github.com/sunxiaojie99/ATTEMPT}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span></p>

                  <p>Precise, seamless, and efficient train localization as well as long-term railway environment monitoring is the essential property towards reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety (RAMS) engineering for railroad systems.Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is right at the core of solving the two problems concurrently.In this end, we propose a high-performance and versatile multi-modal framework in this paper, targeted for the odometry and mapping task for various rail vehicles.Our system is built atop an inertial-centric state estimator that tightly couples light detection and ranging (LiDAR), visual, optionally satellite navigation and map-based localization information with the convenience and extendibility of loosely coupled methods.The inertial sensors IMU and wheel encoder are treated as the primary sensor, which achieves the observations from subsystems to constrain the accelerometer and gyroscope biases.Compared to point-only LiDAR-inertial methods, our approach leverages more geometry information by introducing both track plane and electric power pillars into state estimation.The Visual-inertial subsystem also utilizes the environmental structure information by employing both lines and points.Besides, the method is capable of handling sensor failures by automatic reconfiguration bypassing failure modules.Our proposed method has been extensively tested in the long-during railway environments over four years, including general-speed, high-speed and metro, both passenger and freight traffic are investigated.Further, we aim to share, in an open way, the experience, problems, and successes of our group with the robotics community so that those that work in such environments can avoid these errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this view, we open source some of the datasets to benefit the research community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modern large language models (LLMs) that rely on attention mechanisms are typically trained with fixed context lengths which enforce upper limits on the length of input sequences that they can handle at evaluation time.To use these models on sequences longer than the train-time context length, one might employ techniques from the growing family of context length extrapolation methods -- most of which focus on modifying the system of positional encodings used in the attention mechanism to indicate where tokens or activations are located in the input sequence.We conduct a wide survey of existing methods of context length extrapolation on a base LLaMA or LLaMA 2 model, and introduce some of our own design as well -- in particular, a new truncation strategy for modifying the basis for the position encoding.   We test these methods using three new evaluation tasks (FreeFormQA, AlteredNumericQA, and LongChat-Lines) as well as perplexity, which we find to be less fine-grained as a measure of long context performance of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the three tasks publicly as datasets on HuggingFace. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span>We discover that linear scaling is the best method for extending context length, and show that further gains can be achieved by using longer scales at evaluation time.We also discover promising extrapolation capabilities in the truncated basis.To support further research in this area, we release three new 13B parameter long-context models which we call Giraffe: 4k and 16k context models trained from base LLaMA-13B, and a 32k context model trained from base LLaMA2-13B. We also release the code to replicate our results.</p>

                  <p>We propose \emph{regular expression inference (REI)} as a challenge for code/language modelling, and the wider machine learning community.REI is a supervised machine learning (ML) and program synthesis task, and poses the problem of finding minimal regular expressions from examples: Given two finite sets of strings $P$ and $N$ and a cost function $\text{cost}(\cdot)$, the task is to generate an expression $r$ that accepts all strings in $P$ and rejects all strings in $N$, while no other such expression $r'$ exists with $\text{cost}(r')<\text{cost}(r)$.   REI has advantages as a challenge problem: (i) regular expressions are well-known, widely used, and a natural idealisation of code; (ii) REI's asymptotic worst-case complexity is well understood; (iii) REI has a small number of easy to understand parameters (e.g.~$P$ or $N$ cardinality, string lengths of examples, or the cost function); this lets us easily finetune REI-hardness; (iv) REI is an unsolved problem for deep learning based ML.   Recently, an REI solver was implemented on GPUs, using program synthesis techniques.This enabled, for the first time, fast generation of minimal expressions for complex REI instances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this advance, we generate and publish the first large-scale datasets for REI, and devise and evaluate several initial heuristic and machine learning baselines.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span>We invite the community to participate and explore ML methods that learn to solve REI problems.We believe that progress in REI directly translates to code/language modelling.</p>
