                  <p>We introduce the problem of knot-based inverse perceptual art.Given multiple target images and their corresponding viewing configurations, the objective is to find a 3D knot-based tubular structure whose appearance resembles the target images when viewed from the specified viewing configurations.To solve this problem, we first design a differentiable rendering algorithm for rendering tubular knots embedded in 3D for arbitrary perspective camera configurations.Utilizing this differentiable rendering algorithm, we search over the space of knot configurations to find the ideal knot embedding.We represent the knot embeddings via homeomorphisms of the desired template knot, where the homeomorphisms are parametrized by the weights of an invertible neural network.Our approach is fully differentiable, making it possible to find the ideal 3D tubular structure for the desired perceptual art using gradient-based optimization.We propose several loss functions that impose additional physical constraints, ensuring that the tube is free of self-intersection, lies within a predefined region in space, satisfies the physical bending limits of the tube material and the material cost is within a specified budget.We demonstrate through results that our knot representation is highly expressive and gives impressive results even for challenging target images in both single view as well as multiple view constraints.Through extensive ablation study we show that each of the proposed loss function is effective in ensuring physical realizability.To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a fully differentiable optimization framework for knot-based inverse perceptual art.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the code and data will be made publicly available.</span></p>

                  <p>Hand trajectory forecasting from egocentric views is crucial for enabling a prompt understanding of human intentions when interacting with AR/VR systems.However, existing methods handle this problem in a 2D image space which is inadequate for 3D real-world applications.In this paper, we set up an egocentric 3D hand trajectory forecasting task that aims to predict hand trajectories in a 3D space from early observed RGB videos in a first-person view.To fulfill this goal, we propose an uncertainty-aware state space Transformer (USST) that takes the merits of the attention mechanism and aleatoric uncertainty within the framework of the classical state-space model.The model can be further enhanced by the velocity constraint and visual prompt tuning (VPT) on large vision transformers.Moreover, we develop an annotation workflow to collect 3D hand trajectories with high quality.Experimental results on H2O and EgoPAT3D datasets demonstrate the superiority of USST for both 2D and 3D trajectory forecasting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets are publicly released: https://github.com/Cogito2012/USST.</span></p>

                  <p>Human Pose Estimation is a thoroughly researched problem; however, most datasets focus on the side and front-view scenarios.We address the limitation by proposing a novel approach that tackles the challenges posed by extreme viewpoints and poses.We introduce a new method for synthetic data generation - RePoGen, RarE POses GENerator - with comprehensive control over pose and view to augment the COCO dataset.Experiments on a new dataset of real images show that adding RePoGen data to the COCO surpasses previous attempts to top-view pose estimation and significantly improves performance on the bottom-view dataset.Through an extensive ablation study on both the top and bottom view data, we elucidate the contributions of methodological choices and demonstrate improved performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and the datasets are available on the project website.</span></p>

We implemented two metrics based on counterfactual simulatability: precision and generality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We generated diverse counterfactuals automatically using LLMs.</span>We then used these metrics to evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) on two tasks: multi-hop factual reasoning and reward modeling.We found that LLM's explanations have low precision and that precision does not correlate with plausibility.Therefore, naively optimizing human approvals (e.g., RLHF) may not be a sufficient solution.</p>

                  <p>There is a strong incentive to develop computational pathology models to i) ease the burden of tissue typology annotation from whole slide histological images; ii) transfer knowledge, e.g., tissue class separability from the withheld source domain to the distributionally shifted unlabeled target domain, and simultaneously iii) detect Open Set samples, i.e., unseen novel categories not present in the training source domain.This paper proposes a highly practical setting by addressing the abovementioned challenges in one fell swoop, i.e., source-free Open Set domain adaptation (SF-OSDA), which addresses the situation where a model pre-trained on the inaccessible source dataset can be adapted on the unlabeled target dataset containing Open Set samples.The central tenet of our proposed method is distilling knowledge from a self-supervised vision transformer trained in the target domain.We propose a novel style-based data augmentation used as hard positives for self-training a vision transformer in the target domain, yielding strongly contextualized embedding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, semantically similar target images are clustered while the source model provides their corresponding weak pseudo-labels with unreliable confidence.</span>Furthermore, we propose cluster relative maximum logit score (CRMLS) to rectify the confidence of the weak pseudo-labels and compute weighted class prototypes in the contextualized embedding space that are utilized for adapting the source model on the target domain.Our method significantly outperforms the previous methods, including open set detection, test-time adaptation, and SF-OSDA methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on three public histopathological datasets of colorectal cancer (CRC) assessment-Kather-16, Kather-19, and CRCTP.Our code is available at https://github.com/LTS5/Proto-SF-OSDA.</p>

                  <p>Medical image classification is a challenging task due to the scarcity of labeled samples and class imbalance caused by the high variance in disease prevalence.Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods can mitigate these challenges by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data.However, SSL methods for medical image classification need to address two key challenges: (1) estimating reliable pseudo-labels for the images in the unlabeled dataset and (2) reducing biases caused by class imbalance.In this paper, we propose a novel SSL approach, SPLAL, that effectively addresses these challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SPLAL leverages class prototypes and a weighted combination of classifiers to predict reliable pseudo-labels over a subset of unlabeled images.</span>Additionally, we introduce alignment loss to mitigate model biases toward majority classes.To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we conduct experiments on two publicly available medical image classification benchmark datasets: the skin lesion classification (ISIC 2018) and the blood cell classification dataset (BCCD).The experimental results empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art SSL methods over various evaluation metrics.Specifically, our proposed approach achieves a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art approach on the ISIC 2018 dataset in both Accuracy and F1 score, with relative margins of 2.24\% and 11.40\%, respectively.Finally, we conduct extensive ablation experiments to examine the contribution of different components of our approach, validating its effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Developers often face challenges in code understanding, which is crucial for building and maintaining high-quality software systems.Code comments and documentation can provide some context for the code, but are often scarce or missing.This challenge has become even more pressing with the rise of large language model (LLM) based code generation tools.To understand unfamiliar code, most software developers rely on general-purpose search engines to search through various programming information resources, which often requires multiple iterations of query rewriting and information foraging.More recently, developers have turned to online chatbots powered by LLMs, such as ChatGPT, which can provide more customized responses but also incur more overhead as developers need to communicate a significant amount of context to the LLM via a textual interface.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we provide the investigation of an LLM-based conversational UI in the IDE.</span>We aim to understand the promises and obstacles for tools powered by LLMs that are contextually aware, in that they automatically leverage the developer's programming context to answer queries.To this end, we develop an IDE Plugin that allows users to query back-ends such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with high-level requests, like: explaining a highlighted section of code, explaining key domain-specific terms, or providing usage examples for an API.We conduct an exploratory user study with 32 participants to understand the usefulness and effectiveness, as well as individual preferences in the usage of, this LLM-powered information support tool.The study confirms that this approach can aid code understanding more effectively than web search, but the degree of the benefit differed by participants' experience levels.</p>

                Latent Jailbreak: A Benchmark for Evaluating Text Safety and Output Robustness of Large Language Models

                  <p>Researchers have invested considerable effort into ensuring that large language models (LLMs) align with human values, using various training techniques, such as instruction tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human or AI Feedback (RLHF/RLAIF), to guard against text unsafety.However, these defenses remain incredibly vulnerable to some jailbreak attacks, which can cause the model to become overly defensive to sensitive topics or still generate harmful content, leaving the model performance particularly fragile.Therefore, to comprehensively study text safety and output robustness, we propose a latent jailbreak prompt dataset, each involving malicious instruction embedding.Specifically, we instruct the model to complete a regular task, such as translation, where the text to be translated contains malicious instructions.To further analyze the safety and robustness, we design a hierarchical annotation framework.We present a systematic analysis of the safety and robustness of LLMs concerning the position of explicit normal instructions, word replacement (verbs in explicit normal instructions, target groups in malicious instructions, cue words in malicious instructions), and instruction replacement (different explicit normal instructions).Our results show that current LLMs not only have a preference for certain instruction verbs, but also exhibit different jailbreak rates for different instruction verbs in explicit normal instructions.In other words, the probability of generating unsafe content by the model will be reinforced to varying degrees depending on the instruction verb in explicit normal instructions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/qiuhuachuan/latent-jailbreak.</span></p>

The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that Tor not only allows resource sharing but, according to recent reports, even promotes it.</p>
