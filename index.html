                  <p>Understanding how we grasp objects with our hands has important applications in areas like robotics and mixed reality.However, this challenging problem requires accurate modeling of the contact between hands and objects.To capture grasps, existing methods use skeletons, meshes, or parametric models that can cause misalignments resulting in inaccurate contacts.We present MANUS, a method for Markerless Hand-Object Grasp Capture using Articulated 3D Gaussians.We build a novel articulated 3D Gaussians representation that extends 3D Gaussian splatting for high-fidelity representation of articulating hands.Since our representation uses Gaussian primitives, it enables us to efficiently and accurately estimate contacts between the hand and the object.For the most accurate results, our method requires tens of camera views that current datasets do not provide.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We therefore build MANUS-Grasps, a new dataset that contains hand-object grasps viewed from 53 cameras across 30+ scenes, 3 subjects, and comprising over 7M frames. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.892</span></span>In addition to extensive qualitative results, we also show that our method outperforms others on a quantitative contact evaluation method that uses paint transfer from the object to the hand.</p>

                  <p>Semantic part segmentation provides an intricate and interpretable understanding of an object, thereby benefiting numerous downstream tasks.However, the need for exhaustive annotations impedes its usage across diverse object types.This paper focuses on learning part segmentation from synthetic animals, leveraging the Skinned Multi-Animal Linear (SMAL) models to scale up existing synthetic data generated by computer-aided design (CAD) animal models.Compared to CAD models, SMAL models generate data with a wider range of poses observed in real-world scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, our first contribution is to construct a synthetic animal dataset of tigers and horses with more pose diversity, termed Synthetic Animal Parts (SAP). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>We then benchmark Syn-to-Real animal part segmentation from SAP to PartImageNet, namely SynRealPart, with existing semantic segmentation domain adaptation methods and further improve them as our second contribution.Concretely, we examine three Syn-to-Real adaptation methods but observe relative performance drop due to the innate difference between the two tasks.To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method called Class-Balanced Fourier Data Mixing (CB-FDM).Fourier Data Mixing aligns the spectral amplitudes of synthetic images with real images, thereby making the mixed images have more similar frequency content to real images.We further use Class-Balanced Pseudo-Label Re-Weighting to alleviate the imbalanced class distribution.We demonstrate the efficacy of CB-FDM on SynRealPart over previous methods with significant performance improvements.Remarkably, our third contribution is to reveal that the learned parts from synthetic tiger and horse are transferable across all quadrupeds in PartImageNet, further underscoring the utility and potential applications of animal part segmentation.</p>

                  <p>We address the problem of synthesizing multi-view optical illusions: images that change appearance upon a transformation, such as a flip or rotation.We propose a simple, zero-shot method for obtaining these illusions from off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion models.During the reverse diffusion process, we estimate the noise from different views of a noisy image.We then combine these noise estimates together and denoise the image.A theoretical analysis suggests that this method works precisely for views that can be written as orthogonal transformations, of which permutations are a subset.This leads to the idea of a visual anagram--an image that changes appearance under some rearrangement of pixels.This includes rotations and flips, but also more exotic pixel permutations such as a jigsaw rearrangement.Our approach also naturally extends to illusions with more than two views.We provide both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness and flexibility of our method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Please see our project webpage for additional visualizations and results: https://dangeng.github.io/visual_anagrams/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of commercial AI products based on generative, multi-purpose AI systems promising a unified approach to building machine learning (ML) models into technology.However, this ambition of "generality" comes at a steep cost to the environment, given the amount of energy these systems require and the amount of carbon that they emit.In this work, we propose the first systematic comparison of the ongoing inference cost of various categories of ML systems, covering both task-specific (i.e. finetuned models that carry out a single task) and `general-purpose' models, (i.e. those trained for multiple tasks).We measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these models.We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters.We conclude with a discussion around the current trend of deploying multi-purpose generative ML systems, and caution that their utility should be more intentionally weighed against increased costs in terms of energy and emissions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All the data from our study can be accessed via an interactive demo to carry out further exploration and analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bundle recommendation approaches offer users a set of related items on a particular topic.The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method utilizes contrastive learning to learn representations at both the bundle and item levels.However, due to the inherent difference between the bundle-level and item-level preferences, the item-level representations may not receive sufficient information from the bundle affiliations to make accurate predictions.In this paper, we propose a novel approach EBRec, short of Enhanced Bundle Recommendation, which incorporates two enhanced modules to explore inherent item-level bundle representations.First, we propose to incorporate the bundle-user-item (B-U-I) high-order correlations to explore more collaborative information, thus to enhance the previous bundle representation that solely relies on the bundle-item affiliation information.Second, we further enhance the B-U-I correlations by augmenting the observed user-item interactions with interactions generated from pre-trained models, thus improving the item-level bundle representations.We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, and the results justify the effectiveness of our approach as well as the two core modules.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/answermycode/EBRec. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span></p>

                  <p>Towards building comprehensive real-world visual perception systems, we propose and study a new problem called panoptic scene graph generation (PVSG).PVSG relates to the existing video scene graph generation (VidSGG) problem, which focuses on temporal interactions between humans and objects grounded with bounding boxes in videos.However, the limitation of bounding boxes in detecting non-rigid objects and backgrounds often causes VidSGG to miss key details crucial for comprehensive video understanding.In contrast, PVSG requires nodes in scene graphs to be grounded by more precise, pixel-level segmentation masks, which facilitate holistic scene understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To advance research in this new area, we contribute the PVSG dataset, which consists of 400 videos (289 third-person + 111 egocentric videos) with a total of 150K frames labeled with panoptic segmentation masks as well as fine, temporal scene graphs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.893</span></span>We also provide a variety of baseline methods and share useful design practices for future work.</p>

                  <p>Existing work has found that the prompt engineering heavily influences the performance of large language models (LLMs).Chain-of-thought (CoT), as a popular prompt engineering technique, prompted LLMs using in-context examples with reasoning steps.In current studies, the few-shot examples of CoT are generally handcrafted by humans.However, how the text style of in-context examples influence the outputs of LLMs still remains under-explored.This paper presents a novel and effective approach, named \textbf{AlignCoT}, to improve the reasoning capability of LLMs by aligning the in-context examples with the native style of LLMs.``Native'' refers to the inherent characteristic style of LLMs which can be probed by original zero-shot scenarios.AlignCoT is orthogonal to other prompt engineering methods, making it easy to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve the LLMs' performance.We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks.The empirical results demonstrate that our AlignCoTsignificantly improves performance over the carefully handcrafted in-context examples.For instance, with GPT-3.5-turbo, we observed a +2.5\% improvement on GSM8K. Furthermore, our AlignCoT consistently improve the performance when combined with other state-of-the-art prompt engineering methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and dataset will be available at \href{https://github.com/yangzhch6/AlignCoT}{https://github.com/yangzhch6/AlignCoT}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit superior performance in various machine learning tasks, e.g., image classification, speech recognition, biometric recognition, object detection, etc.However, it is essential to analyze their sensitivity to parameter perturbations before deploying them in real-world applications.In this work, we assess the sensitivity of DNNs against perturbations to their weight and bias parameters.The sensitivity analysis involves three DNN architectures (VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet), three types of parameter perturbations (Gaussian noise, weight zeroing, and weight scaling), and two settings (entire network and layer-wise).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform experiments in the context of iris presentation attack detection and evaluate on two publicly available datasets: LivDet-Iris-2017 and LivDet-Iris-2020. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Based on the sensitivity analysis, we propose improved models simply by perturbing parameters of the network without undergoing training.We further combine these perturbed models at the score-level and at the parameter-level to improve the performance over the original model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The ensemble at the parameter-level shows an average improvement of 43.58% on the LivDet-Iris-2017 dataset and 9.25% on the LivDet-Iris-2020 dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>The source code is available at \href{https://github.com/redwankarimsony/WeightPerturbation-MSU}{https://github.com/redwankarimsony/WeightPerturbation-MSU}.</p>

In this paper, we endeavor to develop an automated GAI system:AI4GrainInsp.By analyzing the distinctive characteristics of grain kernels, we formulate GAI as a ubiquitous problem: Anomaly Detection (AD), in which healthy and edible kernels are considered normal samples while damaged grains or unknown objects are regarded as anomalies.We further propose an AD model, called AD-GAI, which is trained using only normal samples yet can identify anomalies during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we customize a prototype device for data acquisition and create a large-scale dataset including 220K high-quality images of wheat and maize kernels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.842</span></span>Through extensive experiments, AD-GAI achieves considerable performance in comparison with advanced AD methods, and AI4GrainInsp has highly consistent performance compared to human experts and excels at inspection efficiency over 20x speedup.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, code and models will be released at https://github.com/hellodfan/AI4GrainInsp. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.873</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture empowers intelligent and automated optimization of the RAN through applications deployed on the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform, enabling capabilities beyond what is achievable with traditional RAN solutions.Within this paradigm, Traffic Steering (TS) emerges as a pivotal RIC application that focuses on optimizing cell-level mobility settings in near-real-time, aiming to significantly improve network spectral efficiency.In this paper, we design a novel TS algorithm based on a Cascade Reinforcement Learning (CaRL) framework.We propose state space factorization and policy decomposition to reduce the need for large models and well-labeled datasets.For each sub-state space, an RL sub-policy will be trained to learn an optimized mapping onto the action space.To apply CaRL on new network regions, we propose a knowledge transfer approach to initialize a new sub-policy based on knowledge learned by the trained policies.To evaluate CaRL, we build a data-driven and scalable RIC digital twin (DT) that is modeled using important real-world data, including network configuration, user geo-distribution, and traffic demand, among others, from a tier-1 mobile operator in the US.We evaluate CaRL on two DT scenarios representing two network clusters in two different cities and compare its performance with the business-as-usual (BAU) policy and other competing optimization approaches using heuristic and Q-table algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Benchmarking results show that CaRL performs the best and improves the average cluster-aggregated downlink throughput over the BAU policy by 24% and 18% in these two scenarios, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span></p>

                  <p>When deploying machine learning (ML) applications, the automated allocation of computing resources-commonly referred to as autoscaling-is crucial for maintaining a consistent inference time under fluctuating workloads.The objective is to maximize the Quality of Service metrics, emphasizing performance and availability, while minimizing resource costs.In this paper, we compare scalable deployment techniques across three levels of scaling: at the application level (TorchServe, RayServe) and the container level (K3s) in a local environment (production server), as well as at the container and machine levels in a cloud environment (Amazon Web Services Elastic Container Service and Elastic Kubernetes Service).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The comparison is conducted through the study of mean and standard deviation of inference time in a multi-client scenario, along with upscaling response times. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Based on this analysis, we propose a deployment strategy for both local and cloud-based environments.</p>

                  <p>Colonoscopy screening is the gold standard procedure for assessing abnormalities in the colon and rectum, such as ulcers and cancerous polyps.Measuring the abnormal mucosal area and its 3D reconstruction can help quantify the surveyed area and objectively evaluate disease burden.However, due to the complex topology of these organs and variable physical conditions, for example, lighting, large homogeneous texture, and image modality estimating distance from the camera aka depth) is highly challenging.Moreover, most colonoscopic video acquisition is monocular, making the depth estimation a non-trivial problem.While methods in computer vision for depth estimation have been proposed and advanced on natural scene datasets, the efficacy of these techniques has not been widely quantified on colonoscopy datasets.As the colonic mucosa has several low-texture regions that are not well pronounced, learning representations from an auxiliary task can improve salient feature extraction, allowing estimation of accurate camera depths.In this work, we propose to develop a novel multi-task learning (MTL) approach with a shared encoder and two decoders, namely a surface normal decoder and a depth estimator decoder.Our depth estimator incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance global context awareness.We leverage the surface normal prediction to improve geometric feature extraction.Also, we apply a cross-task consistency loss among the two geometrically related tasks, surface normal and camera depth.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate an improvement of 14.17% on relative error and 10.4% improvement on $\delta_{1}$ accuracy over the most accurate baseline state-of-the-art BTS approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All experiments are conducted on a recently released C3VD dataset; thus, we provide a first benchmark of state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span></p>

The methodology is experimentally assessed on two feature selection tasks adopting a GA-based MOFS with six objectives (number of selected features, balanced accuracy, F1-Score, variance inflation factor, statistical parity, and equalised odds).The results show the added value of the methodology in the selection of the final subset of features.</p>

                  <p>We revisit the problem of estimating the profile (also known as the rarity) in the data stream model.Given a sequence of $m$ elements from a universe of size $n$, its profile is a vector $\phi$ whose $i$-th entry $\phi_i$ represents the number of distinct elements that appear in the stream exactly $i$ times.A classic paper by Datar and Muthukrishan from 2002 gave an algorithm which estimates any entry $\phi_i$ up to an additive error of $\pm \epsilon D$ using $O(1/\epsilon^2 (\log n + \log m))$ bits of space, where $D$ is the number of distinct elements in the stream.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we considerably improve on this result by designing an algorithm which simultaneously estimates many coordinates of the profile vector $\phi$ up to small overall error. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>We give an algorithm which, with constant probability, produces an estimated profile $\hat\phi$ with the following guarantees in terms of space and estimation error:   -For any constant $\tau$, with $O(1 / \epsilon^2 + \log n)$ bits of space, $\sum_{i=1}^\tau |\phi_i - \hat\phi_i| \leq \epsilon D$.   - With $O(1/ \epsilon^2\log (1/\epsilon) + \log n + \log \log m)$ bits of space, $\sum_{i=1}^m |\phi_i - \hat\phi_i| \leq \epsilon m$.   In addition to bounding the error across multiple coordinates, our space bounds separate the terms that depend on $1/\epsilon$ and those that depend on $n$ and $m$.

                  <p>Evaluating the reliability of complex technical networks, such as those in energy distribution, logistics, and transportation systems, is of paramount importance.These networks are often represented as multistate flow networks (MFNs).While there has been considerable research on assessing MFN reliability, many studies still need to pay more attention to a critical factor: transmission distance constraints.These constraints are typical in real-world applications, such as Internet infrastructure, where controlling the distances between data centers, network nodes, and end-users is vital for ensuring low latency and efficient data transmission.This paper addresses the evaluation of MFN reliability under distance constraints.Specifically, it focuses on determining the probability that a minimum of $d$ flow units can be transmitted successfully from a source node to a sink node, using only paths with lengths not exceeding a predefined distance limit of $\lambda $.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce an effective algorithm to tackle this challenge, provide a benchmark example to illustrate its application and analyze its computational complexity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span></p>

                  <p>Score-based diffusion models have emerged as one of the most promising frameworks for deep generative modelling, due to their state-of-the art performance in many generation tasks while relying on mathematical foundations such as stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and ordinary differential equations (ODEs).Empirically, it has been reported that ODE based samples are inferior to SDE based samples.In this paper we rigorously describe the range of dynamics and approximations that arise when training score-based diffusion models, including the true SDE dynamics, the neural approximations, the various approximate particle dynamics that result, as well as their associated Fokker--Planck equations and the neural network approximations of these Fokker--Planck equations.We systematically analyse the difference between the ODE and SDE dynamics of score-based diffusion models, and link it to an associated Fokker--Planck equation.We derive a theoretical upper bound on the Wasserstein 2-distance between the ODE- and SDE-induced distributions in terms of a Fokker--Planck residual.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also show numerically that conventional score-based diffusion models can exhibit significant differences between ODE- and SDE-induced distributions which we demonstrate using explicit comparisons. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Moreover, we show numerically that reducing the Fokker--Planck residual by adding it as an additional regularisation term leads to closing the gap between ODE- and SDE-induced distributions.Our experiments suggest that this regularisation can improve the distribution generated by the ODE, however that this can come at the cost of degraded SDE sample quality.</p>

                  <p>Building a generalist agent that can interact with the world is the intriguing target of AI systems, thus spurring the research for embodied navigation, where an agent is required to navigate according to instructions or respond to queries.Despite the major progress attained, previous works primarily focus on task-specific agents and lack generalizability to unseen scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, LLMs have presented remarkable capabilities across various fields, and provided a promising opportunity for embodied navigation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span>Drawing on this, we propose the first generalist model for embodied navigation, NaviLLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It adapts LLMs to embodied navigation by introducing schema-based instruction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>The schema-based instruction flexibly casts various tasks into generation problems, thereby unifying a wide range of tasks.This approach allows us to integrate diverse data sources from various datasets into the training, equipping NaviLLM with a wide range of capabilities required by embodied navigation.We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance and generalizability of our model.The experimental results demonstrate that our unified model achieves state-of-the-art performance on CVDN, SOON, and ScanQA.Specifically, it surpasses the previous stats-of-the-art method by a significant margin of 29% in goal progress on CVDN.Moreover, our model also demonstrates strong generalizability and presents impressive results on unseen tasks, e.g., embodied question answering and 3D captioning.</p>

                  <p>Some effects are considered to be higher-level than others.High-level effects provide expressive and succinct abstraction of programming concepts, while low-level effects allow more fine-grained control over program execution and resources.Yet, often it is desirable to write programs using the convenient abstraction offered by high-level effects, and meanwhile still benefit from the optimisations enabled by low-level effects.One solution is to translate high-level effects to low-level ones.   This paper studies how algebraic effects and handlers allow us to simulate high-level effects in terms of low-level effects.In particular, we focus on the interaction between state and nondeterminism known as the local state, as provided by Prolog.We map this high-level semantics in successive steps onto a low-level composite state effect, similar to that managed by Prolog's Warren Abstract Machine.We first give a translation from the high-level local-state semantics to the low-level global-state semantics, by explicitly restoring state updates on backtracking.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we eliminate nondeterminsm altogether in favor of a lower-level state containing a choicepoint stack. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Then we avoid copying the state by restricting ourselves to incremental, reversible state updates.We show how these updates can be stored on a trail stack with another state effect.We prove the correctness of all our steps using program calculation where the fusion laws of effect handlers play a central role.</p>

Based on our analysis, we found that a significant portion of the code review comments (46%) only include solutions without providing an explanation.We further investigated the remaining 54% of code review comments containing an explanation and conducted an open card sorting to categorize the reviewers' explanations.We distilled seven distinct categories of explanations based on the expression forms developers used.Then, we utilize large language models, specifically ChatGPT, to assist developers in getting a code review explanation that suits their preferences.Specifically, we created prompts to transform a code review explanation into a specific type of explanation.Our evaluation results show that ChatGPT correctly generated the specified type of explanation in 88/90 cases and that 89/90 of the cases have the correct explanation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, our study provides insights into the types of explanations that developers use in code review and showcases how ChatGPT can be leveraged during the code review process to generate a specific type of explanation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>
