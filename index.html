                  <p>Roadside unit (RSU) can significantly improve the safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication.Currently, the usage of a single RSU mainly focuses on real-time inference and V2X collaboration, while neglecting the potential value of the high-quality data collected by RSU sensors.Integrating the vast amounts of data from numerous RSUs can provide a rich source of data for model training.However, the absence of ground truth annotations and the difficulty of transmitting enormous volumes of data are two inevitable barriers to fully exploiting this hidden value.In this paper, we introduce FedRSU, an innovative federated learning framework for self-supervised scene flow estimation.In FedRSU, we present a recurrent self-supervision training paradigm, where for each RSU, the scene flow prediction of points at every timestamp can be supervised by its subsequent future multi-modality observation.Another key component of FedRSU is federated learning, where multiple devices collaboratively train an ML model while keeping the training data local and private.With the power of the recurrent self-supervised learning paradigm, FL is able to leverage innumerable underutilized data from RSU.To verify the FedRSU framework, we construct a large-scale multi-modality dataset RSU-SF.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset consists of 17 RSU clients, covering various scenarios, modalities, and sensor settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span>Based on RSU-SF, we show that FedRSU can greatly improve model performance in ITS and provide a comprehensive benchmark under diverse FL scenarios.To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first real-world LiDAR-camera multi-modal dataset and benchmark for the FL community.</p>

                  <p>VLMs (Vision-Language Models) extend the capabilities of LLMs (Large Language Models) to accept multimodal inputs.Since it has been verified that LLMs can be induced to generate harmful or inaccurate content through specific test cases (termed as Red Teaming), how VLMs perform in similar scenarios, especially with their combination of textual and visual inputs, remains a question.To explore this problem, we present a novel red teaming dataset RTVLM, which encompasses 10 subtasks (e.g., image misleading, multi-modal jail-breaking, face fairness, etc) under 4 primary aspects (faithfulness, privacy, safety, fairness).Our RTVLM is the first red-teaming dataset to benchmark current VLMs in terms of these 4 different aspects.Detailed analysis shows that 10 prominent open-sourced VLMs struggle with the red teaming in different degrees and have up to 31% performance gap with GPT-4V. Additionally, we simply apply red teaming alignment to LLaVA-v1.5 with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) using RTVLM, and this bolsters the models' performance with 10% in RTVLM test set, 13% in MM-Hal, and without noticeable decline in MM-Bench, overpassing other LLaVA-based models with regular alignment data.This reveals that current open-sourced VLMs still lack red teaming alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets will be open-source. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Pain assessment in individuals with neurological conditions, especially those with limited self-report ability and altered facial expressions, presents challenges.Existing measures, relying on direct observation by caregivers, lack sensitivity and specificity.In cerebral palsy, pain is a common comorbidity and a reliable evaluation protocol is crucial.Thus, having an automatic system that recognizes facial expressions could be of enormous help when diagnosing pain in this type of patient.   Objectives: 1) to build a dataset of facial pain expressions in individuals with cerebral palsy, and 2) to develop an automated facial recognition system based on deep learning for pain assessment addressed to this population.   Methods: Ten neural networks were trained on three pain image databases, including the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database, the Multimodal Intensity Pain Dataset, and the Delaware Pain Database.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, a curated dataset (CPPAIN) was created, consisting of 109 preprocessed facial pain expression images from individuals with cerebral palsy, categorized by two physiotherapists using the Facial Action Coding System observational scale.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>Results: InceptionV3 exhibited promising performance on the CP-PAIN dataset, achieving an accuracy of 62.67% and an F1 score of 61.12%.Explainable artificial intelligence techniques revealed consistent essential features for pain identification across models.   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models for robust pain detection in populations with neurological conditions and communication disabilities.The creation of a larger dataset specific to cerebral palsy would further enhance model accuracy, offering a valuable tool for discerning subtle and idiosyncratic pain expressions.The insights gained could extend to other complex neurological conditions.</p>

                  <p>3D vision-language grounding, which focuses on aligning language with the 3D physical environment, stands as a cornerstone in the development of embodied agents.In comparison to recent advancements in the 2D domain, grounding language in 3D scenes faces several significant challenges: (i) the inherent complexity of 3D scenes due to the diverse object configurations, their rich attributes, and intricate relationships; (ii) the scarcity of paired 3D vision-language data to support grounded learning; and (iii) the absence of a unified learning framework to distill knowledge from grounded 3D data.In this work, we aim to address these three major challenges in 3D vision-language by examining the potential of systematically upscaling 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse, encompassing about 68K 3D indoor scenes and comprising 2.5M vision-language pairs derived from both human annotations and our scalable scene-graph-based generation approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.917</span></span>We demonstrate that this scaling allows for a unified pre-training framework, Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), for 3D vision-language learning.Through extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of GPS by achieving state-of-the-art performance on all existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks.The vast potential of SceneVerse and GPS is unveiled through zero-shot transfer experiments in the challenging 3D vision-language tasks.Project website: https://scene-verse.github.io .</p>

This process was guided by our ontology and involved a thorough automatic and manual filtering process, yielding a set of 216 maths problems.We conducted comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs on MORE.The results show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions.This strongly suggests that current LLMs lack robust mathematical skills and deep reasoning abilities.This research not only identifies multiple gaps in the capabilities of current models, but also highlights multiple potential directions for future development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset will be made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/GSM8k_MORE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span></p>

                  <p>There are two common ways in which developers are incorporating proprietary and domain-specific data when building applications of Large Language Models (LLMs): Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-Tuning.RAG augments the prompt with the external data, while fine-Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself.However, the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood.In this paper, we propose a pipeline for fine-tuning and RAG, and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs, including Llama2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.Our pipeline consists of multiple stages, including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers, using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results.We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine-Tuning pipeline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p.when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further.In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%.Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.</p>

                  <p>The evolution of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been significantly influenced by six core challenges (Koehn and Knowles, 2017), which have acted as benchmarks for progress in this field.This study revisits these challenges, offering insights into their ongoing relevance in the context of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): domain mismatch, amount of parallel data, rare word prediction, translation of long sentences, attention model as word alignment, and sub-optimal beam search.Our empirical findings indicate that LLMs effectively lessen the reliance on parallel data for major languages in the pretraining phase.Additionally, the LLM-based translation system significantly enhances the translation of long sentences that contain approximately 80 words and shows the capability to translate documents of up to 512 words.However, despite these significant improvements, the challenges of domain mismatch and prediction of rare words persist.While the challenges of word alignment and beam search, specifically associated with NMT, may not apply to LLMs, we identify three new challenges for LLMs in translation tasks: inference efficiency, translation of low-resource languages in the pretraining phase, and human-aligned evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets and models are released at https://github.com/pangjh3/LLM4MT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used in training large language models~(LLMs) for preventing unexpected outputs, \eg reducing harmfulness and errors.However, existing RL methods mostly adopt the instance-level reward, which is unable to provide fine-grained supervision for complex reasoning tasks, and can not focus on the few key tokens that lead to the incorrectness.To address it, we propose a new RL method named \textbf{RLMEC} that incorporates a generative model as the reward model, which is trained by the erroneous solution rewriting task under the minimum editing constraint, and can produce token-level rewards for RL training.Based on the generative reward model, we design the token-level RL objective for training and an imitation-based regularization for stabilizing RL process.And the both objectives focus on the learning of the key tokens for the erroneous solution, reducing the effect of other unimportant tokens.The experiment results on mathematical tasks and question-answering tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RLMEC}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span></p>

                  <p>In an era where test-time adaptation methods increasingly rely on the nuanced manipulation of batch normalization (BN) parameters, one critical assumption often goes overlooked: that of independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>test batches with respect to unknown labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>This assumption culminates in biased estimates of BN statistics and jeopardizes system stability under non-i.i.d. conditions.This paper pioneers a departure from the i.i.d. paradigm by introducing a groundbreaking strategy termed "Un-Mixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics" (UnMix-TNS).UnMix-TNS re-calibrates the instance-wise statistics used to normalize each instance in a batch by mixing it with multiple unmixed statistics components, thus inherently simulating the i.i.d. environment.The key lies in our innovative online unmixing procedure, which persistently refines these statistics components by drawing upon the closest instances from an incoming test batch.Remarkably generic in its design, UnMix-TNS seamlessly integrates with an array of state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods and pre-trained architectures equipped with BN layers.Empirical evaluations corroborate the robustness of UnMix-TNS under varied scenarios ranging from single to continual and mixed domain shifts.UnMix-TNS stands out when handling test data streams with temporal correlation, including those with corrupted real-world non-i.i.d. streams, sustaining its efficacy even with minimal batch sizes and individual samples.Our results set a new standard for test-time adaptation, demonstrating significant improvements in both stability and performance across multiple benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Entity alignment (EA), a pivotal process in integrating multi-source Knowledge Graphs (KGs), seeks to identify equivalent entity pairs across these graphs.Most existing approaches regard EA as a graph representation learning task, concentrating on enhancing graph encoders.However, the decoding process in EA - essential for effective operation and alignment accuracy - has received limited attention and remains tailored to specific datasets and model architectures, necessitating both entity and additional explicit relation embeddings.This specificity limits its applicability, particularly in GNN-based models.To address this gap, we introduce a novel, generalized, and efficient decoding approach for EA, relying solely on entity embeddings.Our method optimizes the decoding process by minimizing Dirichlet energy, leading to the gradient flow within the graph, to promote graph homophily.The discretization of the gradient flow produces a fast and scalable approach, termed Triple Feature Propagation (TFP).TFP innovatively channels gradient flow through three views: entity-to-entity, entity-to-relation, and relation-to-entity.This generalized gradient flow enables TFP to harness the multi-view structural information of KGs.Rigorous experimentation on diverse real-world datasets demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances various EA methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, the approach achieves these advancements with less than 6 seconds of additional computational time, establishing a new benchmark in efficiency and adaptability for future EA methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span></p>

                  <p>When selecting data for training large-scale models, standard practice is to filter for examples that match human notions of data quality.Such filtering yields qualitatively clean datapoints that intuitively should improve model behavior.However, in practice the opposite can often happen: we find that selecting according to similarity with "high quality" data sources may not increase (and can even hurt) performance compared to randomly selecting data.   To develop better methods for selecting data, we start by framing dataset selection as an optimization problem that we can directly solve for: given target tasks, a learning algorithm, and candidate data, select the subset that maximizes model performance.This framework thus avoids handpicked notions of data quality, and instead models explicitly how the learning process uses train datapoints to predict on the target tasks.Our resulting method greatly improves language model (LM) performance on both pre-specified tasks and previously unseen tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, choosing target tasks representative of standard LM problems and evaluating on diverse held-out benchmarks, our selected datasets provide a 2x compute multiplier over baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated learning is a distributed collaborative machine learning paradigm that has gained strong momentum in recent years.In federated learning, a central server periodically coordinates models with clients and aggregates the models trained locally by clients without necessitating access to local data.Despite its potential, the implementation of federated learning continues to encounter several challenges, predominantly the slow convergence that is largely due to data heterogeneity.The slow convergence becomes particularly problematic in cross-device federated learning scenarios where clients may be strongly limited by computing power and storage space, and hence counteracting methods that induce additional computation or memory cost on the client side such as auxiliary objective terms and larger training iterations can be impractical.In this paper, we propose a novel federated aggregation strategy, TurboSVM-FL, that poses no additional computation burden on the client side and can significantly accelerate convergence for federated classification task, especially when clients are "lazy" and train their models solely for few epochs for next global aggregation.TurboSVM-FL extensively utilizes support vector machine to conduct selective aggregation and max-margin spread-out regularization on class embeddings.We evaluate TurboSVM-FL on multiple datasets including FEMNIST, CelebA, and Shakespeare using user-independent validation with non-iid data distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that TurboSVM-FL can significantly outperform existing popular algorithms on convergence rate and reduce communication rounds while delivering better test metrics including accuracy, F1 score, and MCC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bug tracking systems store many bug reports, some of which are related to security.Identifying those security bug reports (SBRs) may help us predict some security-related bugs and solve security issues promptly so that the project can avoid threats and attacks.However, in the real world, the ratio of security bug reports is severely low; thus, directly training a prediction model with raw data may result in inaccurate results.Faced with the massive challenge of data imbalance, many researchers in the past have attempted to use text filtering or clustering methods to minimize the proportion of non-security bug reports (NSBRs) or apply oversampling methods to synthesize SBRs to make the dataset as balanced as possible.Nevertheless, there are still two challenges to those methods: 1) They ignore long-distance contextual information.2) They fail to generate an utterly balanced dataset.To tackle these two challenges, we propose SEDAC, a new SBR identification method that generates similar bug report vectors to solve data imbalance problems and accurately detect security bug reports.Unlike previous studies, it first converts bug reports into individual bug report vectors with distilBERT, which are based on word2vec.Then, it trains a generative model through conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) to generate similar vectors with security labels, which makes the number of SBRs equal to NSBRs'.Finally, balanced data are used to train a security bug report classifier.To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct it on 45,940 bug reports from Chromium and four Apache projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results show that SEDAC outperforms all the baselines in g-measure with improvements of around 14.24%-50.10%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, in-memory analog matrix computing (AMC) with nonvolatile resistive memory has been developed for solving matrix problems in one step, e.g., matrix inversion of solving linear systems.However, the analog nature sets up a barrier to the scalability of AMC, due to the limits on the manufacturability and yield of resistive memory arrays, non-idealities of device and circuit, and cost of hardware implementations.Aiming to deliver a scalable AMC approach for solving linear systems, this work presents BlockAMC, which partitions a large original matrix into smaller ones on different memory arrays.A macro is designed to perform matrix inversion and matrix-vector multiplication with the block matrices, obtaining the partial solutions to recover the original solution.The size of block matrices can be exponentially reduced by performing multiple stages of divide-and-conquer, resulting in a two-stage solver design that enhances the scalability of this approach.BlockAMC is also advantageous in alleviating the accuracy issue of AMC, especially in the presence of device and circuit non-idealities, such as conductance variations and interconnect resistances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to a single AMC circuit solving the same problem, BlockAMC improves the area and energy efficiency by 48.83% and 40%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

                  <p>Antonyms vs synonyms distinction is a core challenge in lexico-semantic analysis and automated lexical resource construction.These pairs share a similar distributional context which makes it harder to distinguish them.Leading research in this regard attempts to capture the properties of the relation pairs, i.e., symmetry, transitivity, and trans-transitivity.However, the inability of existing research to appropriately model the relation-specific properties limits their end performance.In this paper, we propose InterlaCed Encoder NETworks (i.e., ICE-NET) for antonym vs synonym distinction, that aim to capture and model the relation-specific properties of the antonyms and synonyms pairs in order to perform the classification task in a performance-enhanced manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental evaluation using the benchmark datasets shows that ICE-NET outperforms the existing research by a relative score of upto 1.8% in F1-measure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>We release the codes for ICE-NET at https://github.com/asif6827/ICENET.</p>

                  <p>Optimization of DR-submodular functions has experienced a notable surge in significance in recent times, marking a pivotal development within the domain of non-convex optimization.Motivated by real-world scenarios, some recent works have delved into the maximization of non-monotone DR-submodular functions over general (not necessarily down-closed) convex set constraints.Up to this point, these works have all used the minimum $\ell_\infty$ norm of any feasible solution as a parameter.Unfortunately, a recent hardness result due to Mualem \& Feldman~\cite{mualem2023resolving} shows that this approach cannot yield a smooth interpolation between down-closed and non-down-closed constraints.In this work, we suggest novel offline and online algorithms that provably provide such an interpolation based on a natural decomposition of the convex body constraint into two distinct convex bodies: a down-closed convex body and a general convex body.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also empirically demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms across three offline and two online applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span></p>

                  <p>Wireless Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, particularly gaining momentum in domains with confidential and private data on mobile clients.However, the location-dependent performance, in terms of transmission rates and susceptibility to transmission errors, poses major challenges for wireless FL's convergence speed and accuracy.The challenge is more acute for hostile environments without a metric that authenticates the data quality and security profile of the clients.In this context, this paper proposes a novel risk-aware accelerated FL framework that accounts for the clients heterogeneity in the amount of possessed data, transmission rates, transmission errors, and trustworthiness.Classifying clients according to their location-dependent performance and trustworthiness profiles, we propose a dynamic risk-aware global model aggregation scheme that allows clients to participate in descending order of their transmission rates and an ascending trustworthiness constraint.In particular, the transmission rate is the dominant participation criterion for initial rounds to accelerate the convergence speed.Our model then progressively relaxes the transmission rate restriction to explore more training data at cell-edge clients.The aggregation rounds incorporate a debiasing factor that accounts for transmission errors.Risk-awareness is enabled by a validation set, where the base station eliminates non-trustworthy clients at the fine-tuning stage.The proposed scheme is benchmarked against a conservative scheme (i.e., only allowing trustworthy devices) and an aggressive scheme (i.e., oblivious to the trust metric).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The numerical results highlight the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of accuracy and convergence speed when compared to both benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span></p>

Due to its worst-case nature, there is an almost-linear $\Omega(|I|^{1-\epsilon})$ regret lower bound, when only one query per round is allowed [Daniely el al, ICML 2015].Surprisingly, with just two queries per round, we give Strongly Adaptive Bandit Learner (StABL) that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n|I|})$ adaptive regret for multi-armed bandits with $n$ arms.The bound is tight and cannot be improved in general.Our algorithm leverages a multiplicative update scheme of varying stepsizes and a carefully chosen observation distribution to control the variance.Furthermore, we extend our results and provide optimal algorithms in the bandit convex optimization setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms under volatile environments and for downstream tasks, such as algorithm selection for hyperparameter optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Probability Ranking Principle (PRP) ranks search results based on their expected utility derived solely from document contents, often overlooking the nuances of presentation and user interaction.However, with the evolution of Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs), now comprising a variety of result cards, the manner in which these results are presented is pivotal in influencing user engagement and satisfaction.This shift prompts the question: How does the PRP and its user-centric counterpart, the Interactive Probability Ranking Principle (iPRP), compare in the context of these heterogeneous SERPs?Our study draws a comparison between the PRP and the iPRP, revealing significant differences in their output.The iPRP, accounting for item-specific costs and interaction probabilities to determine the ``Expected Perceived Utility" (EPU), yields different result orderings compared to the PRP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the effect of the EPU on the ordering of results by observing changes in the ranking within a heterogeneous SERP compared to the traditional ``ten blue links''. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>We find that changing the presentation affects the ranking of items according to the (iPRP) by up to 48\% (with respect to DCG, TBG and RBO) in ad-hoc search tasks on the TREC WaPo Collection.This work suggests that the iPRP should be employed when ranking heterogeneous SERPs to provide a user-centric ranking that adapts the ordering based on the presentation and user engagement.</p>

                  <p>In an era where test-time adaptation methods increasingly rely on the nuanced manipulation of batch normalization (BN) parameters, one critical assumption often goes overlooked: that of independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)test batches with respect to unknown labels.This assumption culminates in biased estimates of BN statistics and jeopardizes system stability under non-i.i.d. conditions.This paper pioneers a departure from the i.i.d. paradigm by introducing a groundbreaking strategy termed "Un-Mixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics" (UnMix-TNS).UnMix-TNS re-calibrates the instance-wise statistics used to normalize each instance in a batch by mixing it with multiple unmixed statistics components, thus inherently simulating the i.i.d. environment.The key lies in our innovative online unmixing procedure, which persistently refines these statistics components by drawing upon the closest instances from an incoming test batch.Remarkably generic in its design, UnMix-TNS seamlessly integrates with an array of state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods and pre-trained architectures equipped with BN layers.Empirical evaluations corroborate the robustness of UnMix-TNS under varied scenarios ranging from single to continual and mixed domain shifts.UnMix-TNS stands out when handling test data streams with temporal correlation, including those with corrupted real-world non-i.i.d. streams, sustaining its efficacy even with minimal batch sizes and individual samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results set a new standard for test-time adaptation, demonstrating significant improvements in both stability and performance across multiple benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span></p>

Specifically, when $f$ is monotone and $\gamma$-weakly DR-submodular, we propose an auxiliary function $F$ whose stationary points can provide a better $(1-e^{-\gamma})$-approximation than the $(\gamma^2/(1+\gamma^2))$-approximation guaranteed by the stationary points of $f$ itself.Similarly, for the non-monotone case, we devise another auxiliary function $F$ whose stationary points can achieve an optimal $\frac{1-\min_{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathcal{C}}\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_{\infty}}{4}$-approximation guarantee where $\mathcal{C}$ is a convex constraint set.In contrast, the stationary points of the original non-monotone DR-submodular function can be arbitrarily bad~\citep{chen2023continuous}.Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of our boosting technique on four problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In all of these four problems, our resulting variants of boosting PGA algorithm beat the previous standard PGA in several aspects such as approximation ratio and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our boosting PGA methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scene Graph Generation (SGG) remains a challenging visual understanding task due to its compositional property.Most previous works adopt a bottom-up, two-stage or point-based, one-stage approach, which often suffers from high time complexity or suboptimal designs.In this work, we propose a novel SGG method to address the aforementioned issues, formulating the task as a bipartite graph construction problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the issues above, we create a transformer-based end-to-end framework to generate the entity and entity-aware predicate proposal set, and infer directed edges to form relation triplets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Moreover, we design a graph assembling module to infer the connectivity of the bipartite scene graph based on our entity-aware structure, enabling us to generate the scene graph in an end-to-end manner.Based on bipartite graph assembling paradigm, we further propose a new technical design to address the efficacy of entity-aware modeling and optimization stability of graph assembling.Equipped with the enhanced entity-aware design, our method achieves optimal performance and time-complexity.Extensive experimental results show that our design is able to achieve the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on three challenging benchmarks, surpassing most of the existing approaches and enjoying higher efficiency in inference.Code is available: https://github.com/Scarecrow0/SGTR</p>

                  <p>This paper investigates the ability of transformer-based models to learn structural recursion from examples.Recursion is a universal concept in both natural and formal languages.Structural recursion is central to the programming language and formal mathematics tasks where symbolic tools currently excel beyond neural models, such as inferring semantic relations between datatypes and emulating program behavior.We introduce a general framework that nicely connects the abstract concepts of structural recursion in the programming language domain to concrete sequence modeling problems and learned models' behavior.The framework includes a representation that captures the general \textit{syntax} of structural recursion, coupled with two different frameworks for understanding their \textit{semantics} -- one that is more natural from a programming languages perspective and one that helps bridge that perspective with a mechanistic understanding of the underlying transformer architecture.   With our framework as a powerful conceptual tool, we identify different issues under various set-ups.The models trained to emulate recursive computations cannot fully capture the recursion yet instead fit short-cut algorithms and thus cannot solve certain edge cases that are under-represented in the training distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, it is difficult for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to mine recursive rules from in-context demonstrations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, these LLMs fail in interesting ways when emulating reduction (step-wise computation) of the recursive function. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large-scale neural language models exhibit a remarkable capacity for in-context learning (ICL): they can infer novel functions from datasets provided as input.Most of our current understanding of when and how ICL arises comes from LMs trained on extremely simple learning problems like linear regression and associative recall.There remains a significant gap between these model problems and the "real" ICL exhibited by LMs trained on large text corpora, which involves not just retrieval and function approximation but free-form generation of language and other structured outputs.In this paper, we study ICL through the lens of a new family of model problems we term in context language learning (ICLL).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In ICLL, LMs are presented with a set of strings from a formal language, and must generate additional strings from the same language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>We focus on in-context learning of regular languages generated by random finite automata.We evaluate a diverse set of neural sequence models (including several RNNs, Transformers, and state-space model variants) on regular ICLL tasks, aiming to answer three questions: (1) Which model classes are empirically capable of ICLL?(2) What algorithmic solutions do successful models implement to perform ICLL?(3) What architectural changes can improve ICLL in less performant models?We first show that Transformers significantly outperform neural sequence models with recurrent or convolutional representations on ICLL tasks.Next, we provide evidence that their ability to do so relies on specialized "n-gram heads" (higher-order variants of induction heads) that compute input-conditional next-token distributions.Finally, we show that hard-wiring these heads into recurrent and convolutional models improves performance not just on ICLL, but natural language modeling -- improving the perplexity of 340M-parameter models by up to 1.14 points (6.7%) on the SlimPajama dataset.</p>

                  <p>Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most frequently performed imaging test in clinical practice.Recent advances in the development of vision-language foundation models (FMs) give rise to the possibility of performing automated CXR interpretation, which can assist physicians with clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.However, developing FMs that can accurately interpret CXRs is challenging due to the (1) limited availability of large-scale vision-language datasets in the medical image domain, (2) lack of vision and language encoders that can capture the complexities of medical data, and (3) absence of evaluation frameworks for benchmarking the abilities of FMs on CXR interpretation.In this work, we address these challenges by first introducing \emph{CheXinstruct} - a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset curated from 28 publicly-available datasets.We then present \emph{CheXagent} - an instruction-tuned FM capable of analyzing and summarizing CXRs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To build CheXagent, we design a clinical large language model (LLM) for parsing radiology reports, a vision encoder for representing CXR images, and a network to bridge the vision and language modalities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Finally, we introduce \emph{CheXbench} - a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate FMs across 8 clinically-relevant CXR interpretation tasks.Extensive quantitative evaluations and qualitative reviews with five expert radiologists demonstrate that CheXagent outperforms previously-developed general- and medical-domain FMs on CheXbench tasks.Furthermore, in an effort to improve model transparency, we perform a fairness evaluation across factors of sex, race and age to highlight potential performance disparities.Our project is at \url{https://stanford-aimi.github.io/chexagent.html}.</p>

We build upon the recommender that has been in production since 2018, RevRecV1.We found that reviewers were being assigned based on prior authorship of files.We reviewed the literature for successful features and experimented with them with RevRecV2 in production.The most important feature in our new model was the familiarity of the author and reviewer, we saw an overall improvement in accuracy of 14 percentage points.   Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

We conduct historical analyses to understand the natural concentration of review workload and the degree of knowledge spreading that is inherent in code review.Even though review workload is highly concentrated, we show that code review natural spreads knowledge thereby reducing the files at risk to turnover.   Using simulation, we evaluate existing code review recommenders and develop novel recommenders to understand their impact on the level of expertise during review, the workload of reviewers, and the files at risk to turnover.Our simulations use seeded random replacement of reviewers to allow us to compare the reviewer recommenders without the confounding variation of different reviewers being replaced for each recommender.   Combining recommenders, we develop the SofiaWL recommender that suggests experts with low active review workload when none of the files under review are known by only one developer.In contrast, when knowledge is concentrated on one developer, it sends the review to other reviewers to spread knowledge.For the projects we study, we are able to globally increase expertise during reviews, +3%, reduce workload concentration, -12%, and reduce the files at risk, -28%.We make our scripts and data available in our replication package.Developers can optimize for a particular outcome measure based on the needs of their project, or use our GitHub bot to automatically balance the outcomes.</p>
