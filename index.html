                  <p>Multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) is a rapidly evolving field, where significant progress, particularly in image-text pairing, has been made through advanced representation learning and cross-modality alignment research.However, current benchmarks for evaluating MMIR performance in image-text pairing within the scientific domain show a notable gap, where chart and table images described in scholarly language usually do not play a significant role.To bridge this gap, we develop a specialised scientific MMIR (SciMMIR) benchmark by leveraging open-access paper collections to extract data relevant to the scientific domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This benchmark comprises 530K meticulously curated image-text pairs, extracted from figures and tables with detailed captions in scientific documents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.885</span></span>We further annotate the image-text pairs with two-level subset-subcategory hierarchy annotations to facilitate a more comprehensive evaluation of the baselines.We conducted zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations on prominent multi-modal image-captioning and visual language models, such as CLIP and BLIP.Our analysis offers critical insights for MMIR in the scientific domain, including the impact of pre-training and fine-tuning settings and the influence of the visual and textual encoders.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All our data and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/Wusiwei0410/SciMMIR. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span></p>

                  <p>Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (DocRTE) is a fundamental task in information systems that aims to simultaneously extract entities with semantic relations from a document.Existing methods heavily rely on a substantial amount of fully labeled data.However, collecting and annotating data for newly emerging relations is time-consuming and labor-intensive.Recent advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, exhibit impressive long-text generation capabilities, inspiring us to explore an alternative approach for obtaining auto-labeled documents with new relations.In this paper, we propose a Zero-shot Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (ZeroDocRTE) framework, which generates labeled data by retrieval and denoising knowledge from LLMs, called GenRDK.Specifically, we propose a chain-of-retrieval prompt to guide ChatGPT to generate labeled long-text data step by step.To improve the quality of synthetic data, we propose a denoising strategy based on the consistency of cross-document knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging our denoised synthetic data, we proceed to fine-tune the LLaMA2-13B-Chat for extracting document-level relation triplets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>We perform experiments for both zero-shot document-level relation and triplet extraction on two public datasets.The experimental results illustrate that our GenRDK framework outperforms strong baselines.</p>

                  <p>Roadside unit (RSU) can significantly improve the safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication.Currently, the usage of a single RSU mainly focuses on real-time inference and V2X collaboration, while neglecting the potential value of the high-quality data collected by RSU sensors.Integrating the vast amounts of data from numerous RSUs can provide a rich source of data for model training.However, the absence of ground truth annotations and the difficulty of transmitting enormous volumes of data are two inevitable barriers to fully exploiting this hidden value.In this paper, we introduce FedRSU, an innovative federated learning framework for self-supervised scene flow estimation.In FedRSU, we present a recurrent self-supervision training paradigm, where for each RSU, the scene flow prediction of points at every timestamp can be supervised by its subsequent future multi-modality observation.Another key component of FedRSU is federated learning, where multiple devices collaboratively train an ML model while keeping the training data local and private.With the power of the recurrent self-supervised learning paradigm, FL is able to leverage innumerable underutilized data from RSU.To verify the FedRSU framework, we construct a large-scale multi-modality dataset RSU-SF.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset consists of 17 RSU clients, covering various scenarios, modalities, and sensor settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span>Based on RSU-SF, we show that FedRSU can greatly improve model performance in ITS and provide a comprehensive benchmark under diverse FL scenarios.To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first real-world LiDAR-camera multi-modal dataset and benchmark for the FL community.</p>

Additionally, we simply apply red teaming alignment to LLaVA-v1.5 with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) using RTVLM, and this bolsters the models' performance with 10% in RTVLM test set, 13% in MM-Hal, and without noticeable decline in MM-Bench, overpassing other LLaVA-based models with regular alignment data.This reveals that current open-sourced VLMs still lack red teaming alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets will be open-source. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Pain assessment in individuals with neurological conditions, especially those with limited self-report ability and altered facial expressions, presents challenges.Existing measures, relying on direct observation by caregivers, lack sensitivity and specificity.In cerebral palsy, pain is a common comorbidity and a reliable evaluation protocol is crucial.Thus, having an automatic system that recognizes facial expressions could be of enormous help when diagnosing pain in this type of patient.   Objectives: 1) to build a dataset of facial pain expressions in individuals with cerebral palsy, and 2) to develop an automated facial recognition system based on deep learning for pain assessment addressed to this population.   Methods: Ten neural networks were trained on three pain image databases, including the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database, the Multimodal Intensity Pain Dataset, and the Delaware Pain Database.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, a curated dataset (CPPAIN) was created, consisting of 109 preprocessed facial pain expression images from individuals with cerebral palsy, categorized by two physiotherapists using the Facial Action Coding System observational scale.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>Results: InceptionV3 exhibited promising performance on the CP-PAIN dataset, achieving an accuracy of 62.67% and an F1 score of 61.12%.Explainable artificial intelligence techniques revealed consistent essential features for pain identification across models.   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models for robust pain detection in populations with neurological conditions and communication disabilities.The creation of a larger dataset specific to cerebral palsy would further enhance model accuracy, offering a valuable tool for discerning subtle and idiosyncratic pain expressions.The insights gained could extend to other complex neurological conditions.</p>

This process was guided by our ontology and involved a thorough automatic and manual filtering process, yielding a set of 216 maths problems.We conducted comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs on MORE.The results show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions.This strongly suggests that current LLMs lack robust mathematical skills and deep reasoning abilities.This research not only identifies multiple gaps in the capabilities of current models, but also highlights multiple potential directions for future development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset will be made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/GSM8k_MORE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span></p>

                  <p>There are two common ways in which developers are incorporating proprietary and domain-specific data when building applications of Large Language Models (LLMs): Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-Tuning.RAG augments the prompt with the external data, while fine-Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself.However, the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood.In this paper, we propose a pipeline for fine-tuning and RAG, and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs, including Llama2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.Our pipeline consists of multiple stages, including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers, using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results.We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine-Tuning pipeline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p.when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further.In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%.Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.</p>

                  <p>The evolution of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been significantly influenced by six core challenges (Koehn and Knowles, 2017), which have acted as benchmarks for progress in this field.This study revisits these challenges, offering insights into their ongoing relevance in the context of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): domain mismatch, amount of parallel data, rare word prediction, translation of long sentences, attention model as word alignment, and sub-optimal beam search.Our empirical findings indicate that LLMs effectively lessen the reliance on parallel data for major languages in the pretraining phase.Additionally, the LLM-based translation system significantly enhances the translation of long sentences that contain approximately 80 words and shows the capability to translate documents of up to 512 words.However, despite these significant improvements, the challenges of domain mismatch and prediction of rare words persist.While the challenges of word alignment and beam search, specifically associated with NMT, may not apply to LLMs, we identify three new challenges for LLMs in translation tasks: inference efficiency, translation of low-resource languages in the pretraining phase, and human-aligned evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets and models are released at https://github.com/pangjh3/LLM4MT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used in training large language models~(LLMs) for preventing unexpected outputs, \eg reducing harmfulness and errors.However, existing RL methods mostly adopt the instance-level reward, which is unable to provide fine-grained supervision for complex reasoning tasks, and can not focus on the few key tokens that lead to the incorrectness.To address it, we propose a new RL method named \textbf{RLMEC} that incorporates a generative model as the reward model, which is trained by the erroneous solution rewriting task under the minimum editing constraint, and can produce token-level rewards for RL training.Based on the generative reward model, we design the token-level RL objective for training and an imitation-based regularization for stabilizing RL process.And the both objectives focus on the learning of the key tokens for the erroneous solution, reducing the effect of other unimportant tokens.The experiment results on mathematical tasks and question-answering tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RLMEC}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span></p>

                  <p>Without human annotations, a typical Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection (UVAD) method needs to train two models that generate pseudo labels for each other.In previous work, the two models are closely entangled with each other, and it is not known how to upgrade their method without modifying their training framework significantly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, previous work usually adopts fixed thresholding to obtain pseudo labels, however the user-specified threshold is not reliable which inevitably introduces errors into the training process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>To alleviate these two problems, we propose a novel interleaved framework that alternately trains a One-Class Classification (OCC) model and a Weakly-Supervised (WS) model for UVAD.The OCC or WS models in our method can be easily replaced with other OCC or WS models, which facilitates our method to upgrade with the most recent developments in both fields.For handling the fixed thresholding problem, we break through the conventional cognitive boundary and propose a weighted OCC model that can be trained on both normal and abnormal data.We also propose an adaptive mechanism for automatically finding the optimal threshold for the WS model in a loose to strict manner.Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UVAD method outperforms previous approaches.</p>

                  <p>Without human annotations, a typical Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection (UVAD) method needs to train two models that generate pseudo labels for each other.In previous work, the two models are closely entangled with each other, and it is not known how to upgrade their method without modifying their training framework significantly.Second, previous work usually adopts fixed thresholding to obtain pseudo labels, however the user-specified threshold is not reliable which inevitably introduces errors into the training process.To alleviate these two problems, we propose a novel interleaved framework that alternately trains a One-Class Classification (OCC) model and a Weakly-Supervised (WS) model for UVAD.The OCC or WS models in our method can be easily replaced with other OCC or WS models, which facilitates our method to upgrade with the most recent developments in both fields.For handling the fixed thresholding problem, we break through the conventional cognitive boundary and propose a weighted OCC model that can be trained on both normal and abnormal data.We also propose an adaptive mechanism for automatically finding the optimal threshold for the WS model in a loose to strict manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UVAD method outperforms previous approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing network stacks tackle performance and scalability aspects by relying on multiple receive queues.However, at software level, each queue is processed by a single thread, which prevents simultaneous work on the same queue and limits performance in terms of tail latency.To overcome this limitation, we introduce COREC, the first software implementation of a concurrent non-blocking single-queue receive driver.By sharing a single queue among multiple threads, workload distribution is improved, leading to a work-conserving policy for network stacks.On the technical side, instead of relying on traditional critical sections - which would sequentialize the operations by threads - COREC coordinates the threads that concurrently access the same receive queue in non-blocking manner via atomic machine instructions from the Read-Modify-Write (RMW) class.These instructions allow threads to access and update memory locations atomically, based on specific conditions, such as the matching of a target value selected by the thread.Also, they enable making any update globally visible in the memory hierarchy, bypassing interference on memory consistency caused by the CPU store buffers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the possible additional reordering, which our approach may occasionally cause, is non-critical and has minimal impact on performance, even in the worst-case scenario of a single large TCP flow, with performance impairments accounting to at most 2-3 percent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Conversely, substantial latency gains are achieved when handling UDP traffic, real-world traffic mix, and multiple shorter TCP flows.</p>

                  <p>When selecting data for training large-scale models, standard practice is to filter for examples that match human notions of data quality.Such filtering yields qualitatively clean datapoints that intuitively should improve model behavior.However, in practice the opposite can often happen: we find that selecting according to similarity with "high quality" data sources may not increase (and can even hurt) performance compared to randomly selecting data.   To develop better methods for selecting data, we start by framing dataset selection as an optimization problem that we can directly solve for: given target tasks, a learning algorithm, and candidate data, select the subset that maximizes model performance.This framework thus avoids handpicked notions of data quality, and instead models explicitly how the learning process uses train datapoints to predict on the target tasks.Our resulting method greatly improves language model (LM) performance on both pre-specified tasks and previously unseen tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, choosing target tasks representative of standard LM problems and evaluating on diverse held-out benchmarks, our selected datasets provide a 2x compute multiplier over baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated learning is a distributed collaborative machine learning paradigm that has gained strong momentum in recent years.In federated learning, a central server periodically coordinates models with clients and aggregates the models trained locally by clients without necessitating access to local data.Despite its potential, the implementation of federated learning continues to encounter several challenges, predominantly the slow convergence that is largely due to data heterogeneity.The slow convergence becomes particularly problematic in cross-device federated learning scenarios where clients may be strongly limited by computing power and storage space, and hence counteracting methods that induce additional computation or memory cost on the client side such as auxiliary objective terms and larger training iterations can be impractical.In this paper, we propose a novel federated aggregation strategy, TurboSVM-FL, that poses no additional computation burden on the client side and can significantly accelerate convergence for federated classification task, especially when clients are "lazy" and train their models solely for few epochs for next global aggregation.TurboSVM-FL extensively utilizes support vector machine to conduct selective aggregation and max-margin spread-out regularization on class embeddings.We evaluate TurboSVM-FL on multiple datasets including FEMNIST, CelebA, and Shakespeare using user-independent validation with non-iid data distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that TurboSVM-FL can significantly outperform existing popular algorithms on convergence rate and reduce communication rounds while delivering better test metrics including accuracy, F1 score, and MCC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bug tracking systems store many bug reports, some of which are related to security.Identifying those security bug reports (SBRs) may help us predict some security-related bugs and solve security issues promptly so that the project can avoid threats and attacks.However, in the real world, the ratio of security bug reports is severely low; thus, directly training a prediction model with raw data may result in inaccurate results.Faced with the massive challenge of data imbalance, many researchers in the past have attempted to use text filtering or clustering methods to minimize the proportion of non-security bug reports (NSBRs) or apply oversampling methods to synthesize SBRs to make the dataset as balanced as possible.Nevertheless, there are still two challenges to those methods: 1) They ignore long-distance contextual information.2) They fail to generate an utterly balanced dataset.To tackle these two challenges, we propose SEDAC, a new SBR identification method that generates similar bug report vectors to solve data imbalance problems and accurately detect security bug reports.Unlike previous studies, it first converts bug reports into individual bug report vectors with distilBERT, which are based on word2vec.Then, it trains a generative model through conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) to generate similar vectors with security labels, which makes the number of SBRs equal to NSBRs'.Finally, balanced data are used to train a security bug report classifier.To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct it on 45,940 bug reports from Chromium and four Apache projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results show that SEDAC outperforms all the baselines in g-measure with improvements of around 14.24%-50.10%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span></p>

                  <p>While deep neural networks have achieved remarkable performance, data augmentation has emerged as a crucial strategy to mitigate overfitting and enhance network performance.These techniques hold particular significance in industrial manufacturing contexts.Recently, image mixing-based methods have been introduced, exhibiting improved performance on public benchmark datasets.However, their application to industrial tasks remains challenging.The manufacturing environment generates massive amounts of unlabeled data on a daily basis, with only a few instances of abnormal data occurrences.This leads to severe data imbalance.Thus, creating well-balanced datasets is not straightforward due to the high costs associated with labeling.Nonetheless, this is a crucial step for enhancing productivity.For this reason, we introduce ContextMix, a method tailored for industrial applications and benchmark datasets.ContextMix generates novel data by resizing entire images and integrating them into other images within the batch.This approach enables our method to learn discriminative features based on varying sizes from resized images and train informative secondary features for object recognition using occluded images.With the minimal additional computation cost of image resizing, ContextMix enhances performance compared to existing augmentation techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate its effectiveness across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using various network architectures on public benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our proposed method demonstrates improved results across a range of robustness tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Its efficacy in real industrial environments is particularly noteworthy, as demonstrated using the passive component dataset.</p>

                  <p>Wireless Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, particularly gaining momentum in domains with confidential and private data on mobile clients.However, the location-dependent performance, in terms of transmission rates and susceptibility to transmission errors, poses major challenges for wireless FL's convergence speed and accuracy.The challenge is more acute for hostile environments without a metric that authenticates the data quality and security profile of the clients.In this context, this paper proposes a novel risk-aware accelerated FL framework that accounts for the clients heterogeneity in the amount of possessed data, transmission rates, transmission errors, and trustworthiness.Classifying clients according to their location-dependent performance and trustworthiness profiles, we propose a dynamic risk-aware global model aggregation scheme that allows clients to participate in descending order of their transmission rates and an ascending trustworthiness constraint.In particular, the transmission rate is the dominant participation criterion for initial rounds to accelerate the convergence speed.Our model then progressively relaxes the transmission rate restriction to explore more training data at cell-edge clients.The aggregation rounds incorporate a debiasing factor that accounts for transmission errors.Risk-awareness is enabled by a validation set, where the base station eliminates non-trustworthy clients at the fine-tuning stage.The proposed scheme is benchmarked against a conservative scheme (i.e., only allowing trustworthy devices) and an aggressive scheme (i.e., oblivious to the trust metric).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The numerical results highlight the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of accuracy and convergence speed when compared to both benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span></p>

                  <p>Commit messages are natural language descriptions of code changes, which are important for software evolution such as code understanding and maintenance.However, previous methods are trained on the entire dataset without considering the fact that a portion of commit messages adhere to good practice (i.e., good-practice commits), while the rest do not.On the basis of our empirical study, we discover that training on good-practice commits significantly contributes to the commit message generation.Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel knowledge-aware denoising learning method called KADEL.Considering that good-practice commits constitute only a small proportion of the dataset, we align the remaining training samples with these good-practice commits.To achieve this, we propose a model that learns the commit knowledge by training on good-practice commits.This knowledge model enables supplementing more information for training samples that do not conform to good practice.However, since the supplementary information may contain noise or prediction errors, we propose a dynamic denoising training method.This method composes a distribution-aware confidence function and a dynamic distribution list, which enhances the effectiveness of the training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on the whole MCMD dataset demonstrate that our method overall achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Our source code and data are available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/KADEL</p>

                  <p>Large-scale neural language models exhibit a remarkable capacity for in-context learning (ICL): they can infer novel functions from datasets provided as input.Most of our current understanding of when and how ICL arises comes from LMs trained on extremely simple learning problems like linear regression and associative recall.There remains a significant gap between these model problems and the "real" ICL exhibited by LMs trained on large text corpora, which involves not just retrieval and function approximation but free-form generation of language and other structured outputs.In this paper, we study ICL through the lens of a new family of model problems we term in context language learning (ICLL).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In ICLL, LMs are presented with a set of strings from a formal language, and must generate additional strings from the same language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>We focus on in-context learning of regular languages generated by random finite automata.We evaluate a diverse set of neural sequence models (including several RNNs, Transformers, and state-space model variants) on regular ICLL tasks, aiming to answer three questions: (1) Which model classes are empirically capable of ICLL?(2) What algorithmic solutions do successful models implement to perform ICLL?(3) What architectural changes can improve ICLL in less performant models?We first show that Transformers significantly outperform neural sequence models with recurrent or convolutional representations on ICLL tasks.Next, we provide evidence that their ability to do so relies on specialized "n-gram heads" (higher-order variants of induction heads) that compute input-conditional next-token distributions.Finally, we show that hard-wiring these heads into recurrent and convolutional models improves performance not just on ICLL, but natural language modeling -- improving the perplexity of 340M-parameter models by up to 1.14 points (6.7%) on the SlimPajama dataset.</p>

We build upon the recommender that has been in production since 2018, RevRecV1.We found that reviewers were being assigned based on prior authorship of files.We reviewed the literature for successful features and experimented with them with RevRecV2 in production.The most important feature in our new model was the familiarity of the author and reviewer, we saw an overall improvement in accuracy of 14 percentage points.   Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

We conduct historical analyses to understand the natural concentration of review workload and the degree of knowledge spreading that is inherent in code review.Even though review workload is highly concentrated, we show that code review natural spreads knowledge thereby reducing the files at risk to turnover.   Using simulation, we evaluate existing code review recommenders and develop novel recommenders to understand their impact on the level of expertise during review, the workload of reviewers, and the files at risk to turnover.Our simulations use seeded random replacement of reviewers to allow us to compare the reviewer recommenders without the confounding variation of different reviewers being replaced for each recommender.   Combining recommenders, we develop the SofiaWL recommender that suggests experts with low active review workload when none of the files under review are known by only one developer.In contrast, when knowledge is concentrated on one developer, it sends the review to other reviewers to spread knowledge.For the projects we study, we are able to globally increase expertise during reviews, +3%, reduce workload concentration, -12%, and reduce the files at risk, -28%.We make our scripts and data available in our replication package.Developers can optimize for a particular outcome measure based on the needs of their project, or use our GitHub bot to automatically balance the outcomes.</p>
