                  <p>Motion mode (M-mode) recording is an essential part of echocardiography to measure cardiac dimension and function.However, the current diagnosis cannot build an automatic scheme, as there are three fundamental obstructs: Firstly, there is no open dataset available to build the automation for ensuring constant results and bridging M-mode echocardiography with real-time instance segmentation (RIS); Secondly, the examination is involving the time-consuming manual labelling upon M-mode echocardiograms; Thirdly, as objects in echocardiograms occupy a significant portion of pixels, the limited receptive field in existing backbones (e.g., ResNet) composed from multiple convolution layers are inefficient to cover the period of a valve movement.Existing non-local attentions (NL) compromise being unable real-time with a high computation overhead or losing information from a simplified version of the non-local block.Therefore, we proposed RAMEM, a real-time automatic M-mode echocardiography measurement scheme, contributes three aspects to answer the problems: 1) provide MEIS, a dataset of M-mode echocardiograms for instance segmentation, to enable consistent results and support the development of an automatic scheme; 2) propose panel attention, local-to-global efficient attention by pixel-unshuffling, embedding with updated UPANets V2 in a RIS scheme toward big object detection with global receptive field; 3) develop and implement AMEM, an efficient algorithm of automatic M-mode echocardiography measurement enabling fast and accurate automatic labelling among diagnosis.The experimental results show that RAMEM surpasses existing RIS backbones (with non-local attention) in PASCAL 2012 SBD and human performances in real-time MEIS tested.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code of MEIS and dataset are available at https://github.com/hanktseng131415go/RAME. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span></p>

                  <p>While cities around the world are looking for smart ways to use new advances in data collection, management, and analysis to address their problems, the complex nature of urban issues and the overwhelming amount of available data have posed significant challenges in translating these efforts into actionable insights.In the past few years, urban visual analytics tools have significantly helped tackle these challenges.When analyzing a feature of interest, an urban expert must transform, integrate, and visualize different thematic (e.g., sunlight access, demographic) and physical (e.g., buildings, street networks) data layers, oftentimes across multiple spatial and temporal scales.However, integrating and analyzing these layers require expertise in different fields, increasing development time and effort.This makes the entire visual data exploration and system implementation difficult for programmers and also sets a high entry barrier for urban experts outside of computer science.With this in mind, in this paper, we present the Urban Toolkit (UTK), a flexible and extensible visualization framework that enables the easy authoring of web-based visualizations through a new high-level grammar specifically built with common urban use cases in mind.In order to facilitate the integration and visualization of different urban data, we also propose the concept of knots to merge thematic and physical urban layers.We evaluate our approach through use cases and a series of interviews with experts and practitioners from different domains, including urban accessibility, urban planning, architecture, and climate science.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>UTK is available at urbantk.org. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span></p>

                  <p>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) based physiological measurement is an emerging yet crucial vision task, whose challenge lies in exploring accurate rPPG prediction from facial videos accompanied by noises of illumination variations, facial occlusions, head movements, \etc, in a non-contact manner.Existing mainstream CNN-based models make efforts to detect physiological signals by capturing subtle color changes in facial regions of interest (ROI) caused by heartbeats.However, such models are constrained by the limited local spatial or temporal receptive fields in the neural units.Unlike them, a native Transformer-based framework called Dual-path TokenLearner (Dual-TL) is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the concept of learnable tokens to integrate both spatial and temporal informative contexts from the global perspective of the video.Specifically, the proposed Dual-TL uses a Spatial TokenLearner (S-TL) to explore associations in different facial ROIs, which promises the rPPG prediction far away from noisy ROI disturbances.Complementarily, a Temporal TokenLearner (T-TL) is designed to infer the quasi-periodic pattern of heartbeats, which eliminates temporal disturbances such as head movements.The two TokenLearners, S-TL and T-TL, are executed in a dual-path mode.This enables the model to reduce noise disturbances for final rPPG signal prediction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on four physiological measurement benchmark datasets are conducted. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>The Dual-TL achieves state-of-the-art performances in both intra- and cross-dataset testings, demonstrating its immense potential as a basic backbone for rPPG measurement.The source code is available at \href{https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/Dual-TL}{https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/Dual-TL}</p>

                  <p>Recent work on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has pointed out that algorithmic information about good policies can be extracted from offline data which lack explicit information about executed actions.For example, videos of humans or robots may convey a lot of implicit information about rewarding action sequences, but a DRL machine that wants to profit from watching such videos must first learn by itself to identify and recognize relevant states/actions/rewards.Without relying on ground-truth annotations, our new method called Deep State Identifier learns to predict returns from episodes encoded as videos.Then it uses a kind of mask-based sensitivity analysis to extract/identify important critical states.Extensive experiments showcase our method's potential for understanding and improving agent behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and the generated datasets are available at https://github.com/AI-Initiative-KAUST/VideoRLCS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span></p>

                  <p>Purpose: In this paper, we establish a baseline for handwritten stenography recognition, using the novel LION dataset, and investigate the impact of including selected aspects of stenographic theory into the recognition process.We make the LION dataset publicly available with the aim of encouraging future research in handwritten stenography recognition.   Methods: A state-of-the-art text recognition model is trained to establish a baseline.Stenographic domain knowledge is integrated by applying four different encoding methods that transform the target sequence into representations, which approximate selected aspects of the writing system.Results are further improved by integrating a pre-training scheme, based on synthetic data.   Results:The baseline model achieves an average test character error rate (CER) of 29.81% and a word error rate (WER) of 55.14%.Test error rates are reduced significantly by combining stenography-specific target sequence encodings with pre-training and fine-tuning, yielding CERs in the range of 24.5% - 26% and WERs of 44.8% - 48.2%.   Conclusion:The obtained results demonstrate the challenging nature of stenography recognition.Integrating stenography-specific knowledge, in conjunction with pre-training and fine-tuning on synthetic data, yields considerable improvements.Together with our precursor study on the subject, this is the first work to apply modern handwritten text recognition to stenography.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and our code are publicly available via Zenodo. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span></p>

                  <p>Neuromorphic vision sensors, or event cameras, differ from conventional cameras in that they do not capture images at a specified rate.Instead, they asynchronously log local brightness changes at each pixel.As a result, event cameras only record changes in a given scene, and do so with very high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power requirements.Recent research has demonstrated how these characteristics make event cameras extremely practical sensors in driver monitoring systems (DMS), enabling the tracking of high-speed eye motion and blinks.This research provides a proof of concept to expand event-based DMS techniques to include seatbelt state detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using an event simulator, a dataset of 108,691 synthetic neuromorphic frames of car occupants was generated from a near-infrared (NIR) dataset, and split into training, validation, and test sets for a seatbelt state detection algorithm based on a recurrent convolutional neural network (CNN). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span>In addition, a smaller set of real event data was collected and reserved for testing.In a binary classification task, the fastened/unfastened frames were identified with an F1 score of 0.989 and 0.944 on the simulated and real test sets respectively.When the problem extended to also classify the action of fastening/unfastening the seatbelt, respective F1 scores of 0.964 and 0.846 were achieved.</p>

                  <p>We propose \emph{regular expression inference (REI)} as a challenge for code/language modelling, and the wider machine learning community.REI is a supervised machine learning (ML) and program synthesis task, and poses the problem of finding minimal regular expressions from examples: Given two finite sets of strings $P$ and $N$ and a cost function $\text{cost}(\cdot)$, the task is to generate an expression $r$ that accepts all strings in $P$ and rejects all strings in $N$, while no other such expression $r'$ exists with $\text{cost}(r')<\text{cost}(r)$.   REI has advantages as a challenge problem: (i) regular expressions are well-known, widely used, and a natural idealisation of code; (ii) REI's asymptotic worst-case complexity is well understood; (iii) REI has a small number of easy to understand parameters (e.g.~$P$ or $N$ cardinality, string lengths of examples, or the cost function); this lets us easily finetune REI-hardness; (iv) REI is an unsolved problem for deep learning based ML.   Recently, an REI solver was implemented on GPUs, using program synthesis techniques.This enabled, for the first time, fast generation of minimal expressions for complex REI instances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this advance, we generate and publish the first large-scale datasets for REI, and devise and evaluate several initial heuristic and machine learning baselines.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.831</span></span>We invite the community to participate and explore ML methods that learn to solve REI problems.We believe that progress in REI directly translates to code/language modelling.</p>

                  <p>Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has shown impressive results on diverse downstream tasks by offline training on large-scale datasets.Regarding the growing nature of real-world data, such an offline training paradigm on ever-expanding data is unsustainable, because models lack the continual learning ability to accumulate knowledge constantly.However, most continual learning studies are limited to uni-modal classification and existing multi-modal datasets cannot simulate continual non-stationary data stream scenarios.To support the study of Vision-Language Continual Pretraining (VLCP), we first contribute a comprehensive and unified benchmark dataset P9D which contains over one million product image-text pairs from 9 industries.The data from each industry as an independent task supports continual learning and conforms to the real-world long-tail nature to simulate pretraining on web data.We comprehensively study the characteristics and challenges of VLCP, and propose a new algorithm: Compatible momentum contrast with Topology Preservation, dubbed CTP.The compatible momentum model absorbs the knowledge of the current and previous-task models to flexibly update the modal feature.Moreover, Topology Preservation transfers the knowledge of embedding across tasks while preserving the flexibility of feature adjustment.The experimental results demonstrate our method not only achieves superior performance compared with other baselines but also does not bring an expensive training burden.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/KevinLight831/CTP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.859</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D scene reconstruction is a long-standing vision task.Existing approaches can be categorized into geometry-based and learning-based methods.The former leverages multi-view geometry but can face catastrophic failures due to the reliance on accurate pixel correspondence across views.The latter was proffered to mitigate these issues by learning 2D or 3D representation directly.However, without a large-scale video or 3D training data, it can hardly generalize to diverse real-world scenarios due to the presence of tens of millions or even billions of optimization parameters in the deep network.Recently, robust monocular depth estimation models trained with large-scale datasets have been proven to possess weak 3D geometry prior, but they are insufficient for reconstruction due to the unknown camera parameters, the affine-invariant property, and inter-frame inconsistency.Here, we propose a novel test-time optimization approach that can transfer the robustness of affine-invariant depth models such as LeReS to challenging diverse scenes while ensuring inter-frame consistency, with only dozens of parameters to optimize per video frame.Specifically, our approach involves freezing the pre-trained affine-invariant depth model's depth predictions, rectifying them by optimizing the unknown scale-shift values with a geometric consistency alignment module, and employing the resulting scale-consistent depth maps to robustly obtain camera poses and achieve dense scene reconstruction, even in low-texture regions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset reconstruction on five zero-shot testing datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span></p>

                  <p>When it comes to in-vehicle networks (IVNs), the controller area network -- CAN -- bus dominates the market; automobiles manufactured and sold around the world depend on the CAN bus for safety-critical communications between various components of the vehicle (e.g., the engine, the transmission, the steering column).Unfortunately, the CAN bus is inherently insecure; in fact, it completely lacks controls such as authentication, authorization, and confidentiality (i.e., encryption).Therefore, researchers have travailed to develop automotive security enhancements.The automotive intrusion detection system (IDS) is especially popular in the literature -- due to its relatively low cost in terms of money, resource utilization, and implementation effort.That said, developing and evaluating an automotive IDS is often challenging; if researchers do not have access to a test vehicle, then they are forced to depend on publicly available CAN data -- which is not without limitations.Lack of access to adequate CAN data, then, becomes a barrier to entry into automotive security research.   We seek to lower that barrier to entry by introducing a new CAN dataset to facilitate the development and evaluation of automotive IDSs.Our dataset, dubbed can-train-and-test, provides CAN data from four different vehicles produced by two different manufacturers.The attack captures for each vehicle model are equivalent, enabling researchers to assess the ability of a given IDS to generalize to different vehicle models and even different vehicle manufacturers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset contains replayable .log files as well as labeled and unlabeled .csv files, thereby meeting a variety of development and evaluation needs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>Furthermore, can-train-and-test offers nine unique attacks, ranging from denial of service (DoS) to gear spoofing to standstill...</p>

In this paper, we apply six SZZ algorithms to 76,046 pairs of bug-fixing patches and bug-introducing commits from the Linux kernel.Our findings reveal that SZZ algorithms experience a more significant decline in recall on our dataset (13.8%) as compared to prior findings reported by Rosa et al., and the disparities between the individual SZZ algorithms diminish.Moreover, we find that 17.47% of bug-fixing commits are ghost commits.Finally, we propose Tracing-Commit SZZ (TC-SZZ), that traces all commits in the change history of lines modified or deleted in bug-fixing commits.Applying TC-SZZ to all failure cases, excluding ghost commits, we found that TC-SZZ could identify 17.7% of them.Our further analysis found that 34.6% of bug-inducing commits were in the function history, 27.5% in the file history (but not in the function history), and...</p>

                  <p>Multi-label image recognition in the low-label regime is a task of great challenge and practical significance.Previous works have focused on learning the alignment between textual and visual spaces to compensate for limited image labels, yet may suffer from reduced accuracy due to the scarcity of high-quality multi-label annotations.In this research, we leverage the powerful alignment between textual and visual features pretrained with millions of auxiliary image-text pairs.We introduce an efficient and effective framework called Evidence-guided Dual Context Optimization (DualCoOp++), which serves as a unified approach for addressing partial-label and zero-shot multi-label recognition.In DualCoOp++ we separately encode evidential, positive, and negative contexts for target classes as parametric components of the linguistic input (i.e., prompts).The evidential context aims to discover all the related visual content for the target class, and serves as guidance to aggregate positive and negative contexts from the spatial domain of the image, enabling better distinguishment between similar categories.Additionally, we introduce a Winner-Take-All module that promotes inter-class interaction during training, while avoiding the need for extra parameters and costs.As DualCoOp++ imposes minimal additional learnable overhead on the pretrained vision-language framework, it enables rapid adaptation to multi-label recognition tasks with limited annotations and even unseen classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on standard multi-label recognition benchmarks across two challenging low-label settings demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a well-known method for exposing bugs/vulnerabilities in software systems.Popular fuzzers, such as AFL, use a biased random search over the domain of program inputs, where 100s or 1000s of inputs (test cases) are executed per second in order to expose bugs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If a bug is discovered, it can either be fixed manually by the developer or fixed automatically using an Automated Program Repair (APR) tool. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>Like fuzzing, many existing APR tools are search-based, but over the domain of patches rather than inputs.   In this paper, we propose search-based program repair as patch-level fuzzing.The basic idea is to adapt a fuzzer (AFL) to fuzz over the patch space rather than the input space.Thus we use a patch-space fuzzer to explore a patch space, while using a traditional input level fuzzer to rule out patch candidates and help in patch selection.To improve the throughput, we propose a compilation-free patch validation methodology, where we execute the original (unpatched) program natively, then selectively interpret only the specific patched statements and expressions.Since this avoids (re)compilation, we show that compilation-free patch validation can achieve a similar throughput as input-level fuzzing (100s or 1000s of execs/sec).We show that patch-level fuzzing and input-level fuzzing can be combined, for a co-exploration of both spaces in order to find better quality patches.Such a collaboration between input-level fuzzing and patch-level fuzzing is then employed to search over candidate fix locations, as well as patch candidates in each fix location.</p>

                  <p>Recent work in Machine Learning and Computer Vision has highlighted the presence of various types of systematic flaws inside ground truth object recognition benchmark datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our basic tenet is that these flaws are rooted in the many-to-many mappings which exist between the visual information encoded in images and the intended semantics of the labels annotating them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>The net consequence is that the current annotation process is largely under-specified, thus leaving too much freedom to the subjective judgment of annotators.In this paper, we propose vTelos, an integrated Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Representation, and Computer Vision methodology whose main goal is to make explicit the (otherwise implicit) intended annotation semantics, thus minimizing the number and role of subjective choices.A key element of vTelos is the exploitation of the WordNet lexico-semantic hierarchy as the main means for providing the meaning of natural language labels and, as a consequence, for driving the annotation of images based on the objects and the visual properties they depict.The methodology is validated on images populating a subset of the ImageNet hierarchy.</p>

                  <p>Despite the increasing interest in quantum computing, the aspect of development to achieve cost-effective and reliable quantum software applications has been slow.One barrier is the software engineering of quantum programs, which can be approached from two directions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the one hand, many software engineering practices, debugging in particular, are bound to classical computing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>On the other hand, quantum programming is closely associated with the phenomena of quantum physics, and consequently, the way we express programs resembles the early days of programming.Moreover, much of the software engineering research today focuses on agile development, where computing cycles are cheap and new software can be rapidly deployed and tested, whereas in the quantum context, executions may consume lots of energy, and test runs may require lots of work to interpret.In this paper, we aim at bridging this gap by starting with the quantum computing workflow and by mapping existing software engineering research to this workflow.Based on the mapping, we then identify directions for software engineering research for quantum computing.</p>

In this study, we utilized ChatGPT to correct open-ended questions answered by 42 industry professionals on two topics.Evaluating the corrections and feedback provided by ChatGPT, we observed that it is capable of identifying semantic details in responses that other metrics cannot observe.Furthermore, we noticed that, in general, subject matter experts tended to agree with the corrections and feedback given by ChatGPT.</p>
