                  <p>Semantic part segmentation provides an intricate and interpretable understanding of an object, thereby benefiting numerous downstream tasks.However, the need for exhaustive annotations impedes its usage across diverse object types.This paper focuses on learning part segmentation from synthetic animals, leveraging the Skinned Multi-Animal Linear (SMAL) models to scale up existing synthetic data generated by computer-aided design (CAD) animal models.Compared to CAD models, SMAL models generate data with a wider range of poses observed in real-world scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, our first contribution is to construct a synthetic animal dataset of tigers and horses with more pose diversity, termed Synthetic Animal Parts (SAP). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>We then benchmark Syn-to-Real animal part segmentation from SAP to PartImageNet, namely SynRealPart, with existing semantic segmentation domain adaptation methods and further improve them as our second contribution.Concretely, we examine three Syn-to-Real adaptation methods but observe relative performance drop due to the innate difference between the two tasks.To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method called Class-Balanced Fourier Data Mixing (CB-FDM).Fourier Data Mixing aligns the spectral amplitudes of synthetic images with real images, thereby making the mixed images have more similar frequency content to real images.We further use Class-Balanced Pseudo-Label Re-Weighting to alleviate the imbalanced class distribution.We demonstrate the efficacy of CB-FDM on SynRealPart over previous methods with significant performance improvements.Remarkably, our third contribution is to reveal that the learned parts from synthetic tiger and horse are transferable across all quadrupeds in PartImageNet, further underscoring the utility and potential applications of animal part segmentation.</p>

                  <p>Dataset distillation aims to generate a smaller but representative subset from a large dataset, which allows a model to be trained efficiently, meanwhile evaluating on the original testing data distribution to achieve decent performance.Many prior works have aimed to align with diverse aspects of the original datasets, such as matching the training weight trajectories, gradient, feature/BatchNorm distributions, etc.In this work, we show how to distill various large-scale datasets such as full ImageNet-1K/21K under a conventional input resolution of 224$\times$224 to achieve the best accuracy over all previous approaches, including SRe$^2$L, TESLA and MTT.To achieve this, we introduce a simple yet effective ${\bf C}$urriculum ${\bf D}$ata ${\bf A}$ugmentation ($\texttt{CDA}$) during data synthesis that obtains the accuracy on large-scale ImageNet-1K and 21K with 63.2% under IPC (Images Per Class) 50 and 36.1% under IPC 20, respectively.Finally, we show that, by integrating all our enhancements together, the proposed model beats the current state-of-the-art by more than 4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K/21K and for the first time, reduces the gap to its full-data training counterpart to less than absolute 15%.Moreover, this work represents the inaugural success in dataset distillation on larger-scale ImageNet-21K under the standard 224$\times$224 resolution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and distilled ImageNet-21K dataset of 20 IPC, 2K recovery budget are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/SRe2L/tree/main/CDA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span></p>

                  <p>We address the problem of synthesizing multi-view optical illusions: images that change appearance upon a transformation, such as a flip or rotation.We propose a simple, zero-shot method for obtaining these illusions from off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion models.During the reverse diffusion process, we estimate the noise from different views of a noisy image.We then combine these noise estimates together and denoise the image.A theoretical analysis suggests that this method works precisely for views that can be written as orthogonal transformations, of which permutations are a subset.This leads to the idea of a visual anagram--an image that changes appearance under some rearrangement of pixels.This includes rotations and flips, but also more exotic pixel permutations such as a jigsaw rearrangement.Our approach also naturally extends to illusions with more than two views.We provide both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness and flexibility of our method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Please see our project webpage for additional visualizations and results: https://dangeng.github.io/visual_anagrams/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of commercial AI products based on generative, multi-purpose AI systems promising a unified approach to building machine learning (ML) models into technology.However, this ambition of "generality" comes at a steep cost to the environment, given the amount of energy these systems require and the amount of carbon that they emit.In this work, we propose the first systematic comparison of the ongoing inference cost of various categories of ML systems, covering both task-specific (i.e. finetuned models that carry out a single task) and `general-purpose' models, (i.e. those trained for multiple tasks).We measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these models.We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters.We conclude with a discussion around the current trend of deploying multi-purpose generative ML systems, and caution that their utility should be more intentionally weighed against increased costs in terms of energy and emissions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All the data from our study can be accessed via an interactive demo to carry out further exploration and analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bundle recommendation approaches offer users a set of related items on a particular topic.The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method utilizes contrastive learning to learn representations at both the bundle and item levels.However, due to the inherent difference between the bundle-level and item-level preferences, the item-level representations may not receive sufficient information from the bundle affiliations to make accurate predictions.In this paper, we propose a novel approach EBRec, short of Enhanced Bundle Recommendation, which incorporates two enhanced modules to explore inherent item-level bundle representations.First, we propose to incorporate the bundle-user-item (B-U-I) high-order correlations to explore more collaborative information, thus to enhance the previous bundle representation that solely relies on the bundle-item affiliation information.Second, we further enhance the B-U-I correlations by augmenting the observed user-item interactions with interactions generated from pre-trained models, thus improving the item-level bundle representations.We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, and the results justify the effectiveness of our approach as well as the two core modules.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/answermycode/EBRec. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing work has found that the prompt engineering heavily influences the performance of large language models (LLMs).Chain-of-thought (CoT), as a popular prompt engineering technique, prompted LLMs using in-context examples with reasoning steps.In current studies, the few-shot examples of CoT are generally handcrafted by humans.However, how the text style of in-context examples influence the outputs of LLMs still remains under-explored.This paper presents a novel and effective approach, named \textbf{AlignCoT}, to improve the reasoning capability of LLMs by aligning the in-context examples with the native style of LLMs.``Native'' refers to the inherent characteristic style of LLMs which can be probed by original zero-shot scenarios.AlignCoT is orthogonal to other prompt engineering methods, making it easy to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve the LLMs' performance.We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks.The empirical results demonstrate that our AlignCoTsignificantly improves performance over the carefully handcrafted in-context examples.For instance, with GPT-3.5-turbo, we observed a +2.5\% improvement on GSM8K.

                  <p>In the realm of large multi-modal models (LMMs), efficient modality alignment is crucial yet often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality image-text data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this bottleneck, we introduce the ShareGPT4V dataset, a pioneering large-scale resource featuring 1.2 million highly descriptive captions, which surpasses existing datasets in diversity and information content, covering world knowledge, object properties, spatial relationships, and aesthetic evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>Specifically, ShareGPT4V originates from a curated 100K high-quality captions collected from advanced GPT4-Vision and has been expanded to 1.2M with a superb caption model trained on this subset.ShareGPT4V first demonstrates its effectiveness for the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase, by substituting an equivalent quantity of detailed captions in existing SFT datasets with a subset of our high-quality captions, significantly enhancing the LMMs like LLaVA-7B, LLaVA-1.5-13B, and Qwen-VL-Chat-7B on the MME and MMBench benchmarks, with respective gains of 222.8/22.0/22.3 and 2.7/1.3/1.5.We further incorporate ShareGPT4V data into both the pre-training and SFT phases, obtaining ShareGPT4V-7B, a superior LMM based on a simple architecture that has remarkable performance across a majority of the multi-modal benchmarks.This project is available at https://ShareGPT4V.github.io to serve as a pivotal resource for advancing the LMMs community.</p>

                  <p>Cereal grain plays a crucial role in the human diet as a major source of essential nutrients.Grain Appearance Inspection (GAI) serves as an essential process to determine grain quality and facilitate grain circulation and processing.However, GAI is routinely performed manually by inspectors with cumbersome procedures, which poses a significant bottleneck in smart agriculture.   In this paper, we endeavor to develop an automated GAI system:AI4GrainInsp.By analyzing the distinctive characteristics of grain kernels, we formulate GAI as a ubiquitous problem: Anomaly Detection (AD), in which healthy and edible kernels are considered normal samples while damaged grains or unknown objects are regarded as anomalies.We further propose an AD model, called AD-GAI, which is trained using only normal samples yet can identify anomalies during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we customize a prototype device for data acquisition and create a large-scale dataset including 220K high-quality images of wheat and maize kernels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.842</span></span>Through extensive experiments, AD-GAI achieves considerable performance in comparison with advanced AD methods, and AI4GrainInsp has highly consistent performance compared to human experts and excels at inspection efficiency over 20x speedup.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, code and models will be released at https://github.com/hellodfan/AI4GrainInsp. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.873</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the growth of machine learning techniques, privacy of data of users has become a major concern.Most of the machine learning algorithms rely heavily on large amount of data which may be collected from various sources.Collecting these data yet maintaining privacy policies has become one of the most challenging tasks for the researchers.To combat this issue, researchers have introduced federated learning, where a prediction model is learnt by ensuring the privacy of data of clients data.However, the prevalent federated learning algorithms possess an accuracy and efficiency trade-off, especially for non-IID data.In this research, we propose a centralized, neural network-based federated learning system.The centralized algorithm incorporates micro-level parallel processing inspired by the traditional mini-batch algorithm where the client devices and the server handle the forward and backward propagation respectively.We also devise a semi-centralized version of our proposed algorithm.This algorithm takes advantage of edge computing for minimizing the load from the central server, where clients handle both the forward and backward propagation while sacrificing the overall train time to some extent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our proposed systems on five well-known benchmark datasets and achieve satisfactory performance in a reasonable time across various data distribution settings as compared to some existing benchmark algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span></p>

                  <p>Colonoscopy screening is the gold standard procedure for assessing abnormalities in the colon and rectum, such as ulcers and cancerous polyps.Measuring the abnormal mucosal area and its 3D reconstruction can help quantify the surveyed area and objectively evaluate disease burden.However, due to the complex topology of these organs and variable physical conditions, for example, lighting, large homogeneous texture, and image modality estimating distance from the camera aka depth) is highly challenging.Moreover, most colonoscopic video acquisition is monocular, making the depth estimation a non-trivial problem.While methods in computer vision for depth estimation have been proposed and advanced on natural scene datasets, the efficacy of these techniques has not been widely quantified on colonoscopy datasets.As the colonic mucosa has several low-texture regions that are not well pronounced, learning representations from an auxiliary task can improve salient feature extraction, allowing estimation of accurate camera depths.In this work, we propose to develop a novel multi-task learning (MTL) approach with a shared encoder and two decoders, namely a surface normal decoder and a depth estimator decoder.Our depth estimator incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance global context awareness.We leverage the surface normal prediction to improve geometric feature extraction.Also, we apply a cross-task consistency loss among the two geometrically related tasks, surface normal and camera depth.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate an improvement of 14.17% on relative error and 10.4% improvement on $\delta_{1}$ accuracy over the most accurate baseline state-of-the-art BTS approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All experiments are conducted on a recently released C3VD dataset; thus, we provide a first benchmark of state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span></p>

The methodology is experimentally assessed on two feature selection tasks adopting a GA-based MOFS with six objectives (number of selected features, balanced accuracy, F1-Score, variance inflation factor, statistical parity, and equalised odds).The results show the added value of the methodology in the selection of the final subset of features.</p>

                  <p>We revisit the problem of estimating the profile (also known as the rarity) in the data stream model.Given a sequence of $m$ elements from a universe of size $n$, its profile is a vector $\phi$ whose $i$-th entry $\phi_i$ represents the number of distinct elements that appear in the stream exactly $i$ times.A classic paper by Datar and Muthukrishan from 2002 gave an algorithm which estimates any entry $\phi_i$ up to an additive error of $\pm \epsilon D$ using $O(1/\epsilon^2 (\log n + \log m))$ bits of space, where $D$ is the number of distinct elements in the stream.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we considerably improve on this result by designing an algorithm which simultaneously estimates many coordinates of the profile vector $\phi$ up to small overall error. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>We give an algorithm which, with constant probability, produces an estimated profile $\hat\phi$ with the following guarantees in terms of space and estimation error:   -For any constant $\tau$, with $O(1 / \epsilon^2 + \log n)$ bits of space, $\sum_{i=1}^\tau |\phi_i - \hat\phi_i| \leq \epsilon D$.   - With $O(1/ \epsilon^2\log (1/\epsilon) + \log n + \log \log m)$ bits of space, $\sum_{i=1}^m |\phi_i - \hat\phi_i| \leq \epsilon m$.   In addition to bounding the error across multiple coordinates, our space bounds separate the terms that depend on $1/\epsilon$ and those that depend on $n$ and $m$. We prove matching lower bounds on space in both regimes.Application of our profile estimation algorithm gives estimates within error $\pm \epsilon D$ of several symmetric functions of frequencies in $O(1/\epsilon^2 + \log n)$ bits.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This generalizes space-optimal algorithms for the distinct elements problems to other problems including estimating the Huber and Tukey losses as well as frequency cap statistics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span></p>

                  <p>Artificial Intelligence for Science (AI4S) is an emerging research field that utilizes machine learning advancements to tackle complex scientific computational issues, aiming to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy.However, the data-driven nature of AI4S lacks the correctness or accuracy assurances of conventional scientific computing, posing challenges when deploying AI4S models in real-world applications.To mitigate these, more comprehensive benchmarking procedures are needed to better understand AI4S models.This paper introduces a novel benchmarking approach, known as structural interpretation, which addresses two key requirements: identifying the trusted operating range in the problem space and tracing errors back to their computational components.This method partitions both the problem and metric spaces, facilitating a structural exploration of these spaces.The practical utility and effectiveness of structural interpretation are illustrated through its application to three distinct AI4S workloads: machine-learning force fields (MLFF), jet tagging, and precipitation nowcasting.The benchmarks effectively model the trusted operating range, trace errors, and reveal novel perspectives for refining the model, training process, and data sampling strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work is part of the SAIBench project, an AI4S benchmarking suite. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>The optimization of traffic signal control (TSC) is critical for an efficient transportation system.In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have emerged as a popular approach for TSC and show promising results for highly adaptive control.However, existing RL-based methods suffer from notably poor real-world applicability and hardly have any successful deployments.The reasons for such failures are mostly due to the reliance on over-idealized traffic simulators for policy optimization, as well as using unrealistic fine-grained state observations and reward signals that are not directly obtainable from real-world sensors.In this paper, we propose a fully Data-Driven and simulator-free framework for realistic Traffic Signal Control (D2TSC).Specifically, we combine well-established traffic flow theory with machine learning to construct a reward inference model to infer the reward signals from coarse-grained traffic data.With the inferred rewards, we further propose a sample-efficient offline RL method to enable direct signal control policy learning from historical offline datasets of real-world intersections.To evaluate our approach, we collect historical traffic data from a real-world intersection, and develop a highly customized simulation environment that strictly follows real data characteristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approach achieves superior performance over conventional and offline RL baselines, and also enjoys much better real-world applicability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video-based large language models (Video-LLMs) have been recently introduced, targeting both fundamental improvements in perception and comprehension, and a diverse range of user inquiries.In pursuit of the ultimate goal of achieving artificial general intelligence, a truly intelligent Video-LLM model should not only see and understand the surroundings, but also possess human-level commonsense, and make well-informed decisions for the users.To guide the development of such a model, the establishment of a robust and comprehensive evaluation system becomes crucial.To this end, this paper proposes \textit{Video-Bench}, a new comprehensive benchmark along with a toolkit specifically designed for evaluating Video-LLMs.The benchmark comprises 10 meticulously crafted tasks, evaluating the capabilities of Video-LLMs across three distinct levels: Video-exclusive Understanding, Prior Knowledge-based Question-Answering, and Comprehension and Decision-making.In addition, we introduce an automatic toolkit tailored to process model outputs for various tasks, facilitating the calculation of metrics and generating convenient final scores.We evaluate 8 representative Video-LLMs using \textit{Video-Bench}.The findings reveal that current Video-LLMs still fall considerably short of achieving human-like comprehension and analysis of real-world videos, offering valuable insights for future research directions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The benchmark and toolkit are available at: \url{https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Video-Bench}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

                  <p>Data sampling is an effective method to improve the training speed of neural networks, with recent results demonstrating that it can even break the neural scaling laws.These results critically rely on high-quality scores to estimate the importance of an input to the network.We observe that there are two dominant strategies: static sampling, where the scores are determined before training, and dynamic sampling, where the scores can depend on the model weights.Static algorithms are computationally inexpensive but less effective than their dynamic counterparts, which can cause end-to-end slowdown due to their need to explicitly compute losses.To address this problem, we propose a novel sampling distribution based on nonparametric kernel regression that learns an effective importance score as the neural network trains.However, nonparametric regression models are too computationally expensive to accelerate end-to-end training.Therefore, we develop an efficient sketch-based approximation to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator.Using recent techniques from high-dimensional statistics and randomized algorithms, we prove that our Nadaraya-Watson sketch approximates the estimator with exponential convergence guarantees.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our sampling algorithm outperforms the baseline in terms of wall-clock time and accuracy on four datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained substantial attention across diverse application domains and theoretical investigations.Existing literature on RL theory largely focuses on risk-neutral settings where the decision-maker learns to maximize the expected cumulative reward.However, in practical scenarios such as portfolio management and e-commerce recommendations, decision-makers often persist in heterogeneous risk preferences subject to outcome uncertainties, which can not be well-captured by the risk-neural framework.Incorporating these preferences can be approached through utility theory, yet the development of risk-sensitive RL under general utility functions remains an open question for theoretical exploration.   In this paper, we consider a scenario where the decision-maker seeks to optimize a general utility function of the cumulative reward in the framework of a Markov decision process (MDP).To facilitate the Dynamic Programming Principle and Bellman equation, we enlarge the state space with an additional dimension that accounts for the cumulative reward.We propose a discretized approximation scheme to the MDP under enlarged state space, which is tractable and key for algorithmic design.We then propose a modified value iteration algorithm that employs an epsilon-covering over the space of cumulative reward.When a simulator is accessible, our algorithm efficiently learns a near-optimal policy with guaranteed sample complexity.In the absence of a simulator, our algorithm, designed with an upper-confidence-bound exploration approach, identifies a near-optimal policy while ensuring a guaranteed regret bound.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For both algorithms, we match the theoretical lower bounds for the risk-neutral setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

In this paper we are proposing an architecture for several chatbots that can interact via a command and control channel, requesting actions for other bots and collecting the replies in order to pass them to the user.The chatbot infrastructure is lightweight, and it can use public (but not publicly viewable) infrastructure providing an easy way to start a project with it.</p>

                  <p>We introduce PoseGPT, a framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and reason about 3D human poses from images or textual descriptions.Our work is motivated by the human ability to intuitively understand postures from a single image or a brief description, a process that intertwines image interpretation, world knowledge, and an understanding of body language.Traditional human pose estimation methods, whether image-based or text-based, often lack holistic scene comprehension and nuanced reasoning, leading to a disconnect between visual data and its real-world implications.PoseGPT addresses these limitations by embedding SMPL poses as a distinct signal token within a multi-modal LLM, enabling direct generation of 3D body poses from both textual and visual inputs.This approach not only simplifies pose prediction but also empowers LLMs to apply their world knowledge in reasoning about human poses, fostering two advanced tasks: speculative pose generation and reasoning about pose estimation.These tasks involve reasoning about humans to generate 3D poses from subtle text queries, possibly accompanied by images.We establish benchmarks for these tasks, moving beyond traditional 3D pose generation and estimation methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that PoseGPT outperforms existing multimodal LLMs and task-sepcific methods on these newly proposed tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>Furthermore, PoseGPT's ability to understand and generate 3D human poses based on complex reasoning opens new directions in human pose analysis.</p>

                  <p>Over the past few years, silicon photonics-based computing has emerged as a promising alternative to CMOS-based computing for Deep Neural Networks (DNN).Unfortunately, the non-linear operations and the high-precision requirements of DNNs make it extremely challenging to design efficient silicon photonics-based systems for DNN inference and training.Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is an emerging, brain-inspired machine learning technique that enjoys several advantages over existing DNNs, including being lightweight, requiring low-precision operands, and being robust to noise introduced by the nonidealities in the hardware.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For HDC, computing in-memory (CiM) approaches have been widely used, as CiM reduces the data transfer cost if the operands can fit into the memory. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, inefficient multi-bit operations, high write latency, and low endurance make CiM ill-suited for HDC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>On the other hand, the existing electro-photonic DNN accelerators are inefficient for HDC because they are specifically optimized for matrix multiplication in DNNs and consume a lot of power with high-precision data converters.

                  <p>In this work, we present a novel method to tackle the token generation challenge in Vision Language Models (VLMs) for video and image understanding, called LLaMA-VID.Current VLMs, while proficient in tasks like image captioning and visual question answering, face computational burdens when processing long videos due to the excessive visual tokens.LLaMA-VID addresses this issue by representing each frame with two distinct tokens, namely context token and content token.The context token encodes the overall image context based on user input, whereas the content token encapsulates visual cues in each frame.This dual-token strategy significantly reduces the overload of long videos while preserving critical information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Generally, LLaMA-VID empowers existing frameworks to support hour-long videos and pushes their upper limit with an extra context token. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>It is proved to surpass previous methods on most of video- or image-based benchmarks.Code is available https://github.com/dvlab-research/LLaMA-VID}{https://github.com/dvlab-research/LLaMA-VID</p>

                  <p>The emergence of open-source ML libraries such as TensorFlow and Google Auto ML has enabled developers to harness state-of-the-art ML algorithms with minimal overhead.However, during this accelerated ML development process, said developers may often make sub-optimal design and implementation decisions, leading to the introduction of technical debt that, if not addressed promptly, can have a significant impact on the quality of the ML-based software.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Developers frequently acknowledge these sub-optimal design and development choices through code comments during software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>These comments, which often highlight areas requiring additional work or refinement in the future, are known as self-admitted technical debt (SATD).This paper aims to investigate SATD in ML code by analyzing 318 open-source ML projects across five domains, along with 318 non-ML projects.We detected SATD in source code comments throughout the different project snapshots, conducted a manual analysis of the identified SATD sample to comprehend the nature of technical debt in the ML code, and performed a survival analysis of the SATD to understand the evolution of such debts.We observed: i) Machine learning projects have a median percentage of SATD that is twice the median percentage of SATD in non-machine learning projects.ii) ML pipeline components for data preprocessing and model generation logic are more susceptible to debt than model validation and deployment components.iii) SATDs appear in ML projects earlier in the development process compared to non-ML projects.iv) Long-lasting SATDs are typically introduced during extensive code changes that span multiple files exhibiting low complexity.</p>
