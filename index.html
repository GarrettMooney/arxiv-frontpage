                  <p>Visibility in hazy nighttime scenes is frequently reduced by multiple factors, including low light, intense glow, light scattering, and the presence of multicolored light sources.Existing nighttime dehazing methods often struggle with handling glow or low-light conditions, resulting in either excessively dark visuals or unsuppressed glow outputs.In this paper, we enhance the visibility from a single nighttime haze image by suppressing glow and enhancing low-light regions.To handle glow effects, our framework learns from the rendered glow pairs.Specifically, a light source aware network is proposed to detect light sources of night images, followed by the APSF (Angular Point Spread Function)-guided glow rendering.Our framework is then trained on the rendered images, resulting in glow suppression.Moreover, we utilize gradient-adaptive convolution, to capture edges and textures in hazy scenes.By leveraging extracted edges and textures, we enhance the contrast of the scene without losing important structural details.To boost low-light intensity, our network learns an attention map, then adjusted by gamma correction.This attention has high values on low-light regions and low values on haze and glow regions.Extensive evaluation on real nighttime haze images, demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a PSNR of 30.72dB, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 14$\%$ on GTA5 nighttime haze dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data and code is available at: \url{https://github.com/jinyeying/nighttime_dehaze}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current captioning approaches tend to generate correct but "generic" descriptions that lack real-world knowledge, e.g., named entities and contextual information.Considering that Vision-Language Pre-Training (VLP) models master massive such knowledge from large-scale web-harvested data, it is promising to utilize the generalizability of VLP models to incorporate knowledge into image descriptions.However, using VLP models faces challenges: zero-shot inference suffers from knowledge hallucination that leads to low-quality descriptions, but the generic bias in downstream task fine-tuning hinders the VLP model from expressing knowledge.To address these concerns, we propose a simple yet effective method called Knowledge-guided Replay (K-Replay), which enables the retention of pre-training knowledge during fine-tuning.Our approach consists of two parts: (1) a knowledge prediction task on automatically collected replay exemplars to continuously awaken the VLP model's memory about knowledge, thus preventing the model from collapsing into the generic pattern; (2) a knowledge distillation constraint to improve the faithfulness of generated descriptions hence alleviating the knowledge hallucination.To evaluate knowledge-enhanced descriptions, we construct a novel captioning benchmark KnowCap, containing knowledge of landmarks, famous brands, special foods and movie characters.Experimental results show that our approach effectively incorporates knowledge into descriptions, outperforming strong VLP baseline by 20.9 points (78.7->99.6) in CIDEr score and 20.5 percentage points (34.0%->54.5%) in knowledge recognition accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data is available at https://github.com/njucckevin/KnowCap. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span></p>

                  <p>The loudness war, an ongoing phenomenon in the music industry characterized by the increasing final loudness of music while reducing its dynamic range, has been a controversial topic for decades.Music mastering engineers have used limiters to heavily compress and make music louder, which can induce ear fatigue and hearing loss in listeners.In this paper, we introduce music de-limiter networks that estimate uncompressed music from heavily compressed signals.Inspired by the principle of a limiter, which performs sample-wise gain reduction of a given signal, we propose the framework of sample-wise gain inversion (SGI).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also present the musdb-XL-train dataset, consisting of 300k segments created by applying a commercial limiter plug-in for training real-world friendly de-limiter networks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>Our proposed de-limiter network achieves excellent performance with a scale-invariant source-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) of 23.8 dB in reconstructing musdb-HQ from musdb- XL data, a limiter-applied version of musdb-HQ.The training data, codes, and model weights are available in our repository (https://github.com/jeonchangbin49/De-limiter).</p>

                  <p>Digital preservation of Cultural Heritage (CH) sites is crucial to protect them against damage from natural disasters or human activities.Creating 3D models of CH sites has become a popular method of digital preservation thanks to advancements in computer vision and photogrammetry.However, the process is time-consuming, expensive, and typically requires specialized equipment and expertise, posing challenges in resource-limited developing countries.Additionally, the lack of an open repository for 3D models hinders research and public engagement with their heritage.To address these issues, we propose Tirtha, a web platform for crowdsourcing images of CH sites and creating their 3D models.Tirtha utilizes state-of-the-art Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques.It is modular, extensible and cost-effective, allowing for the incorporation of new techniques as photogrammetry advances.Tirtha is accessible through a web interface at https://tirtha.niser.ac.in and can be deployed on-premise or in a cloud environment.In our case studies, we demonstrate the pipeline's effectiveness by creating 3D models of temples in Odisha, India, using crowdsourced images.These models are available for viewing, interaction, and download on the Tirtha website.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work aims to provide a dataset of crowdsourced images and 3D reconstructions for research in computer vision, heritage conservation, and related domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.909</span></span>Overall, Tirtha is a step towards democratizing digital preservation, primarily in resource-limited developing countries.</p>

                  <p>Multi-spectral image stitching leverages the complementarity between infrared and visible images to generate a robust and reliable wide field-of-view (FOV) scene.The primary challenge of this task is to explore the relations between multi-spectral images for aligning and integrating multi-view scenes.Capitalizing on the strengths of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in modeling feature relationships, we propose a spatial graph reasoning based multi-spectral image stitching method that effectively distills the deformation and integration of multi-spectral images across different viewpoints.To accomplish this, we embed multi-scale complementary features from the same view position into a set of nodes.The correspondence across different views is learned through powerful dense feature embeddings, where both inter- and intra-correlations are developed to exploit cross-view matching and enhance inner feature disparity.By introducing long-range coherence along spatial and channel dimensions, the complementarity of pixel relations and channel interdependencies aids in the reconstruction of aligned multi-view features, generating informative and reliable wide FOV scenes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we release a challenging dataset named ChaMS, comprising both real-world and synthetic sets with significant parallax, providing a new option for comprehensive evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.819</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-arts.</p>

                  <p>Despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs) and their variants, e.g., LLaMA and Vicuna, they remain significantly limited in performing higher-level tasks, such as following human instructions to use external tools (APIs).This is because current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks instead of the tool-use domain.This is in contrast to state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, which have demonstrated excellent tool-use capabilities but are unfortunately closed source.To facilitate tool-use capabilities within open-source LLMs, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework of data construction, model training and evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, which is created automatically using ChatGPT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>Specifically, we collect 16,464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories from RapidAPI Hub, then prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse human instructions involving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios.Finally, we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API calls) for each instruction.To make the searching process more efficient, we develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree (DFSDT), enabling LLMs to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space.We show that DFSDT significantly enhances the planning and reasoning capabilities of LLMs.For efficient tool-use assessment, we develop an automatic evaluator: ToolEval.We fine-tune LLaMA on ToolBench and obtain ToolLLaMA.Our ToolEval reveals that ToolLLaMA demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen APIs, and exhibits comparable performance to ChatGPT.To make the pipeline more practical, we devise a neural API retriever to recommend appropriate APIs for each instruction, negating the need for manual API selection.</p>

                  <p>Retriever-augmented instruction-following models are attractive alternatives to fine-tuned approaches for information-seeking tasks such as question answering (QA).By simply prepending retrieved documents in its input along with an instruction, these models can be adapted to various information domains and tasks without additional fine-tuning.While the model responses tend to be natural and fluent, the additional verbosity makes traditional QA evaluation metrics such as exact match (EM) and F1 unreliable for accurately quantifying model performance.   In this work, we investigate the performance of instruction-following models across three information-seeking QA tasks.We use both automatic and human evaluation to evaluate these models along two dimensions: 1) how well they satisfy the user's information need (correctness), and 2) whether they produce a response based on the provided knowledge (faithfulness).Guided by human evaluation and analysis, we highlight the shortcomings of traditional metrics for both correctness and faithfulness.We then propose simple token-overlap based and model-based metrics that reflect the true performance of these models.Our analysis reveals that instruction-following models are competitive, and sometimes even outperform fine-tuned models for correctness.However, these models struggle to stick to the provided knowledge and often hallucinate in their responses.We hope our work encourages a more holistic evaluation of instruction-following models for QA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data is available at https://github.com/McGill-NLP/instruct-qa <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a well-known method for exposing bugs/vulnerabilities in software systems.Popular fuzzers, such as AFL, use a biased random search over the domain of program inputs, where 100s or 1000s of inputs (test cases) are executed per second in order to expose bugs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If a bug is discovered, it can either be fixed manually by the developer or fixed automatically using an Automated Program Repair (APR) tool. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>Like fuzzing, many existing APR tools are search-based, but over the domain of patches rather than inputs.   In this paper, we propose search-based program repair as patch-level fuzzing.The basic idea is to adapt a fuzzer (AFL) to fuzz over the patch space rather than the input space.Thus we use a patch-space fuzzer to explore a patch space, while using a traditional input level fuzzer to rule out patch candidates and help in patch selection.To improve the throughput, we propose a compilation-free patch validation methodology, where we execute the original (unpatched) program natively, then selectively interpret only the specific patched statements and expressions.Since this avoids (re)compilation, we show that compilation-free patch validation can achieve a similar throughput as input-level fuzzing (100s or 1000s of execs/sec).We show that patch-level fuzzing and input-level fuzzing can be combined, for a co-exploration of both spaces in order to find better quality patches.Such a collaboration between input-level fuzzing and patch-level fuzzing is then employed to search over candidate fix locations, as well as patch candidates in each fix location.</p>

                  <p>Performance issues permeate large-scale cloud service systems, which can lead to huge revenue losses.To ensure reliable performance, it's essential to accurately identify and localize these issues using service monitoring metrics.Given the complexity and scale of modern cloud systems, this task can be challenging and may require extensive expertise and resources beyond the capacity of individual humans.Some existing methods tackle this problem by analyzing each metric independently to detect anomalies.However, this could incur overwhelming alert storms that are difficult for engineers to diagnose manually.To pursue better performance, not only the temporal patterns of metrics but also the correlation between metrics (i.e., relational patterns) should be considered, which can be formulated as a multivariate metrics anomaly detection problem.However, most of the studies fall short of extracting these two types of features explicitly.Moreover, there exist some unlabeled anomalies mixed in the training data, which may hinder the detection performance.To address these limitations, we propose the Relational- Temporal Anomaly Detection Model (RTAnomaly) that combines the relational and temporal information of metrics.RTAnomaly employs a graph attention layer to learn the dependencies among metrics, which will further help pinpoint the anomalous metrics that may cause the anomaly effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we exploit the concept of positive unlabeled learning to address the issue of potential anomalies in the training data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>To evaluate our method, we conduct experiments on a public dataset and two industrial datasets.RTAnomaly outperforms all the baseline models by achieving an average F1 score of 0.929 and Hit@3 of 0.920, demonstrating its superiority.</p>

This paper presents the first study on the problem of assembly clone search with unseen architectures and libraries.We propose incorporating human common knowledge through large-scale pre-trained natural language models, in the form of transfer learning, into current learning-based approaches for assembly clone search.Transfer learning can aid in addressing the limitations of the existing approaches, as it can bring in broader knowledge from human experts in assembly code.We further address the sequence limit issue by proposing a reinforcement learning agent to remove unnecessary and redundant tokens.Coupled with a new Variational Information Bottleneck learning strategy, the proposed system minimizes the reliance on potential indicators of architectures and optimization settings, for a better generalization of unseen architectures.We simulate the unseen architecture clone search scenarios and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) has become very popular since it enables clients to train a joint model collaboratively without sharing their private data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, FL has been shown to be susceptible to backdoor and inference attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>While in the former, the adversary injects manipulated updates into the aggregation process; the latter leverages clients' local models to deduce their private data.Contemporary solutions to address the security concerns of FL are either impractical for real-world deployment due to high-performance overheads or are tailored towards addressing specific threats, for instance, privacy-preserving aggregation or backdoor defenses.Given these limitations, our research delves into the advantages of harnessing the FPGA-based computing paradigm to overcome performance bottlenecks of software-only solutions while mitigating backdoor and inference attacks.We utilize FPGA-based enclaves to address inference attacks during the aggregation process of FL.We adopt an advanced backdoor-aware aggregation algorithm on the FPGA to counter backdoor attacks.We implemented and evaluated our method on Xilinx VMK-180, yielding a significant speed-up of around 300 times on the IoT-Traffic dataset and more than 506 times on the CIFAR-10 dataset.</p>

                  <p>Consensus algorithms facilitate agreement on and resolution of blockchain functions, such as smart contracts and transactions.Ethereum uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which depends on financial incentives to ensure that validators perform certain duties and do not act maliciously.Should a validator attempt to defraud the system, legitimate validators will identify this and then staked cryptocurrency is `burned' through a process of slashing.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we show that an attacker who has compromised a set of validators could threaten to perform malicious actions that would result in slashing and thus, hold those validators to ransom. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We use game theory to study how an attacker can coerce payment from a victim, for example by deploying a smart contract to provide a root of trust shared between attacker and victim during the extortion process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>Our game theoretic model finds that it is in the interests of the validators to fully pay the ransom due to a lack of systemic protections for validators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Financial risk is solely placed on the victim during such an attack, with no mitigations available to them aside from capitulation (payment of ransom) in many scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such attacks could be disruptive to Ethereum and, likely, to many other PoS networks, if public trust in the validator system is eroded. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span>We also discuss and evaluate potential mitigation measures arising from our analysis of the game theoretic model.</p>

                  <p>Images are loaded with semantic information that pertains to real-world ontologies: dog breeds share mammalian similarities, food pictures are often depicted in domestic environments, and so on.However, when training machine learning models for image classification, the relative similarities amongst object classes are commonly paired with one-hot-encoded labels.According to this logic, if an image is labelled as 'spoon', then 'tea-spoon' and 'shark' are equally wrong in terms of training loss.To overcome this limitation, we explore the integration of additional goals that reflect ontological and semantic knowledge, improving model interpretability and trustworthiness.We suggest a generic approach that allows to derive an additional loss term starting from any kind of semantic information about the classification label.First, we show how to apply our approach to ontologies and word embeddings, and discuss how the resulting information can drive a supervised learning process.Second, we use our semantically enriched loss to train image classifiers, and analyse the trade-offs between accuracy, mistake severity, and learned internal representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we discuss how this approach can be further exploited in terms of explainability and adversarial robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span>Code repository: https://github.com/S1M0N38/semantic-encodings</p>
