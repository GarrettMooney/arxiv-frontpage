                  <p>3D neural implicit representations play a significant component in many robotic applications.However, reconstructing neural radiance fields (NeRF) from realistic event data remains a challenge due to the sparsities and the lack of information when only event streams are available.In this paper, we utilize motion, geometry, and density priors behind event data to impose strong physical constraints to augment NeRF training.The proposed novel pipeline can directly benefit from those priors to reconstruct 3D scenes without additional inputs.Moreover, we present a novel density-guided patch-based sampling strategy for robust and efficient learning, which not only accelerates training procedures but also conduces to expressions of local geometries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More importantly, we establish the first large dataset for event-based 3D reconstruction, which contains 101 objects with various materials and geometries, along with the groundtruth of images and depth maps for all camera viewpoints, which significantly facilitates other research in the related fields. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.903</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/Mercerai/PAEv3d. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span></p>

                  <p>Point-based object localization (POL), which pursues high-performance object sensing under low-cost data annotation, has attracted increased attention.However, the point annotation mode inevitably introduces semantic variance due to the inconsistency of annotated points.Existing POL heavily rely on strict annotation rules, which are difficult to define and apply, to handle the problem.In this study, we propose coarse point refinement (CPR), which to our best knowledge is the first attempt to alleviate semantic variance from an algorithmic perspective.CPR reduces the semantic variance by selecting a semantic centre point in a neighbourhood region to replace the initial annotated point.Furthermore, We design a sampling region estimation module to dynamically compute a sampling region for each object and use a cascaded structure to achieve end-to-end optimization.We further integrate a variance regularization into the structure to concentrate the predicted scores, yielding CPR++.We observe that CPR++ can obtain scale information and further reduce the semantic variance in a global region, thus guaranteeing high-performance object localization.Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets validate the effectiveness of both CPR and CPR++.We hope our work can inspire more research on designing algorithms rather than annotation rules to address the semantic variance problem in POL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code will be public at github.com/ucas-vg/PointTinyBenchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span></p>

                  <p>CONTEXT The R programming language has a huge and active community, especially in the area of statistical computing.Its interpreted nature allows for several interesting constructs, like the manipulation of functions at run-time, that hinder the static analysis of R programs.At the same time, there is a lack of existing research regarding how these features, or even the R language as a whole are used in practice.OBJECTIVEIn this paper, we conduct a large-scale, static analysis of more than 50 million lines of real-world R programs and packages to identify their characteristics and the features that are actually used.Moreover, we compare the similarities and differences between the scripts of R users and the implementations of package authors.We provide insights for static analysis tools like the lintr package as well as potential interpreter optimizations and uncover areas for future research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>METHOD We analyze 4230 R scripts submitted alongside publications and the sources of 19450 CRAN packages for over 350000 R files, collecting and summarizing quantitative information for features of interest. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.869</span></span>RESULTS We find a high frequency of name-based indexing operations, assignments, and loops, but a low frequency for most of R's reflective functions.Furthermore, we find neither testing functions nor many calls to R's foreign function interface (FFI) in the publication submissions.CONCLUSION R scripts and package sources differ, for example, in their size, the way they include other packages, and their usage of R's reflective capabilities.We provide features that are used frequently and should be prioritized by static analysis tools, like operator assignments, function calls, and certain reflective functions like load.</p>

                  <p>Multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) is a rapidly evolving field, where significant progress, particularly in image-text pairing, has been made through advanced representation learning and cross-modality alignment research.However, current benchmarks for evaluating MMIR performance in image-text pairing within the scientific domain show a notable gap, where chart and table images described in scholarly language usually do not play a significant role.To bridge this gap, we develop a specialised scientific MMIR (SciMMIR) benchmark by leveraging open-access paper collections to extract data relevant to the scientific domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This benchmark comprises 530K meticulously curated image-text pairs, extracted from figures and tables with detailed captions in scientific documents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.885</span></span>We further annotate the image-text pairs with two-level subset-subcategory hierarchy annotations to facilitate a more comprehensive evaluation of the baselines.We conducted zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations on prominent multi-modal image-captioning and visual language models, such as CLIP and BLIP.Our analysis offers critical insights for MMIR in the scientific domain, including the impact of pre-training and fine-tuning settings and the influence of the visual and textual encoders.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All our data and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/Wusiwei0410/SciMMIR. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span></p>

                  <p>Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (DocRTE) is a fundamental task in information systems that aims to simultaneously extract entities with semantic relations from a document.Existing methods heavily rely on a substantial amount of fully labeled data.However, collecting and annotating data for newly emerging relations is time-consuming and labor-intensive.Recent advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, exhibit impressive long-text generation capabilities, inspiring us to explore an alternative approach for obtaining auto-labeled documents with new relations.In this paper, we propose a Zero-shot Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (ZeroDocRTE) framework, which generates labeled data by retrieval and denoising knowledge from LLMs, called GenRDK.Specifically, we propose a chain-of-retrieval prompt to guide ChatGPT to generate labeled long-text data step by step.To improve the quality of synthetic data, we propose a denoising strategy based on the consistency of cross-document knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging our denoised synthetic data, we proceed to fine-tune the LLaMA2-13B-Chat for extracting document-level relation triplets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>We perform experiments for both zero-shot document-level relation and triplet extraction on two public datasets.The experimental results illustrate that our GenRDK framework outperforms strong baselines.</p>

                  <p>Roadside unit (RSU) can significantly improve the safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication.Currently, the usage of a single RSU mainly focuses on real-time inference and V2X collaboration, while neglecting the potential value of the high-quality data collected by RSU sensors.Integrating the vast amounts of data from numerous RSUs can provide a rich source of data for model training.However, the absence of ground truth annotations and the difficulty of transmitting enormous volumes of data are two inevitable barriers to fully exploiting this hidden value.In this paper, we introduce FedRSU, an innovative federated learning framework for self-supervised scene flow estimation.In FedRSU, we present a recurrent self-supervision training paradigm, where for each RSU, the scene flow prediction of points at every timestamp can be supervised by its subsequent future multi-modality observation.Another key component of FedRSU is federated learning, where multiple devices collaboratively train an ML model while keeping the training data local and private.With the power of the recurrent self-supervised learning paradigm, FL is able to leverage innumerable underutilized data from RSU.To verify the FedRSU framework, we construct a large-scale multi-modality dataset RSU-SF.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset consists of 17 RSU clients, covering various scenarios, modalities, and sensor settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span>Based on RSU-SF, we show that FedRSU can greatly improve model performance in ITS and provide a comprehensive benchmark under diverse FL scenarios.To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first real-world LiDAR-camera multi-modal dataset and benchmark for the FL community.</p>

Additionally, we simply apply red teaming alignment to LLaVA-v1.5 with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) using RTVLM, and this bolsters the models' performance with 10% in RTVLM test set, 13% in MM-Hal, and without noticeable decline in MM-Bench, overpassing other LLaVA-based models with regular alignment data.This reveals that current open-sourced VLMs still lack red teaming alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets will be open-source. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Pain assessment in individuals with neurological conditions, especially those with limited self-report ability and altered facial expressions, presents challenges.Existing measures, relying on direct observation by caregivers, lack sensitivity and specificity.In cerebral palsy, pain is a common comorbidity and a reliable evaluation protocol is crucial.Thus, having an automatic system that recognizes facial expressions could be of enormous help when diagnosing pain in this type of patient.   Objectives: 1) to build a dataset of facial pain expressions in individuals with cerebral palsy, and 2) to develop an automated facial recognition system based on deep learning for pain assessment addressed to this population.   Methods: Ten neural networks were trained on three pain image databases, including the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database, the Multimodal Intensity Pain Dataset, and the Delaware Pain Database.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, a curated dataset (CPPAIN) was created, consisting of 109 preprocessed facial pain expression images from individuals with cerebral palsy, categorized by two physiotherapists using the Facial Action Coding System observational scale.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>Results: InceptionV3 exhibited promising performance on the CP-PAIN dataset, achieving an accuracy of 62.67% and an F1 score of 61.12%.Explainable artificial intelligence techniques revealed consistent essential features for pain identification across models.   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models for robust pain detection in populations with neurological conditions and communication disabilities.The creation of a larger dataset specific to cerebral palsy would further enhance model accuracy, offering a valuable tool for discerning subtle and idiosyncratic pain expressions.The insights gained could extend to other complex neurological conditions.</p>

This process was guided by our ontology and involved a thorough automatic and manual filtering process, yielding a set of 216 maths problems.We conducted comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs on MORE.The results show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions.This strongly suggests that current LLMs lack robust mathematical skills and deep reasoning abilities.This research not only identifies multiple gaps in the capabilities of current models, but also highlights multiple potential directions for future development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset will be made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/GSM8k_MORE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the rise in communication capacity, deep neural networks (DNN) for digital pre-distortion (DPD) to correct non-linearity in wideband power amplifiers (PAs) have become prominent.Yet, there is a void in open-source and measurement-setup-independent platforms for fast DPD exploration and objective DPD model comparison.This paper presents an open-source framework, OpenDPD, crafted in PyTorch, with an associated dataset for PA modeling and DPD learning.We introduce a Dense Gated Recurrent Unit (DGRU)-DPD, trained via a novel end-to-end learning architecture, outperforming previous DPD models on a digital PA DPA in the new digital transmitter (DTX) architecture with unconventional transfer characteristics compared to analog PAs.Measurements show our DGRU-DPD achieves an ACPR of -44.69/-44.47 dBc and an EVM of -35.22 dB for 200 MHz OFDM signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>OpenDPD code, datasets, and documentation are publicly available at https://github.com/lab-emi/OpenDPD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span></p>

                  <p>The evolution of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been significantly influenced by six core challenges (Koehn and Knowles, 2017), which have acted as benchmarks for progress in this field.This study revisits these challenges, offering insights into their ongoing relevance in the context of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): domain mismatch, amount of parallel data, rare word prediction, translation of long sentences, attention model as word alignment, and sub-optimal beam search.Our empirical findings indicate that LLMs effectively lessen the reliance on parallel data for major languages in the pretraining phase.Additionally, the LLM-based translation system significantly enhances the translation of long sentences that contain approximately 80 words and shows the capability to translate documents of up to 512 words.However, despite these significant improvements, the challenges of domain mismatch and prediction of rare words persist.While the challenges of word alignment and beam search, specifically associated with NMT, may not apply to LLMs, we identify three new challenges for LLMs in translation tasks: inference efficiency, translation of low-resource languages in the pretraining phase, and human-aligned evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets and models are released at https://github.com/pangjh3/LLM4MT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span></p>

                  <p>There are two common ways in which developers are incorporating proprietary and domain-specific data when building applications of Large Language Models (LLMs): Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-Tuning.RAG augments the prompt with the external data, while fine-Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself.However, the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood.In this paper, we propose a pipeline for fine-tuning and RAG, and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs, including Llama2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.Our pipeline consists of multiple stages, including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers, using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results.We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine-Tuning pipeline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p.when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further.In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%.Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.</p>

                  <p>Generating sufficient labeled data is a significant hurdle in the efficient execution of deep learning projects, especially in uncharted territories of image segmentation where labeling demands extensive time, unlike classification tasks.Our study confronts this challenge, operating in an environment constrained by limited hardware resources and the lack of extensive datasets or pre-trained models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the novel use of Inconsistency Masks (IM) to effectively filter uncertainty in image-pseudo-label pairs, substantially elevating segmentation quality beyond traditional semi-supervised learning techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>By integrating IM with other methods, we demonstrate remarkable binary segmentation performance on the ISIC 2018 dataset, starting with just 10% labeled data.Notably, three of our hybrid models outperform those trained on the fully labeled dataset.Our approach consistently achieves exceptional results across three additional datasets and shows further improvement when combined with other techniques.For comprehensive and robust evaluation, this paper includes an extensive analysis of prevalent semi-supervised learning strategies, all trained under identical starting conditions.The full code is available at: https://github.com/MichaelVorndran/InconsistencyMasks</p>

                  <p>Without human annotations, a typical Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection (UVAD) method needs to train two models that generate pseudo labels for each other.In previous work, the two models are closely entangled with each other, and it is not known how to upgrade their method without modifying their training framework significantly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, previous work usually adopts fixed thresholding to obtain pseudo labels, however the user-specified threshold is not reliable which inevitably introduces errors into the training process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>To alleviate these two problems, we propose a novel interleaved framework that alternately trains a One-Class Classification (OCC) model and a Weakly-Supervised (WS) model for UVAD.The OCC or WS models in our method can be easily replaced with other OCC or WS models, which facilitates our method to upgrade with the most recent developments in both fields.For handling the fixed thresholding problem, we break through the conventional cognitive boundary and propose a weighted OCC model that can be trained on both normal and abnormal data.We also propose an adaptive mechanism for automatically finding the optimal threshold for the WS model in a loose to strict manner.Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UVAD method outperforms previous approaches.</p>

                  <p>In an era where test-time adaptation methods increasingly rely on the nuanced manipulation of batch normalization (BN) parameters, one critical assumption often goes overlooked: that of independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>test batches with respect to unknown labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>This assumption culminates in biased estimates of BN statistics and jeopardizes system stability under non-i.i.d. conditions.This paper pioneers a departure from the i.i.d. paradigm by introducing a groundbreaking strategy termed "Un-Mixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics" (UnMix-TNS).UnMix-TNS re-calibrates the instance-wise statistics used to normalize each instance in a batch by mixing it with multiple unmixed statistics components, thus inherently simulating the i.i.d. environment.The key lies in our innovative online unmixing procedure, which persistently refines these statistics components by drawing upon the closest instances from an incoming test batch.Remarkably generic in its design, UnMix-TNS seamlessly integrates with an array of state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods and pre-trained architectures equipped with BN layers.Empirical evaluations corroborate the robustness of UnMix-TNS under varied scenarios ranging from single to continual and mixed domain shifts.UnMix-TNS stands out when handling test data streams with temporal correlation, including those with corrupted real-world non-i.i.d. streams, sustaining its efficacy even with minimal batch sizes and individual samples.Our results set a new standard for test-time adaptation, demonstrating significant improvements in both stability and performance across multiple benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Profile-guided optimizations rely on profile data for directing compilers to generate optimized code.To achieve the maximum performance boost, profile data needs to be collected on the same version of the binary that is being optimized.In practice however, there is typically a gap between the profile collection and the release, which makes a portion of the profile invalid for optimizations.This phenomenon is known as profile staleness, and it is a serious practical problem for data-center workloads both for compilers and binary optimizers.   In this paper we thoroughly study the staleness problem and propose the first practical solution for utilizing profiles collected on binaries built from several revisions behind the release.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our algorithm is developed and implemented in a mainstream open-source post-link optimizer, BOLT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An extensive evaluation on a variety of standalone benchmarks and production services indicates that the new method recovers up to $0.8$ of the maximum BOLT benefit, even when most of the input profile data is stale and would have been discarded by the optimizer otherwise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span></p>

                  <p>Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation has recently garnered considerable attention, where fine-tuning plays a key role in LLMs' adaptation.However, the cost of fine-tuning LLMs on rapidly expanding recommendation data limits their practical application.To address this challenge, few-shot fine-tuning offers a promising approach to quickly adapt LLMs to new recommendation data.We propose the task of data pruning for efficient LLM-based recommendation, aimed at identifying representative samples tailored for LLMs' few-shot fine-tuning.While coreset selection is closely related to the proposed task, existing coreset selection methods often rely on suboptimal heuristic metrics or entail costly optimization on large-scale recommendation data.   To tackle these issues, we introduce two objectives for the data pruning task in the context of LLM-based recommendation: 1) high accuracy aims to identify the influential samples that can lead to high overall performance; and 2) high efficiency underlines the low costs of the data pruning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To pursue the two objectives, we propose a novel data pruning method based on two scores, i.e., influence score and effort score, to efficiently identify the influential samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Particularly, the influence score is introduced to accurately estimate the influence of sample removal on the overall performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>To achieve low costs of the data pruning process, we use a small-sized surrogate model to replace LLMs to obtain the influence score.Considering the potential gap between the surrogate model and LLMs, we further propose an effort score to prioritize some hard samples specifically for LLMs.Empirical results on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.In particular, the proposed method uses only 2% samples to surpass the full data fine-tuning, reducing time costs by 97%.</p>

                  <p>Point-based object localization (POL), which pursues high-performance object sensing under low-cost data annotation, has attracted increased attention.However, the point annotation mode inevitably introduces semantic variance due to the inconsistency of annotated points.Existing POL heavily rely on strict annotation rules, which are difficult to define and apply, to handle the problem.In this study, we propose coarse point refinement (CPR), which to our best knowledge is the first attempt to alleviate semantic variance from an algorithmic perspective.CPR reduces the semantic variance by selecting a semantic centre point in a neighbourhood region to replace the initial annotated point.Furthermore, We design a sampling region estimation module to dynamically compute a sampling region for each object and use a cascaded structure to achieve end-to-end optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further integrate a variance regularization into the structure to concentrate the predicted scores, yielding CPR++. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>We observe that CPR++ can obtain scale information and further reduce the semantic variance in a global region, thus guaranteeing high-performance object localization.Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets validate the effectiveness of both CPR and CPR++.We hope our work can inspire more research on designing algorithms rather than annotation rules to address the semantic variance problem in POL.The dataset and code will be public at github.com/ucas-vg/PointTinyBenchmark.</p>

                  <p>Although significant efforts have been dedicated to aligning large language models (LLMs), red-teaming reports suggest that these carefully aligned LLMs could still be jailbroken through adversarial prompts, tuning, or decoding.Upon examining the jailbreaking vulnerability of aligned LLMs, we observe that the decoding distributions of jailbroken and aligned models differ only in the initial generations.This observation motivates us to propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, where adversaries can utilize smaller unsafe/aligned LLMs (e.g., 7B) to guide jailbreaking against significantly larger aligned LLMs (e.g., 70B).To jailbreak, one only needs to additionally decode two smaller LLMs once, which involves minimal computation and latency compared to decoding the larger LLMs.The efficacy of this attack is demonstrated through experiments conducted on five models from three different organizations.Our study reveals a previously unnoticed yet efficient way of jailbreaking, exposing an urgent safety issue that needs to be considered when aligning LLMs.As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code for replicating the method is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>Configuring the hybrid precoders and combiners in a millimeter wave (mmWave) multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is challenging in frequency selective channels.In this paper, we develop a system that uses compressive estimation on the uplink to configure precoders and combiners for the downlink (DL).In the first step, the base station (BS) simultaneously estimates the channels from all the mobile stations (MSs) on each subcarrier.To reduce the number of measurements required, compressed sensing techniques are developed that exploit common support on the different subcarriers.In the second step, exploiting reciprocity and the channel estimates, the base station designs hybrid precoders and combiners.Two algorithms are developed for this purpose, with different performance and complexity tradeoffs: 1) a factorization of the purely digital solution, and 2) an iterative hybrid design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive numerical experiments evaluate the proposed solutions comparing to state-of-the-art strategies, and illustrating design tradeoffs in overhead, complexity, and performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique that aligns language models closely with human-centric values.The initial phase of RLHF involves learning human values using a reward model from ranking data.It is observed that the performance of the reward model degrades after one epoch of training, and optimizing too much against the learned reward model eventually hinders the true objective.This paper delves into these issues, leveraging the theoretical insights to design improved reward learning algorithm termed 'Iterative Data Smoothing' (IDS).The core idea is that during each training epoch, we not only update the model with the data, but also update the date using the model, replacing hard labels with soft labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical findings highlight the superior performance of this approach over the traditional methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are difficult to fully fine-tune (e.g., with instructions or human feedback) due to their sheer number of parameters.A family of parameter-efficient sparse fine-tuning (SFT) methods have proven promising in terms of performance but their memory requirements increase proportionally to the size of the LLMs.In this work, we scale sparse fine-tuning to state-of-the-art LLMs like LLaMA 2 7B and 13B. At any given time, for a desired density level, we maintain an array of parameter indices and the deltas of these parameters relative to their pretrained values.We iterate among: (a) updating the active deltas, (b) pruning indices (based on the change of magnitude of their deltas) and (c) regrowth of indices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For regrowth, we explore two criteria based on either the accumulated gradients of a few candidate parameters or their approximate momenta estimated using the efficient SM3 optimizer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>We experiment with instruction-tuning of LLMs on standard dataset mixtures, finding that SFT is often superior to popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA (low-rank adaptation) in terms of performance and comparable in terms of run time.We additionally show that SFT is compatible with both quantization and efficient optimizers, to facilitate scaling to ever-larger model sizes.We release the code for SFT at https://github.com/AlanAnsell/peft and for the instruction-tuning experiments at https://github.com/ducdauge/sft-llm.</p>

                  <p>Improving sample efficiency is central to Reinforcement Learning (RL), especially in environments where the rewards are sparse.Some recent approaches have proposed to specify reward functions as manually designed or learned reward structures whose integrations in the RL algorithms are claimed to significantly improve the learning efficiency.Manually designed reward structures can suffer from inaccuracy and existing automatically learning methods are often computationally intractable for complex tasks.The integration of inaccurate or partial reward structures in RL algorithms fail to learn optimal policies.In this work, we propose an RL algorithm that can automatically structure the reward function for sample efficiency, given a set of labels that signify subtasks.Given such minimal knowledge about the task, we train a high-level policy that selects optimal sub-tasks in each state together with a low-level policy that efficiently learns to complete each sub-task.We evaluate our algorithm in a variety of sparse-reward environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiment results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-art baselines as the difficulty of the task increases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present an approach for the data-driven modeling of nonlinear viscoelastic materials at small strains which is based on physics-augmented neural networks (NNs) and requires only stress and strain paths for training.The model is built on the concept of generalized standard materials and is therefore thermodynamically consistent by construction.It consists of a free energy and a dissipation potential, which can be either expressed by the components of their tensor arguments or by a suitable set of invariants.The two potentials are described by fully/partially input convex neural networks.For training of the NN model by paths of stress and strain, an efficient and flexible training method based on a recurrent cell, particularly a long short-term memory cell, is developed to automatically generate the internal variable(s) during the training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method is benchmarked and thoroughly compared with existing approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span>These include a method that obtains the internal variable by integrating the evolution equation over the entire sequence, while the other method uses an an auxiliary feedforward neural network for the internal variable(s).Databases for training are generated by using a conventional nonlinear viscoelastic reference model, where 3D and 2D plane strain data with either ideal or noisy stresses are generated.The coordinate-based and the invariant-based formulation are compared and the advantages of the latter are demonstrated.Afterwards, the invariant-based model is calibrated by applying the three training methods using ideal or noisy stress data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All methods yield good results, but differ in computation time and usability for large data sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>The presented training method based on a recurrent cell turns out to be particularly robust and widely applicable and thus represents a promising approach for the calibration of other types of models as well.</p>

                  <p>Blockchain performance has historically faced challenges posed by the throughput limitations of consensus algorithms.Recent breakthroughs in research have successfully alleviated these constraints by introducing a modular architecture that decouples consensus from execution.The move toward independent optimization of the consensus layer has shifted attention to the execution layer.   While concurrent transaction execution is a promising solution for increasing throughput, practical challenges persist.Its effectiveness varies based on the workloads, and the associated increased hardware requirements raise concerns about undesirable centralization.This increased requirement results in full nodes and stragglers synchronizing from signed checkpoints, decreasing the trustless nature of blockchain systems.   In response to these challenges, this paper introduces Chiron, a system designed to extract execution hints for the acceleration of straggling and full nodes.Notably, Chiron achieves this without compromising the security of the system or introducing overhead on the critical path of consensus.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation results demonstrate a notable speedup of up to 30%, effectively addressing the gap between theoretical research and practical deployment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The quantification of this speedup is achieved through realistic blockchain benchmarks derived from a comprehensive analysis of Ethereum and Solana workloads, constituting an independent contribution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span></p>

In this paper, we give a randomized algorithm that finds a set $B\subseteq [n]$ subject to any matroid constraint whose minimum eigenvalue is at least $(1-\epsilon)$ times the optimum, with high probability.The running time of the algorithm is $O\left( n^{O(d\log(d)/\epsilon^2)}\right)$. In particular, our results give a polynomial time asymptotic scheme when the dimension of the vectors is constant.Our algorithm uses a convex programming relaxation of the problem after guessing a rescaling which allows us to apply pipage rounding and matrix Chernoff inequalities to round to a good solution.The key new component is a structural lemma which enables us to "guess'' the appropriate rescaling, which could be of independent interest.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach generalizes the approximation guarantee to monotone, homogeneous functions and as such we can maximize $\det(\sum_{i\in B} v_i v_i^\top)^{1/d}$, or minimize any norm of the eigenvalues of the matrix $\left(\sum_{i\in B} v_i v_i^\top\right)^{-1} $, with the same running time under some mild assumptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>As a byproduct, we also get a simple algorithm for an algorithmic version of Kadison-Singer problem.</p>

                  <p>We devise a parameterized family of distributions, the high-entropy step distributions (HES), which are expressive enough to capture near-optima of spherical spin glass models in the full Replica Symmetry Breaking (fRSB) regime and yet permit low-degree Sum-of-Squares (SoS) certificates that no such distribution can achieve value slightly larger than the true optimum.This yields a SoS optimization program and rounding scheme that attains near-optimal solutions for spherical spin glasses in the fRSB regime.In other regimes, the same results occur at the ALG value, which is a conjectured best-value attainable by any polynomial time algorithm.These SoS programs optimize over families of distributions of possible solutions, and circumvent the oft-cited impossibility of providing a low-degree SoS proof of concentration of measure by instead proving the same bounds only in expectation on solution distributions that can be produced by the chosen rounding algorithm.The new SoS hierarchy does not make any specific reference to the spherical spin glass problem, and we conjecture that it can be applied to a broad range of average-case problems to obtain value that is optimal among polynomial-time algorithms.We give evidence for this with examples of ensembles that provably fool certain local iterative algorithms but for which there is either proof or evidence that the SoS program is better.This opens the door to addressing a question posed by Barak about the possible optimality of SoS on average-case optimization problems, and by Schramm about reductions between different families of algorithms for average-case problems.In this paper, we give low-degree SoS proofs certifying key properties about HES distributions as well as the ALG threshold for spherical spin glasses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The rounding algorithm is introduced and analyzed in a companion paper. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span></p>

                  <p>Without human annotations, a typical Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection (UVAD) method needs to train two models that generate pseudo labels for each other.In previous work, the two models are closely entangled with each other, and it is not known how to upgrade their method without modifying their training framework significantly.Second, previous work usually adopts fixed thresholding to obtain pseudo labels, however the user-specified threshold is not reliable which inevitably introduces errors into the training process.To alleviate these two problems, we propose a novel interleaved framework that alternately trains a One-Class Classification (OCC) model and a Weakly-Supervised (WS) model for UVAD.The OCC or WS models in our method can be easily replaced with other OCC or WS models, which facilitates our method to upgrade with the most recent developments in both fields.For handling the fixed thresholding problem, we break through the conventional cognitive boundary and propose a weighted OCC model that can be trained on both normal and abnormal data.We also propose an adaptive mechanism for automatically finding the optimal threshold for the WS model in a loose to strict manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UVAD method outperforms previous approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

Second, we consider the bypassing model, where requests can be served at a fixed price without fetching the item and its dependencies into the cache -- a variant of caching with dependencies introduced by Bienkowski et al.at SPAA 2017.For this setting, we give an $O( \sqrt{k \cdot \log k})$-competitive algorithm, which significantly improves the best known competitiveness.We conduct a small case study, to find out that our algorithm incurs on average 2x lower cost.</p>
